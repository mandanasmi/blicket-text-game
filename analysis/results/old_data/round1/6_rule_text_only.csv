5c4b987538878c0001c7883b,1,conjunctive,The Nexiom machine only detects Nexioms 1 and 4 if they are on the platform together.
5c4b987538878c0001c7883b,2,conjunctive,Conjunctive - all Nexioms must be tested together to work.
5c4b987538878c0001c7883b,3,disjunctive,Nexioms 2 and 3 act independently.
5c8c22bafeeaeb0016207a00,1,conjunctive,If Objects 1 and 4 are on- the other two can be on or off
5c8c22bafeeaeb0016207a00,2,conjunctive,If Objects 3 and 4 are on- the other two can be on or off
5c8c22bafeeaeb0016207a00,3,disjunctive,"If at least either Object 1 or 2 are on, the others can be on or off"
5e96e85aa7f126177e00ea9f,1,conjunctive,"If both 3 and 4 are chosen, then the machine will switch on."
5e96e85aa7f126177e00ea9f,2,conjunctive,"If both 2 and 4 are chosen, then the machine turns on."
5e96e85aa7f126177e00ea9f,3,disjunctive,"If either 1 or 2 is chosen, then the machine will turn on."
6007421356226920359b5f3e,1,conjunctive,Both object 2 and object 4 need to be on platform
6007421356226920359b5f3e,2,disjunctive,"Either object 1, 4 or both need to be on platform"
6007421356226920359b5f3e,3,disjunctive,"Either object 3, object 4, or both objects 3 and 4 need to be on platform"
60cf0d251a90eb823bc9b740,1,disjunctive,Either 1 or 2 has to be on machine to turn on Nexiom machine
60cf0d251a90eb823bc9b740,2,disjunctive,"If Object 4 OR Object 1 are on the machine, it will turn on"
60cf0d251a90eb823bc9b740,3,conjunctive,Machine will turn on only when objects 2 and 4 are on the machine at the same time
6306710aa6766730321f1259,1,disjunctive,it switches on when at least one item is a nexiom
6306710aa6766730321f1259,2,conjunctive,all nexioms have to be engaged for the machine to activate
6306710aa6766730321f1259,3,disjunctive,at least one nexiom have to be activated for the machine to switch on
64136981aa9af9154f69c8d7,1,conjunctive,"None of the objects are Nexioms, none of them turned on the machine"
64136981aa9af9154f69c8d7,2,disjunctive,The objects turn on the Nexiom machine when they are placed on it - either on their own or with another Nexiom
64136981aa9af9154f69c8d7,3,disjunctive,The nexioms turn on the machine when they are placed on it individually or as a pair.
6448e3fb68d60f161a38f5c9,1,conjunctive,The objects 1 and 3 are only nexioms in combination with each other.
6448e3fb68d60f161a38f5c9,2,conjunctive,Objects 1 and 2 have to be used in combination.
6448e3fb68d60f161a38f5c9,3,disjunctive,Objects 3 and 4 are both nexioms and only need to be present to activate the machine.
669a80310e64395f4edd70b6,1,disjunctive,I texted each object and checked if it is Nexiom
669a80310e64395f4edd70b6,2,disjunctive,"If the correct object (Nexiom) is placed on the machine, it turns on."
669a80310e64395f4edd70b6,3,conjunctive,"Only when all objected on placed on the machine, the machine turns on"
6722ea20fb84b196f0a649b6,1,disjunctive,The machine turns on any time a nexiom is present
6722ea20fb84b196f0a649b6,2,disjunctive,When any of the nexioms are present
6722ea20fb84b196f0a649b6,3,conjunctive,When all nexioms are present
67d43f5c7253c147df75e9e5,1,disjunctive,"When either of the objects is a nexiom, the Nexiom machine will turn ON. If all the objects are non nexiom, the machine will not turn on"
67d43f5c7253c147df75e9e5,2,disjunctive,Presence of ANY nexiom object turned the machine ON
67d43f5c7253c147df75e9e5,3,conjunctive,Presence of Any one nexiom object turns the machine ON
