So, initially, object 6 is already on the machine, and the machine's light is off. That might mean that object 6 alone isn't enough to activate it. But maybe if other objects are added, the machine turns on. Or perhaps the rule isn't about just having any blicket, but a specific combination.\n\nFirst, I need to test different combinations. Let's start by checking if object 6 is a blicket. Since it's already on the machine and the machine is off, maybe it's not a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one. Let me try removing object 6 to see if that changes anything. Wait, but when I remove it, the machine was already off. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I should add another object to the machine along with 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires a certain number of blickets. Let me try putting another object on the machine. Let's pick object 0. So, put object 0 on the machine. Then check if the machine turns on. If it does, then either 0 or 6 is a blicket. But if it's still off, maybe neither is, or the rule is different. Wait, but object 6 was already on the machine. So if adding 0 doesn't activate it, maybe neither are blickets, or the rule is something else like needing exactly two blickets, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets, or a specific configuration. Let me try putting object 1 on the machine with 6. Wait, but step by step. Let's start with a single object. Let's take object 6 off first and see if the machine is off. Then put another object on. Wait, maybe the initial state has object 6 on the machine. Let's check: current objects on the machine are 6. Machine is off. So maybe 6 isn't a blicket. So, take 6 off. Then put 0 on. If machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. Then proceed.\n\nBut since I have limited steps, I need to plan efficiently. Let's try combinations that can eliminate possibilities. Let's start by testing individual objects. Let me remove object 6 first. So command: take 6 off machine. Then machine is empty. Then put 6 back. If machine remains off, then 6 is not a blicket. But maybe the rule is that the machine needs at least two blickets. So if 6 is a blicket, but alone isn't enough. So maybe test 6 with another. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of blicktness is a certain value, or the presence of a specific combination. Let's start by testing individual objects. For example, take 6 off, then put 0 on. Check machine. If it's on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe not. Then take 0 off, put 1 on. Check, etc. But that's time-consuming. Since there are 8 objects, maybe I can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since 6 is on the machine initially and the machine is off, maybe 6 is not a blicket. Let's remove 6 and put another object. For example, take 6 off, put 0 on. If machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. Otherwise, not. Let's try that.\n\nSo first step: take 6 off the machine. Then check the status. Then put 0 on. Then see if the machine is on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then 0 isn't. Let me do that.\n\nWait, but when I take 6 off, the machine's state might change. But since the machine was off before and after removing 6, that doesn't help. Then adding 0. So, let's proceed.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try putting another object on the machine while 6 is still there. For example, put object 0 on the machine. Now machine has 6 and 0. Check if the light turns on. If it does, then at least one of them is a blicket. Then remove one and see. For example, if the light stays on when removing 6, then 0 is the blicket. If it turns off, then 6 is the blicket. But this requires multiple steps.\n\nSo first command: put 0 on machine. Now machine has 6 and 0. Check if light is on. If yes, then one or both are blickets. Then take 6 off. If light stays on, then 0 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 6 was the one.\n\nAlternatively, if adding 0 and 6 doesn't turn it on, then neither are blickets. Let's try that.\n\nSo first step: put 0 on the machine. Then check. If machine is on, proceed. If not, then neither 0 nor 6 are blickets, but maybe the rule is different.\n\nBut let's think about possible rules. Common rules in such problems might be:\n\n- At least one blicket is on the machine (OR).\n- All blickets must be on the machine (AND).\n- The number of blickets is even, odd, or a specific count.\n- A specific combination (e.g., objects 2 and 5 together).\n- The sum of their \"blicktness\" exceeds a threshold.\n\nSince the initial state has 6 on the machine and it's off, maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed, and 6 is one. So adding another would trigger it. Or maybe the rule is that all blickets must be present. But with 8 objects, that's unlikely unless there's a small number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is present. Then, if 6 isn't a blicket, adding a blicket would turn it on. But in the initial state, if 6 was a blicket, the machine would be on. Since it's not, 6 isn't a blicket.\n\nSo perhaps 6 is not a blicket. Let's remove 6 and try adding other objects one by one.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens when we put 0 on the machine along with 6. So command: put 0 on machine. Then check the machine's status. If the light turns on, then either 0, 6, or both are blickets. If not, then neither are.\n\nBut since the initial state had 6 alone and the machine was off, adding 0 might help. So let's try that.\n\nCommand: put 0 on machine.\n\nAfter that, the machine has 0 and 6. If the light is on, then at least one is a blicket. If not, then neither. Then, take 6 off. If the light stays on, then 0 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 6 was the one.\n\nBut if putting 0 and 6 doesn't activate the machine, then maybe neither are blickets, and the rule is more complex. So then, perhaps I should try other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. So if there are multiple blickets, all must be present. So if there are two blickets, putting both would turn it on. But without knowing how many, this is hard to test.\n\nAnother approach is to test pairs. For example, put 0 and 1 on the machine. If that turns it on, then at least one of them is a blicket. Then test each individually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets must be present, and they must be even-numbered, or something like that.\n\nBut given the steps limit, I need to be efficient. Let's start by testing individual objects first.\n\nSo, first, take object 6 off the machine. Command: take 6 off machine. Now, the machine is empty. Then, put 0 on. Check if machine is on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, move on. Then take 0 off, put 1 on, etc. But this would take 8 steps to test all individually, which is time-consuming. Maybe a better way is to test in groups.\n\nAlternatively, if the machine requires at least one blicket, then testing individual objects would find which ones are blickets. But if the rule is more complex, like AND, then individual testing won't work. But since the initial state had one object (6) on the machine and it was off, if the rule is OR, then 6 is not a blicket. So other objects might be.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is AND (all blickets must be on), but there are multiple, but since initially 6 was on and the machine was off, that would mean 6 is not a blicket, and there are others. But without knowing how many, it's hard.\n\nBut perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present. So let's try putting two objects. For example, 0 and 1. If the machine turns on, then at least one of them is a blicket, but maybe both. Then remove one to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is based on the presence of an even number of blickets, or their positions.\n\nBut let's start with the initial step: take 6 off. Then put 0 on. Check machine.\n\nAfter taking 6 off, the machine is empty. Then putting 0 on. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then 0 isn't. Let's try that.\n\nSo commands:\n\n1. take 6 off machine\n2. put 0 on machine\n\nThen check the status. If the machine is on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then 0 isn't. Then take 0 off, put 1 on, etc.\n\nBut I need to do this step by step. Let's proceed."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. \n\nFirst, let's recap the initial state. When I started, object 6 was on the machine, and the light was off. Then I took object 6 off, and the light stayed off. Then I put objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine one by one. After putting object 2 on, the light turned on. So, initially, the machine had object 6, but the light was off. Removing it didn't change anything. Then adding 0, 1, and 2 caused the light to come on when 2 was added.\n\nHmm. So maybe the machine activates when a certain combination of objects is present. But which ones? Let's think. The machine turned on when 0, 1, and 2 were all on it. But maybe some of these are blickets. Alternatively, maybe the presence of object 2 is the key here. Because when I added 2, the light came on. But why? Let's consider possible rules:\n\n1. The machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But initially, object 6 was on the machine, and the light was off. So if 6 isn't a blicket, but maybe 2 is. Then adding 2 would make the machine turn on. But wait, in that case, the machine should have turned on when 2 was added alone. But I added 0, then 1, then 2. The light came on only after 2 was added. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is at least two, or three? Or maybe a specific combination.\n\nWait, let's check the steps again. After taking 6 off, the machine is empty. Then adding 0 (machine has 0) \u2192 light off. Adding 1 (machine has 0 and 1) \u2192 light still off. Adding 2 (machine has 0,1,2) \u2192 light on. So maybe the presence of 0,1, and 2 together activates it. But how do we know which of those are blickets? It could be that all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present. Or maybe two of them are, and the third is a non-blicket, but the rule requires two. Or perhaps there's a different rule, like the sum of some property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 2 is the only blicket, and the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But that contradicts the initial state where object 6 was on the machine and the light was off. Unless object 6 is not a blicket. Wait, but when I first entered, object 6 was on the machine, and the light was off. So if the rule was that having any blicket turns it on, then object 6 isn't a blicket. Then when I added 0,1,2, the light turned on when 2 was added. So maybe 2 is a blicket. But why didn't the light turn on when only 2 was placed? Because in the steps, I added 0, then 1, then 2. So when I added 2, the machine had 0,1,2. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly three objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But that seems unlikely because maybe the initial state had object 6 alone and it was off. So if the rule was three objects, then adding three would activate it. But in the initial state, only 6 was on the machine, so that wouldn't fit. So that's probably not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when there's an odd number of blickets. But with 0,1,2 on, perhaps two of them are blickets. Wait, but then odd vs even... Hmm, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: try to find minimal cases. Now, after putting 0,1,2 on, the machine is on. So maybe any one of these three is a blicket. But if only one was a blicket, then the light should have turned on when that one was added. But when I added 0, the light stayed off. Then added 1, still off. Then added 2, then on. So perhaps the rule is that all three (0,1,2) must be present. If that's the case, then they are all blickets. But how to confirm that? Maybe by removing one and seeing if the light turns off.\n\nSo next step: take one of them off and see. For example, take object 0 off the machine. If the light turns off, then the rule requires all three. If it stays on, then maybe the rule is that at least one is present. But wait, when I first added 0, the light was off. So if 0 was a blicket, adding it alone should turn the light on, but it didn't. So that suggests that 0 is not a blicket. Similarly, adding 1 didn't turn it on. So 1 might not be a blicket. But adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe 2 is the only blicket. But then why did adding it with 0 and 1 make the light on? Because if the rule is that the presence of any blicket, then adding 2 alone should have turned it on. But in the steps, the user added 0, then 1, then 2. So when 2 was added, the machine had all three. But in that case, the light turned on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. Then if 2 is a blicket, adding it would turn the light on. But in this case, adding 2 along with 0 and 1. So the presence of 2 would activate it. But why didn't the light activate when 2 was added? Wait, in the steps, when the user added object 2, the light turned on. So maybe 2 is a blicket. But then why didn't the machine turn on when 6 was initially on it? Because 6 isn't a blicket. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when there's at least one blicket on it. So 2 is a blicket, and when added, the machine turns on. But when 0 and 1 were added, they didn't cause the light to turn on. So perhaps they are not blickets. Then the presence of 2 (a blicket) turns the machine on. But then, in the initial state, object 6 was on the machine, and the light was off. So 6 is not a blicket. Then when I added 0, 1, and 2, the light came on when 2 was added. So 2 is a blicket. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a single blicket is present. But why when I added 2, the machine had 0,1,2. So maybe 2 is the only blicket in that set. Then the presence of 2 is sufficient. So why didn't the machine turn on when 2 was added? Because when 2 was added, the machine had 0,1,2. But if 2 is the only blicket, then the machine should have turned on when 2 was added. So that checks out. So the machine turns on when any blicket is present. So 2 is a blicket. Then, perhaps other objects are also blickets, but need to test.\n\nBut to confirm, maybe I should test adding 2 alone. So next step could be: take 0 and 1 off, leaving 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the rule is more complex.\n\nBut the user has limited steps. So maybe the next step is to take object 0 off the machine. Let's see. If I take 0 off, the machine has 1 and 2. If the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the rule requires all three (0,1,2) to be present. Alternatively, maybe a combination of two.\n\nWait, but according to the previous steps, when the user added 0, 1, then 2, the light turned on when 2 was added. So perhaps the presence of 2 is the key. Let's test that. Take object 0 off the machine. If the light remains on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe 0 is also a blicket. But that seems unlikely because adding 0 alone didn't turn it on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when there are exactly three objects. But in the initial state, object 6 was alone, and the light was off. So that can't be. Or maybe the sum of some property. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the machine turns on when the number of blickets on it is odd. For example, if 2 is a blicket, then adding it (third object) makes the count 1 (odd), so the light turns on. But then if there are three blickets, the count would be 3 (odd). But this requires knowing how many blickets are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets. So adding 0 (not a blicket), then 1 (not), then 2 (yes) would make total 1, which isn't enough. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but in the current state, the machine has 0,1,2. The light is on. So if the rule is that the presence of any blicket turns it on, then at least one of these is a blicket. Let's say 2 is a blicket. Then adding 2 alone should turn it on. But when I added 0 and 1, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So perhaps 2 is the only blicket. Then why didn't adding 2 alone turn it on? Because the user added them sequentially. Wait, the user first put 0 on, then 1, then 2. So after putting 0, the machine had 0. Then 0 and 1. Then 0,1,2. So when 2 was added, the machine had all three. But if the rule is that the machine needs at least one blicket (2), then adding 2 should turn it on regardless of others. So maybe the light turns on as soon as 2 is added. That makes sense. So 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that having any blicket on the machine activates it.\n\nTo test this, remove objects 0 and 1, leaving 2 on the machine. If the light remains on, then that confirms that 2 is a blicket. If the light turns off, then the rule is different.\n\nBut the user can only do one command at a time. So the next step could be to take object 0 off, then check if the light stays on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take object 2 off. If the light turns off, then 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut given the current state, the machine has 0,1,2 on it. The light is on. Let's try removing 2. If the light turns off, that suggests 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one is needed. Because with 0 and 1 left, which might not be blickets, the light turns off.\n\nSo the next command could be 'take object 2 off machine'. Let's see what happens.\n\nBut let's proceed. The user has to output one command. So next step: take object 2 off the machine. If the light turns off, then 2 is a blicket. If it stays on, then maybe 0 or 1 is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take object 0 off first. Let's do that.\n\nWait, but the user already has 0,1,2 on the machine. Let's try taking 0 off.\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nIf after removing 0, the machine has 1 and 2. If the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the combination of 0 and 2 is needed, or something else.\n\nBut given that adding 0 and 1 didn't turn it on, but adding 2 did, perhaps 2 is the key. So taking 0 off, leaving 1 and 2, and the light stays on. Then take 1 off, leaving 2. If the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. Then the rule is that any blicket present activates the machine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. But if 2 is the only one, then adding it would not be enough. But in that case, adding 2 would not activate the machine. But in our case, adding 0,1,2 made it activate. So maybe 0 and 2 are blickets. Then two blickets would activate it. So when 2 was added, making the total two (0 and 2?), but earlier adding 0 alone didn't activate. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is even or odd. But this requires more testing.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to test if 2 is a blicket by removing it and seeing if the light turns off.\n\nSo the next command should be 'take object 2 off machine'."}

Wait, but initially, 0 and 1 were on, but adding 2 made it turn on. So if 2 is a blicket, then the rule could be that at least one blicket is needed. Then, when 2 was added, that's the first blicket, so the machine turns on. But then when I remove 2, it turns off. That fits. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket on it. But let's check. If that's the case, then why did adding 2 make it turn on when 0 and 1 were already there? Because 0 and 1 are not blickets, and 2 is. So when 2 is added, the machine activates. Then, removing 2 (the only blicket) deactivates it. That makes sense. So object 2 is a blicket. But wait, maybe there's more to the rule. Like, maybe the number of blickets must be odd, or something else. But let's test further. Let me try putting object 2 back on the machine again and see if the light turns on. Then maybe add another object and see. For example, put 2 back on, light on. Then add 3, see if it stays on. If it stays on, then 3 might not be a blicket, but if it turns off, maybe the rule is something else. Wait, but I need to be methodical. Let's outline possible steps. First, confirm that object 2 is a blicket. So put object 2 on the machine alone. If the light turns on, then that confirms it. Then check other objects individually. But let's try that. So next step: put object 2 on machine. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. Then take it off, light off. Then test another object, like 3. Put 3 on machine. If light doesn't turn on, then 3 is not a blicket. Then maybe check 6. Earlier, object 6 was on the machine, and the light was off. So 6 is not a blicket. So current possible blickets: 2. But maybe there's another. Let's test. So next command: put object 2 on machine. If light turns on, that confirms. But in the current state, after taking 2 off, objects 0 and 1 are still on the machine, and the light is off. So if I put 2 back on, the machine should turn on again. Let me do that. So command: put object 2 on machine. Let's see what happens."}

The goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nSo far, the initial state had object 6 on the machine, but the light was off. Then, when I took object 6 off, the light stayed off. Then I put objects 0 and 1 on the machine, but the light remained off. When I added object 2, the light turned on. Then, removing object 2 made it turn off again, and putting it back on turned it on again. \n\nThis suggests that object 2 is a blicket. But maybe there's more to the rule. Let me think: when I added 0 and 1, nothing happened. But when I added 2, it turned on. Then, removing 2 turned it off. So the machine's state is directly dependent on the presence of object 2. That makes me think that maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. But wait, maybe it's more specific. For example, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket, or a certain number. \n\nBut in the first test, when I added 0, 1, and then 2, the light turned on when 2 was added. Since 0 and 1 were already on the machine, adding 2 (a possible blicket) activated it. Then removing 2 deactivated it. So maybe object 2 is the only blicket so far. But there could be others. \n\nBut wait, initially, object 6 was on the machine, and the light was off. So maybe object 6 isn't a blicket. But when I took it off, the light stayed off. Then adding 0, 1, and 2 (with 2 being the key) turned it on. Then removing 2 turned it off. So perhaps 2 is a blicket, and the machine's rule is that it activates when at least one blicket is present. But I need to check other objects to confirm. \n\nLet me see: next step could be to test other objects. For example, put object 3 on the machine. If the light stays off, then 3 is not a blicket. But if I put 3 on with 2, maybe the light stays on. Alternatively, if the rule is that the machine requires exactly one blicket, but that seems less likely since when 2 was added, the light came on even with 0 and 1 (non-blickets) present. \n\nWait, when I added 0 and 1, the machine was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So 2's presence caused activation, even with others. So maybe 2 is a blicket and the rule is that having any blicket (regardless of others) activates the machine. But to confirm, I need to test other objects. \n\nFor example, if I take 2 off and try putting another object alone. Let's say, take 2 off (machine off), then put object 3 on. If machine turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 2 is the only one. \n\nBut in the current state, the machine has objects 0, 1, and 2 on it, and the light is on. But after taking 2 off, the machine had 0 and 1, light off. Then putting 2 back made it on. So, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. But how to check if other objects are blickets. \n\nLet me try putting object 4 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 4 is a blicket. But if it doesn't, then maybe not. But right now, the machine has 0,1,2 on it. Let me take 2 off first, then add 4. \n\nWait, the current state after the last command is: objects 0,1,2 are on the machine, and the light is on. Then, taking 2 off would leave 0 and 1, light off. Then add 4. If light stays off, then 4 is not a blicket. Then add 2 again, light on. \n\nBut I need to be careful with the steps. Let's plan the next steps. \n\nBut the user is expecting the next command. So maybe in the next step, I should test another object. For example, take object 2 off again (since that's the current state after putting 2 back on). Then, try putting another object on the machine to see if it activates the light. \n\nWait, current state after the last action: object 0,1,2 are on the machine. Light is on. Then take object 2 off (light turns off). Then put object 3 on. If light stays off, then 3 is not a blicket. Then put object 2 back on, light on. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when there's an odd number of blickets. But that's more complicated. Let's try simpler. \n\nSo the next step: take object 2 off machine. Then check if the machine is off. Then put object 3 on. If the machine remains off, then 3 is not a blicket. Then maybe try object 4. \n\nBut each step is a command. Let's proceed step by step. \n\nBut the current step: the user just put object 2 on the machine again, and the light is on. So the machine has 0,1,2 on it. \n\nWait, in the previous commands:\n\n- After taking 6 off, the machine was empty.\n\n- Then put 0 on: machine has 0, light off.\n\n- Then put 1 on: machine has 0,1. Light still off.\n\n- Then put 2 on: machine has 0,1,2. Light turns on.\n\n- Take 2 off: machine has 0,1. Light off.\n\n- Put 2 back on: machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nSo the presence of 2 is causing the light to turn on. Now, perhaps to test if 2 is the only blicket, we can remove other objects. For example, take 0 and 1 off, leaving only 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, then 2 alone is sufficient. \n\nBut in the current state, the machine has 0,1,2. Light is on. If I take 0 off, then 1 and 2 are on. If the light stays on, that supports that 2 is a blicket. Then take 1 off, leaving 2. If light remains on, then 2 is a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule requires a combination. But the initial test suggests that 2 is key. Let's try that. \n\nSo next command: take object 0 off machine. Then observe if light stays on. \n\nBut the current commands need to be output as per the format. \n\nSo the next command would be to take object 0 off the machine. But let's see: \n\nCurrent state: machine has 0,1,2. Light on. \n\nTake object 0 off. If light remains on, then 1 and 2 are present, so if 1 is not a blicket, but 2 is, then light stays on. If 1 is a blicket, then maybe removing 0 doesn't matter. \n\nBut in previous steps, adding 0 and 1 didn't turn on the light. Adding 2 did. So 0 and 1 are likely not blickets. \n\nSo taking 0 off the machine would leave 1 and 2. If the light remains on, then 2 is a blicket and the presence of 1 doesn't affect it. \n\nBut I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the total number of blickets is >=1. So if 2 is a blicket, then as long as it's present, regardless of others, the machine is on. \n\nSo taking 0 off would leave 1 and 2. If light remains on, then 2 is a blicket. Then take 1 off, leaving 2. Light should stay on. \n\nSo next steps: take 0 off, then take 1 off. \n\nBut each step counts. Let's proceed. \n\nNext command: take object 0 off machine. \n\nBut wait, in the previous steps, after putting 2 back on, the machine has 0,1,2. So taking 0 off would be the next step. \n\nIf the light stays on, that suggests that 2 is the only blicket. Then take 1 off, leaving 2 alone. Light should stay on. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires exactly one blicket. But when 0,1,2 were on, the light was on. If 0 and 1 are not blickets, then the presence of 2 (a blicket) would activate it regardless of others. So that's more likely. \n\nSo, the next command should be to take object 0 off the machine. Let's do that."}

The goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. So far, here's what happened:\n\nInitially, object 6 was on the machine, but the machine was off. Then, after removing object 6 and placing objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine, the machine turned on when object 2 was added. When I took object 2 off, it turned off again. Then putting object 2 back on turned it on again. But when I took object 0 off while object 2 was still on, the machine turned off. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So when object 2 was on the machine alone (after removing 0), the machine was off. Wait, no. Let me check the steps again:\n\n1. After putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light turned on when 2 was placed. Then taking 2 off turned it off. Putting 2 back on turned it on again. Then taking 0 off made the light turn off. So with objects 1 and 2 on the machine, the light was off. But when object 0 was on the machine along with 1 and 2, the light was on. Hmm, maybe the presence of object 0 is required along with 2? Or maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, let's retrace the steps precisely:\n\n- Initially, object 6 was on the machine. The light was off.\n- Took 6 off, light still off.\n- Put 0 on: light off.\n- Put 1 on: light off.\n- Put 2 on: light turns on.\n- Took 2 off: light off.\n- Put 2 back on: light on again.\n- Then took 0 off: light off.\n\nSo when objects 1 and 2 were on the machine (after removing 0), the light turned off. But when 0,1,2 were on, the light was on. Then taking 0 off caused the light to turn off, even though 1 and 2 were still there. That suggests that object 0 and 2 together might be necessary. Wait, but when 2 was added after 0 and 1, the light turned on. Then removing 0 while keeping 1 and 2 made it turn off. So perhaps the rule requires both 0 and 2 to be present? But then why did the light turn on when 2 was added to 0 and 1? Or maybe the presence of 2 alone isn't enough, but when combined with 0, it works. But then when 0 was removed, even with 2 present, the light went off. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. But wait, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, the light turned on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, but requires another blicket? Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when there's at least one blicket, but only if another condition is met. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be present. Let's see.\n\nWait, when 0,1,2 were on the machine, the light turned on when 2 was added. So prior to adding 2, 0 and 1 were on the machine, but the light was off. Adding 2 made it turn on. Then removing 2 made it turn off. Adding 2 again turned it on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) made it turn off. So maybe object 0 and 2 are both blickets, and the machine requires at least two blickets to activate. But when 0 and 2 were both on the machine (along with 1), the light was on. Then removing 0 left 1 and 2, so only one blicket (2) if 1 isn't a blicket. Wait, but maybe 1 isn't a blicket. So the presence of both 0 and 2 (two blickets) turns it on. But when 2 was added to 0 and 1, it turned on. So perhaps 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Or maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Or maybe it's a certain combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two specific objects are on it. For example, when 0 and 2 are both present. But when 0 was removed, leaving 1 and 2, the machine turned off. So perhaps the presence of both 0 and 2 is necessary.\n\nBut let's think of other possibilities. Maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets. Or maybe a certain total weight, but that seems less likely. Another angle: When 6 was initially on the machine, the light was off. So 6 is not a blicket. Then, when 0,1,2 were added, the light turned on when 2 was placed. So perhaps 2 is a blicket, and the presence of at least one blicket turns it on. But then why did the light turn off when 0 was removed? Because when 0 was removed, 1 and 2 were still there. If 2 is a blicket, the machine should stay on. Unless 0 is also a blicket and the rule requires both. But that would mean that 0 and 2 are both blickets, and the machine requires all blickets to be present. Wait, but initially, 6 was on the machine, and maybe 6 isn't a blicket, so the machine was off. Then, when 0,1,2 were added, the light turned on when 2 was added. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. But when 2 was on the machine alone (after taking 0 and 1 off?), wait, let's check again:\n\nWait, after putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light turned on when 2 was added. Then, when 2 was taken off, the light turned off. Then putting 2 back on turned it on again. Then taking 0 off (so now 1 and 2 are on the machine) turned the light off. So with 2 on and 1 on, the light is off. But when 0 was there with 1 and 2, it was on. So maybe 0 and 2 together make the light on, but 2 alone (with 1) doesn't. So perhaps the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. Then they are both blickets. But what about other combinations? For example, what if we test putting 0 and 2 on without 1? Let's see. The user hasn't tried that yet. So maybe the next step is to test that.\n\nSo, currently, after the last command, the machine has object 1 and 2 on it, but the light is off. Then, the user took 0 off, leaving 1 and 2. So, the light is off. So if I put 0 back on, along with 2, and remove 1, does the light turn on? Let's try that.\n\nBut how to proceed. The user's next step could be to test whether 0 and 2 together (without 1) activate the machine. So, perhaps:\n\nTake object 1 off the machine, then put object 0 and 2 on. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state: objects on the machine are 1 and 2. Light is off.\n\nIf I take 1 off, the machine will have only 2. Then put 0 on. Then check if the light turns on. If it does, that would confirm that 0 and 2 together are the key. Alternatively, if the light doesn't turn on unless both are present.\n\nSo, possible steps:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nIf the light turns on, that would suggest that 0 and 2 together (since 2 is already there) activate it. If not, then maybe there's another factor. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of the objects' numbers must be even, or something else. But that seems less likely. Let's try to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present, and 0 and 2 are blickets. So when both are on, it's on. When only one is on, it's off.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when 0,1,2 were on (with 0 and 2 as blickets), the machine was on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 (only one blicket), so it turns off. Then putting 0 back would add the second blicket, turning it on again.\n\nSo the next step would be to test if 0 and 2 alone (without 1) activate the machine. So the user needs to take 1 off, then check if 0 and 2 are present. Let's proceed with that."}

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Let me recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, object 6 was on the machine, but when I took it off, the machine's light stayed off. Then I put objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine one by one. After putting 0 and 1, the light was still off. But when I added object 2, the light turned on. Then when I removed 2, the light went off again. Putting 2 back made it come on again. Then removing 0 and 1 didn't affect it once 2 was off. Wait, no\u2014after removing 0 and 1, when 2 was on, the light was on. Then taking 0 and 1 off after removing 2 didn't change anything because 2 wasn't there anymore.\n\nSo from this, it seems like object 2 is a blicket because when it's on the machine, the light turns on. But when it's removed, the light goes off. But wait, when I first put 0 and 1 on, the light stayed off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. Then removing 2 made it turn off. But when I put 2 back alone, the light came on. That suggests that object 2 alone is sufficient to activate the machine. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it, and object 2 is a blicket. But wait, when object 6 was initially on the machine, the light was off. So maybe object 6 isn't a blicket. But when I took it off, the light was still off. Then when I added 0, 1, 2, only 2 made it work. So maybe 2 is a blicket. But I need to check other objects to confirm.\n\nBut maybe the rule is more complex. For example, maybe the machine requires a certain number of blickets, or a specific combination. Let's see. When I had 0,1,2 on the machine, adding 2 made it turn on. Then when 2 was alone, it worked. So that suggests that 2 is a blicket and that the rule is that at least one blicket is present. But then why wasn't the machine on when object 6 was initially on it? Because maybe 6 isn't a blicket. So the initial state had 6 on the machine, but the light was off. Therefore, 6 isn't a blicket. Then when I put 0,1,2 on, only 2 is a blicket. So the machine turns on when any blicket is present. But to confirm this, I need to test other objects. For example, putting object 3,4,5,7 on the machine to see if any of them activate it alone. But since I have limited steps, maybe I should test other objects individually.\n\nSo next step: put another object on the machine alone and see if the light turns on. Let's try object 3. If I put object 3 on the machine and the light doesn't turn on, then it's not a blicket. If it does, then it is. Similarly for others. But since I already saw that 2 works alone, maybe there are multiple blickets. But maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket is needed, or a certain number. But given that 2 alone works, and 0 and 1 didn't, maybe only 2 is a blicket. But maybe others also are, but require being combined. Wait, when I put 0 and 1 on, the light was off. Adding 2 made it on. So 2 is a blicket. Then removing 0 and 1 but leaving 2 on kept it on. Then removing 2 turned it off. So that seems to confirm that 2 is the only blicket so far. But there might be others. For example, maybe 7 is a blicket, but needs to be combined with 2. Or maybe other objects are blickets but weren't tested yet. So to be thorough, I should test each object individually.\n\nBut since I have limited steps, maybe I should check others. Let's see. The initial objects on the machine were 6, which when removed, the light stayed off. So 6 is not a blicket. Then 0,1 were added and nothing happened. Then adding 2 made it work. So 2 is a blicket. Let's test object 3 alone. So next command: put object 3 on machine. If the light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, then not. Let's try that."}

The goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, when objects 0, 1, and 2 were on the machine, the light turned on. But when I took off 2, it turned off. Then putting 2 back alone made it turn on again. Then when I removed 0 and 1, leaving only 2, the light stayed on.

But wait, when object 2 was on the machine alone, the light was on. Then when 0 and 1 were added, it was still on. Then removing 0 and 1 left 2, which kept it on. Then taking 2 off turned it off. Then putting 2 back on alone turned it on again. So that suggests that 2 is a blicket. But when I put 3 on, it didn't turn on, so 3 isn't a blicket. But maybe there's more to the rule. Wait, when I first put 0, 1, and 2 on, the light turned on. But when 0 and 1 were on without 2, the light was off. Then putting 2 made it on. So 2 must be a blicket. Then putting 3 alone didn't work. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket. But I need to test more objects. Let me see.\n\nWait, after taking 2 off, the light went off. Then putting 2 back on made it on again. Then removing 0 and 1 (so only 2 is on) kept it on. So 2 alone is sufficient. Then putting 3 on the machine (now 2 and 3 are on) would the light stay on? Wait, no, the last action was putting 3 on the machine when 2 was already on. But the light was off? Wait, the user input says after putting object 3 on the machine, the light is off. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me check the history again.\n\nOriginal setup: objects 0-7. Initially, 6 was on the machine. Then user took 6 off. Then put 0, 1, 2 on. Light turned on when 2 was added. Then took 2 off, light off. Put 2 back on, light on. Then took 0 and 1 off, light remained on (since 2 was still there). Then put 3 on machine. But the light is off. Wait, that's conflicting. If 2 is a blicket and is on the machine, adding 3 (non-blicket) shouldn't turn it off. Unless the rule is different. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when exactly one blicket is present. But that doesn't fit. Wait, when 2 was on with 0 and 1, the light was on. Then taking 2 off made it off. Putting 2 back made it on again. Then removing 0 and 1, leaving only 2, light stayed on. Then putting 3 on the machine (so 2 and 3 are on), the light turned off? But that contradicts. Or maybe the user made a mistake here. Wait, the last action was putting object 3 on the machine, and the light was off. So if 2 was already on the machine, adding 3 made the light go off. That suggests that the presence of 3 somehow cancels the effect. Or maybe the rule is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the machine's state updates only when you add or remove objects. Wait, the previous step: after taking 0 and 1 off, leaving 2 on the machine, the light was off? No, according to the user's output:\n\nAfter taking object 0 off the machine: light is off. Then taking object 1 off: light is off. Then putting object 3 on the machine: light is off. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck the user's steps:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on, light was on. Then take 2 off: light off. Put 2 back: light on. Then take 0 off: light off. Then take 1 off: light off. Wait, that's not possible. Because after putting 2 back on, the machine is on. Then removing 0 and 1 (which were on the machine), leaving 2 on, should keep the machine on. But according to the user's output, after taking 0 off, the light is off. That suggests that when you take 0 off, the machine turns off. But 2 was still on. So maybe 0 and 2 are both blickets. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me retrace the steps step by step.\n\n1. Initial state: objects 0-7, 6 on machine. Others on floor.\n2. Take object 6 off machine. Now all objects on floor except none on machine. Light off.\n3. Put object 0 on machine. Machine has 0. Light off.\n4. Put object 1 on machine. Machine has 0,1. Light off.\n5. Put object 2 on machine. Machine has 0,1,2. Light turns on.\n6. Take 2 off. Machine has 0,1. Light off.\n7. Put 2 back on. Machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n8. Take 0 off. Machine has 1,2. Light off? But if 2 is a blicket, then having 2 on should keep the light on. So why did the light turn off when taking 0 off? That suggests that 0 is also a blicket, and the rule requires all blickets to be present. Or maybe the rule is that the sum of blicktness must meet a certain threshold. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Let's see:\n\nWhen 0,1,2 were on, light on. Taking 2 off (leaving 0,1) light off. Putting 2 back (0,1,2) light on. Then taking 0 off (1,2) light off. Hmm, so perhaps 0 and 2 are both blickets. Then when both are present, the light is on. If either is missing, it's off. But when 2 was on alone (after removing 0 and 1), the light was off. Wait, no, after step 7, when you put 2 back on, machine has 0,1,2 and light is on. Then step 8: take 0 off. Machine has 1,2. Light is off. Then step 9: take 1 off. Machine has 2. Light is off. Then step 10: put 3 on. Machine has 2 and 3. Light is off. So in that case, when only 2 is on the machine, light is off. But earlier when 2 was added alone (step 7: after taking 2 off and putting it back on), the machine was on. Wait, let me check step 7 again:\n\nAfter step 5: machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nStep 6: take 2 off. Machine has 0,1. Light off.\n\nStep 7: put 2 on. Now machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nStep 8: take 0 off. Machine has 1,2. Light off.\n\nSo when 0 is removed, even though 2 is still present, the light turns off. That suggests that 0 is a blicket. But then in step 7, when 2 was added back, along with 0 and 1, the light was on. So maybe both 0 and 2 are blickets. Then, the rule could be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Or maybe it's a specific combination. Alternatively, perhaps the machine requires all blickets to be present. Let's think.\n\nIf 0 and 2 are blickets, then:\n\n- 0,1,2 on: light on (has 0 and 2)\n- Take 2 off: only 0,1. Light off (missing 2)\n- Put 2 back: 0,1,2. Light on.\n- Take 0 off: 1,2. Light off (missing 0)\n- Take 1 off: 2. Light off (only 2, missing 0)\n- Put 3 on: 2,3. Light off.\n\nBut then, if the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present, then when both are on, the machine is on. Otherwise, off. But how to confirm this? Let's test putting 0 and 2 on without others.\n\nBut the user hasn't tried that yet. Let's see. The next step after putting 3 on (step 10) is to maybe test combinations with 0 and 2. For example, take all off and put 0 and 2 on.\n\nSo, possible next step: take 2 and 3 off, then put 0 and 2 on. Then see if light is on. If yes, then 0 and 2 are both blickets. But perhaps the user needs to do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But in step 5, adding 2 made it turn on. So if 2 is a blicket, then having it alone should work. But when it was alone (after step 9: machine has 2), the light was off. Wait, that's conflicting. Because after step 7, when 2 was added back with 0 and 1, the light was on. Then taking 0 off (step 8) left 1 and 2, light off. Taking 1 off (step9) left 2 alone, light off. So that suggests that 2 alone doesn't turn the machine on. But earlier, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, the light turned on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, but the machine requires another condition. Wait, perhaps the machine requires at least two blickets. Then 0 and 2 could be blickets. So when both are on, the machine is on. Otherwise, off.\n\nLet me think: when 0,1,2 are on (step5), light on. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then two blickets are present. Then step6: remove 2, leaving 0 and 1. Light off (only one blicket). Step7: add 2 back (0,1,2). Two blickets, light on. Step8: remove 0, leaving 1 and 2. Only one blicket (2), light off. Step9: remove 1, leaving 2. Still one blicket, light off. Step10: add 3. Now 2 and 3. No new blicket. Light off. So if the rule is that at least two blickets must be present, and 0 and 2 are blickets, that fits.\n\nBut how to confirm this. For example, if we put 0 and 2 on the machine, without others, the light should turn on. Let's test that. So next step: take 2,3 off the machine. Then put 0 and 2 on. If light turns on, that supports the rule. If not, something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 is also a blicket. But in step5, when 0,1,2 are on, light on. If 0,1,2 are all blickets, then three blickets. Step6: remove 2 (now 0,1: two blickets). But light turns off. So that contradicts if the rule is at least two. So 1 can't be a blicket. So likely, 0 and 2 are blickets. Rule: at least two blickets must be present. Or maybe exactly two.\n\nWait, but if the rule is exactly two, then adding a third would turn it off. But in step5, three objects (0,1,2) are on, but light is on. If two of them are blickets, then adding a third non-blicket (like 1) wouldn't affect. So the light stays on. So the rule could be at least two blickets.\n\nBut to test, let's try putting 0 and 2 on. If that turns the light on, then the rule is at least two. If not, maybe something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of blickets is odd. But that doesn't fit because two blickets would be even. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on it. But how many blickets are there? If there are two (0 and 2), then when both are on, the machine is on. Otherwise, off. That fits the previous steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Step5: 0,1,2 on. Both 0 and 2 are blickets. So both are present. Light on.\n- Step6: remove 2. Only 0 (blicket) and 1. So missing 2. Light off.\n- Step7: add 2 back. Both blickets present. Light on.\n- Step8: remove 0. Only 2 (blicket) present. Light off.\n- Step9: remove 1. Only 2. Light off.\n- Step10: add 3. 2 and 3. Only 2 is blicket. Light off.\n\nThis fits the rule that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there are more than two blickets, this would change. For example, if there are three blickets, then all three must be present. But in the initial steps, adding 0,1,2 made it on. If 0 and 2 are the only blickets, then that's why it turned on. But when 2 was alone, it's off because 0 is missing. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But how to confirm this.\n\nWait, but if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then the number of blickets could be more than two. For example, maybe there's a third blicket, like 3, but the user hasn't tested that. But in step10, putting 3 on (with 2) didn't turn it on. So 3 is not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly the blicket(s) to be present, but the user hasn't found all. For example, maybe 0 and 2 are the only blickets, and the rule is both must be present.\n\nBut the user needs to test this. For example, take all objects off, then put 0 and 2 on. If the light turns on, then the rule is that both must be present. If not, something else.\n\nIn the current state, after step10, the machine has object 2 and 3 on. Light is off. So next steps could be taking 3 off, then 2 off, then putting 0 and 2 on.\n\nSo the next command should be to take 3 off the machine to test.\n\nWait, the current state after step10 is: machine has 2 and 3 on, light off. The user needs to test if putting 0 and 2 on will turn the light on.\n\nSo, possible steps:\n\ntake object 3 off machine \u2192 machine has 2. Light remains off.\n\ntake object 2 off machine \u2192 machine empty. Light off.\n\nput object 0 on machine \u2192 machine has 0. Light off.\n\nput object 2 on machine \u2192 machine has 0 and 2. If light turns on, then the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. If not, another rule.\n\nSo the next step is to remove 3, then 2, then try adding 0 and 2.\n\nBut the user has limited steps. Let's see how many steps have been used so far. The user's commands so far are:\n\n1. take 6 off machine (error)\n2. take object 6 off machine\n3. put object 0 on machine\n4. put object 1 on machine\n5. put object 2 on machine\n6. take object 2 off machine\n7. put object 2 on machine\n8. take object 0 off machine\n9. take object 1 off machine\n10. put object 3 on machine\n\nThat's 10 steps. So they have 22 left. \n\nThe next logical step is to test 0 and 2 together. So first, take object 3 off the machine. Then take object 2 off. Then put 0 on, then put 2 on. But that's four steps. Alternatively, since object 3 is on the machine now, take it off first.\n\nSo the next command would be: take object 3 off machine. Then see what happens. Then take 2 off, etc.\n\nBut the user can only input one command at a time. So the next command should be to take object 3 off the machine. Let's see:\n\n> take object 3 off machine\n\nAfter taking 3 off, the machine has only object 2. Light remains off. Then take 2 off. Then put 0 and 2 on. But the user needs to do this step by step.\n\nBut maybe the user can try another approach. For example, put object 4 on the machine to see if adding another object with 2 will turn the light on. But that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, since the current state is machine has 2 and 3, light off. So taking 3 off leaves 2. Light still off. Then taking 2 off leaves nothing. Then putting 0 and 2 on. But that's several steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can check other objects. For example, put object 4 on the machine. If light turns on, then 4 is a blicket. But given the previous results, it's unlikely. Alternatively, put object 5 on with 2.\n\nBut perhaps the more efficient step is to test the combination of 0 and 2. So the next step should be to remove 3 and 2, then add 0 and 2. But since each step is a command, the next command is likely to take object 3 off the machine."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, when objects 0, 1, and 2 were on the machine, the light turned on. But when I removed object 2, the light went off. Then putting object 2 back alone made the light turn on again. Then adding objects 0 and 1 didn't keep the light on when 2 was removed. Wait, no. Let me recap:\n\nInitially, all objects except 6 were on the floor. Then they took object 6 off the machine. Then they put 0, 1, and 2 on the machine. The light turned on when 2 was added. Then removing 2 turned it off. Adding 2 back alone turned it on again. Then removing 0 and 1 didn't affect the light as long as 2 was there. Wait, no. Wait, when they put 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. Then taking 2 off made it go off. Putting 2 back on alone turned it on. So, that suggests that object 2 is a blicket, and maybe the machine only needs at least one blicket to activate. But when they put object 3 on, the light didn't turn on, so maybe 3 is not a blicket. But wait, maybe there's a different rule. Let me check the steps again:\n\n1. After putting 0, 1, 2 on the machine, the light turns on when 2 is added. So, perhaps 2 is a blicket. Then removing 2 (leaving 0 and 1) turns it off. Then putting 2 back alone (so only 2 is on the machine) turns it on. That suggests that the machine activates when there's at least one blicket. So 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not. Then when they tried adding 3, the machine didn't turn on, so 3 isn't a blicket. But maybe the rule is more complex. Like, maybe the sum of blickets' \"blicktness\" has to reach a certain threshold. Or maybe a specific combination.\n\nWait, but when only object 2 was on the machine, the light was on. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when any blicket is present. So 2 is a blicket. Then why when 0 and 1 were added, the machine was off? Wait, no. Let me recheck the steps:\n\nOriginal state: 6 was on the machine, others on floor. Then they took 6 off. Then added 0, 1, 2. The light turned on when 2 was added. Wait, the steps were:\n\n- put object 0 on machine (light off)\n- put object 1 on machine (light off)\n- put object 2 on machine (light on)\n\nSo, when 2 was added, the light turned on. Then taking 2 off (leaving 0 and 1) turned it off. So 0 and 1 alone don't activate it. Then putting 2 back alone (so only 2 on the machine) makes it turn on again. Then removing 0 and 1 (so 2 is still on) leaves it on? Wait, no. Wait, after putting 2 back on, the light is on. Then the user takes 0 and 1 off. The machine's light was already on when 2 was on, so taking 0 and 1 off (which are not blickets) wouldn't affect it. But the user took 0 off, then 1 off. The light was off after each step? Wait, let's see:\n\nAfter putting 2 back on the machine (so only 2 is on), the light is on. Then they take 0 off (which was already off, maybe? Wait, maybe the user's steps are a bit confusing. Let me re-express the steps properly.\n\nOriginal setup after taking 6 off:\n\nAll objects on floor except machine is empty.\n\nUser actions:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n2. put object 1 on machine \u2192 light off.\n3. put object 2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n4. take object 2 off \u2192 light off.\n5. put object 2 on \u2192 light on.\n6. take object 0 off \u2192 light off. Wait, but 0 was on the machine? Or was it already removed?\n\nWait, after step 3: objects 0,1,2 are on the machine. Light is on.\n\nStep 4: take object 2 off \u2192 now 0 and 1 are on machine. Light off.\n\nStep 5: put object 2 back \u2192 now 0,1,2 are on machine again. Light on.\n\nThen step 6: take object 0 off \u2192 now 1 and 2 on machine. What's the light status? The output says after taking 0 off, the light is off. Wait, but if 2 is a blicket and the rule is presence of any blicket, then with 2 on the machine, the light should stay on. But according to the user's output, after taking 0 off, the light is off. That contradicts the previous assumption. So maybe the rule isn't that simple.\n\nWait, let's check the exact user command outputs:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on machine, light is on when 2 is added. Then taking 2 off \u2192 light off. Then putting 2 back on \u2192 light on. Then taking 0 off \u2192 light off. Taking 1 off \u2192 light off. So, when 2 is alone on the machine, the light is on. But when they took 0 off (which was part of the group with 1 and 2), the light turned off. That suggests that the presence of 2 alone isn't sufficient. Wait, that's a contradiction. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the exact steps:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n\nTake object 2 off \u2192 light off (now 0 and 1 on machine).\n\nPut 2 back \u2192 light on (now 0,1,2 on machine).\n\nTake 0 off \u2192 light off (now 1 and 2 on machine).\n\nHmm, that's strange. If 2 is a blicket, then with 2 and 1 on the machine, the light should be on. But according to the output, taking 0 off caused the light to turn off. So maybe the rule is that all objects on the machine must be blickets. So if 2 is a blicket, but 1 is not, then when 1 and 2 are on the machine, the presence of a non-blicket (1) would deactivate it. Wait, but that doesn't fit with the previous steps. Let's see:\n\nIf the rule is that all objects on the machine must be blickets for it to activate.\n\nSo when 0,1,2 are on the machine, if any of them is a non-blicket, the machine is off. But when 2 is added, maybe 2 is a blicket and 0 and 1 are not. But in that case, having all three (0,1,2) would mean there are non-blickets (0,1) on the machine, so the machine should be off. But according to the output, when 2 was added, the light turned on. So that contradicts the \"all must be blickets\" rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket and no non-blickets. Wait, but that's the same as all being blickets. Hmm. Alternatively, the rule could be that the total number of blickets is odd, or some other combination.\n\nWait, let's try to model this step by step.\n\nCase 1: Objects 0,1,2 on machine. Light turns on when 2 is added. So when 0 and 1 are on, light is off. Adding 2 (so 0,1,2) turns it on.\n\nThen taking 2 off (leaving 0,1) turns it off.\n\nPutting 2 back (0,1,2) turns it on.\n\nTaking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) turns it off.\n\nTaking 1 off (leaving 2) turns it off? Wait, no. Let me check the actual outputs:\n\nAfter putting 2 back on (so 0,1,2 on machine) \u2192 light on.\n\nThen take 0 off \u2192 machine has 1 and 2. Light is off.\n\nTake 1 off \u2192 machine has only 2. Light is off.\n\nWait, but earlier, when they put 2 on alone (after taking 0 and 1 off), the light was on. Wait, no:\n\nWait, after step 5: after taking 2 off (leaving 0 and 1), light off. Then put 2 on again \u2192 now 0,1,2 on machine \u2192 light on. Then take 0 off \u2192 machine has 1 and 2 \u2192 light off. Then take 1 off \u2192 machine has only 2 \u2192 light off. But earlier, when they put 2 on alone (after 0 and 1 were removed), the light turned on. So there's inconsistency here. Unless there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, let me retrace the steps:\n\n1. Initial state: objects 0-7 on floor except 6 on machine. User takes 6 off, so all on floor.\n\n2. User puts 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n3. Puts 1 on \u2192 light off.\n\n4. Puts 2 on \u2192 light on.\n\nSo, adding 2 causes the light to turn on. Then:\n\n5. Take 2 off \u2192 light off (0 and 1 on machine).\n\n6. Put 2 back \u2192 light on (0,1,2 on machine).\n\n7. Take 0 off \u2192 light off (1 and 2 on machine).\n\n8. Take 1 off \u2192 light off (only 2 on machine).\n\n9. Then user puts 3 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nSo, when 2 is alone on the machine, the light is off. But earlier, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, it turned on. Then when 2 was put back alone (after removing 0 and 1), the light was on? Wait, no. Let me check the exact outputs:\n\nAfter step 6: \"You put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So after putting 2 back (when 0 and 1 were already on the machine), the light is on. Then step 7: take 0 off \u2192 light off. Now machine has 1 and 2. Light off. Then step 8: take 1 off \u2192 light off. Machine has only 2. Then step 9: put 3 on \u2192 light off.\n\nWait, so when 2 is alone on the machine, the light is off. But earlier, when 2 was added to 0 and 1 (making 0,1,2), the light turned on. That suggests that the presence of 2 along with 0 and 1 is required. But when 2 is alone, it's off. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets. Wait, but in that case, adding 2 (assuming it's a blicket) to 0 and 1 (non-blickets) wouldn't help. Unless 0 or 1 are also blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires a specific combination. For example, the sum of certain features. Or maybe the rule is that the number of blickets must be even, or odd. Let's see.\n\nWhen 0,1,2 are on the machine, the count is 3. If the rule is that the number of blickets is odd, but only if there's at least one. Wait, but we don't know which are blickets. Let's hypothesize that 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not. Then in the case of 0,1,2: 1 blicket (odd), so light on. When 2 is alone: 1 blicket (still odd), so light should be on. But according to the steps, when 2 is alone, the light is off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. If 0 and 2 are blickets, but 1 is not. Then 0 and 2 would make two, but in the initial test, adding 0,1,2 (two blickets) would turn it on. But when 2 is alone, it's one, so off. But when the user added 2 to 0 and 1, maybe 0 and 2 are blickets. But earlier, when 0 was on alone, the light was off. So if 0 is a blicket, putting it alone should activate the machine. But in step 2, putting 0 on machine \u2192 light off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's try another approach. Let's list all the observed states and their outcomes.\n\nStates and outcomes:\n\n1. Machine empty \u2192 light off.\n\n2. 0 on \u2192 off.\n\n3. 0,1 on \u2192 off.\n\n4. 0,1,2 on \u2192 on.\n\n5. 0,1 on \u2192 off (after removing 2).\n\n6. 0,1,2 on \u2192 on (after adding 2 back).\n\n7. 1,2 on \u2192 off (after removing 0).\n\n8. 2 on \u2192 off (after removing 1).\n\n9. 3 on \u2192 off.\n\nSo, the only time the light was on was when 0,1,2 were all on. Then, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, it turned on. But when 2 was alone, it didn't. Also, removing 0 from 0,1,2 made it turn off. So perhaps the rule is that all three (0,1,2) must be present. But that seems unlikely because maybe other combinations could also work. Or maybe there's a specific combination. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly three objects, and among them at least one is a blicket. But when they put 3 on, which is one object, it didn't turn on. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, when they put 3 on the machine alone, the light was off. So the rule isn't just having any object on the machine. So maybe the rule is that the total weight or some other property of the blickets. But how to test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when the sum of the blicket's \"blicktness\" exceeds a threshold. For example, each blicket has a value, and the sum needs to be >= a certain number. Suppose 2 is a blicket with value 1. Then 0,1,2 sum to 1 (if 0 and 1 are not blickets). That's not enough. Wait, but then how does the light turn on? Unless multiple objects are blickets. Maybe 0 and 2 are blickets. Then sum is 2. But when 0 is alone, sum is 1, which may not meet the threshold. But when 0,1,2 are on, sum is 2 (assuming 0 and 2 are blickets, 1 is not). If the threshold is 2, then that would make the light turn on. Then when 2 is alone, sum is 1 \u2192 light off. When 0 and 2 are together, sum is 2 \u2192 light on. But in the steps, when 0 and 2 are on (after removing 1), does the light turn on? Let's see: after putting 0,1,2 on, light is on. Then remove 1 \u2192 machine has 0 and 2. If sum is 2 (threshold), the light should stay on. But according to the user's steps, after removing 0 (step 7), the light turns off. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, after putting 0,1,2 on (light on), then take 2 off (light off). Then put 2 back on (light on). Then take 0 off \u2192 machine has 1 and 2. Light off. Then take 1 off \u2192 machine has 2. Light off. So, when only 0 and 2 are on the machine, it's not tested. Wait, no. The user didn't test that scenario. So perhaps the rule requires exactly three blickets, but that seems unlikely since there are only 8 objects, and the user hasn't tested other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 is on it, regardless of others. But when 2 is alone, the light is off. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, but in step 5: after taking 2 off (0 and 1 on machine), light is off. Then putting 2 back on (0,1,2) \u2192 light on. Then taking 0 off (1 and 2 on machine) \u2192 light off. Taking 1 off (2 alone) \u2192 light off. So the light is only on when 0,1,2 are all on. That suggests that the rule requires all three to be present. But why would that be? Unless all three are blickets and the machine needs all of them. But if 0 and 1 are blickets, why does adding 2 (which may or may not be a blicket) activate it? Or maybe 0,1,2 are all blickets, and the machine requires all three to be present. But when they're all on, the light is on. But then, if any is missing, it's off. But when the user added 3 to the machine (alone), light was off, which is consistent if 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBut this would mean that the blickets are 0,1,2, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But there are 8 objects, and maybe others are also blickets. But the user hasn't tested other combinations yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are present. But without knowing which are blickets, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then having them together would activate it. But when 0 and 2 are on (without 1), does the light turn on? The user hasn't tested that yet. Let's see: the user added 0, then 1, then 2. Light on. Then removed 2 \u2192 light off. Then put 2 back \u2192 light on. Then removed 0 \u2192 light off (machine has 1 and 2). Then removed 1 \u2192 light off (machine has 2). Then added 3 \u2192 light off.\n\nSo, if the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed, and 0 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on the machine, the light should be on. But when the user removed 0 (step 7), leaving 1 and 2, the light was off. If 2 is a blicket but 1 isn't, then 1 and 2 would have one blicket, which doesn't meet the \"exactly two\" rule. But if the rule is \"at least two\", then having two blickets would work. But again, without knowing which are blickets, it's hard.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to test more combinations. For example, test putting 2 alone to see if it activates. Wait, according to the steps, after removing 0 and 1, leaving 2 on the machine, the light was off. So when 2 is alone, it's off. But when 0,1,2 are on, it's on. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least three objects are on it, and at least one of them is a blicket. But when they put 3 on alone (one object), it's off. But three objects (0,1,2) with at least one blicket would activate. But then, what if three non-blickets are on the machine? Would it activate? But the user hasn't tested that.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when the number of blickets is a multiple of three. But again, without knowing which are blickets, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is activated by a specific object, but only when combined with others. For example, object 2 is a blicket, but only if at least two other non-blickets are also present. But that seems too arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: the initial state had object 6 on the machine, and the light was off. So either 6 is not a blicket, or the rule requires more than just a single blicket.\n\nLet me consider possible rules and see which fit the observed data.\n\nPossible rule 1: The machine turns on if there's at least one blicket on it.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on, light is on. If any of them is a blicket, this would fit. But when 2 is alone, the light is off. So if 2 is a blicket, this contradicts the rule.\n\nPossible rule 2: The machine turns on only if exactly two blickets are present.\n\nBut then, when 0,1,2 are on (assuming two of them are blickets), light is on. But when one is removed, leaving two, it should stay on. But when the user removed 0 (leaving 1 and 2), light turned off. So that doesn't fit unless only one of 1 or 2 is a blicket.\n\nPossible rule 3: The machine turns on when all objects on it are blickets.\n\nIn that case, when 0,1,2 are on and light is on, all three must be blickets. Then removing any would leave non-blickets. But when the user added 3 alone, light was off, so 3 isn't a blicket. But when they put 2 alone, the light is off. If 2 is a blicket, then according to this rule, the machine should be on. But it's off. So contradiction.\n\nPossible rule 4: The machine turns on when the number of blickets is odd.\n\nIf 0,1,2 have an odd number of blickets (e.g., 1 or 3), then light is on. When 2 alone is on (assuming it's a blicket), number is 1 (odd), so light should be on. But according to the data, it's off. Contradiction.\n\nPossible rule 5: The machine turns on when the sum of blicket weights exceeds a threshold. For example, each blicket has weight 1, and sum >=3. Then having three blickets would turn it on. But when 0,1,2 are on (sum 3), light on. If two are blickets, sum 2 <3, light off. But without knowing which are blickets, hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly three blickets are present. If 0,1,2 are all blickets, then their sum is 3 \u2192 light on. Removing any would reduce to 2 \u2192 off. But when the user put 2 back alone (assuming it's a blicket), sum 1 \u2192 off. This fits. But then why when 0,1,2 are on, the sum is 3 \u2192 on. Then taking 0 off \u2192 sum 2 \u2192 off. Taking 1 off \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 off. This fits the data. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly three blickets are present. But then, the blickets would be 0,1,2. But how to confirm this? The user hasn't tested other combinations. For example, putting 0,1,2,3 on the machine. If the rule requires exactly three, then adding a fourth (non-blicket) would not change the count, so light remains on. Or if 3 is a blicket, then sum becomes 4 \u2192 off.\n\nBut according to the current data, when 3 was added alone, light was off. So 3 is not a blicket. So if 0,1,2 are all blickets, then putting them on would activate the machine. Any other combination would not.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested putting other triplets. For example, objects 4,5,6. But given the step limit, perhaps they need to infer based on current data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when object 2 is present along with at least two other objects. So the rule is that 2 is a blicket, and at least two other objects (regardless of being blickets) are also present. So when 0,1,2 are on \u2192 light on. When 2 is alone \u2192 off. When 2 and any two others are on \u2192 on. But in that case, putting 2 with 3 and 4 would also activate it. But the user hasn't tested that.\n\nBut according to the data, when 2 was added to 0 and 1 (which are not blickets), the light turned on. So if the rule is that 2 must be present with at least two others, then that's possible. But then, what makes 2 special? It would mean that 2 is a blicket and the rule requires it plus two others. But why would the others need to be there? Maybe the machine requires a quorum of three objects, one of which is a blicket. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven the current data, the most consistent rule seems to be that the machine turns on when exactly three blickets are present, and those blickets are objects 0,1,2. But this is a bit of a leap. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when object 2 is present along with any two other objects. In this case, 2 is the only blicket, and the machine requires two other objects (non-blickets) to be present. So:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 two non-blicks (0,1) and one blicket (2) \u2192 light on.\n- 2 alone \u2192 only one object \u2192 light off.\n- 2 plus one other \u2192 two objects \u2192 light off (needs three).\n- 2 plus two others \u2192 three objects \u2192 light on.\n\nBut why would the machine require three objects with 2 being a blicket? That seems possible, but how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when there's a blicket and the total number of objects on the machine is odd. For example, if 2 is a blicket, and when it's added with 0 and 1 (three objects, odd), the light turns on. If 2 is alone (one object, odd) but the machine requires the presence of a blicket, then light should be on. But according to the data, it's off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when the number of blickets is equal to the number of objects modulo something. Not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to test putting object 2 alone on the machine again to confirm. Because in the previous steps, after putting 2 back on (with 0 and 1), the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 caused the light to turn off. But when 2 was put on alone after that, the light was off. However, maybe there was a mistake in the previous steps. Let me check again:\n\nAfter taking 6 off, the user put 0, 1, then 2. Light turned on. Then took 2 off (light off). Then put 2 back (light on). Then took 0 off (light off). Took 1 off (light off). Then put 3 on (light off). So when 2 is alone, light is off. Therefore, the presence of 2 alone doesn't activate the machine, but when combined with 0 and 1, it does. This suggests that the rule requires 0,1, and 2 to all be present. But why? Unless they are all blickets and the rule requires all three. But then, if the user adds 0,1,2, and another object, does the light stay on? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the object numbers is a multiple of 3. Object 0+1+2=3 \u2192 yes. But object 3 alone is 3 \u2192 yes, but the light was off when 3 was added. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is based on the positions of the objects. But the user can't see that.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best hypothesis is that objects 0,1,2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are present. But earlier, when they were all present, the light was on. When any is removed, it's off. However, when the user added 3 alone, the light was off, which fits since 3 is not a blicket. But to confirm, the user should test other combinations, like putting 2 and 4 and 5 on the machine to see if the light turns on. But the user has limited steps. Alternatively, test putting 2 with any two other objects. For example, put 2,4,5 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is that 2 must be present with any two others. If not, then the rule requires 0,1,2.\n\nBut given the step limit, maybe the user should proceed with the current hypothesis.\n\nSo, based on the data:\n\n- 0,1,2 on \u2192 on.\n\n- Any subset of them \u2192 off.\n\n- Other objects alone \u2192 off.\n\nThus, the rule might be that the machine turns on when all three of 0,1,2 are present. Hence, they are all blickets. But this seems counterintuitive because individually they don't activate it, but together they do. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least three blickets are present. But we don't know if there are other blickets beyond 0,1,2.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of blickets modulo 3 equals zero. But again, without more data, it's hard.\n\nAnother possibility: The machine has a hidden condition where it requires a specific combination, like object 2 and at least two others. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the data, the safest bet is that objects 0,1,2 are blickets, and the rule is that all three must be on the machine. But to confirm, the user should try adding another object along with 2 to see if the light turns on. For example, put 2,4,5. If the light turns on, then the rule is that 2 plus any two others. If not, then the rule requires 0,1,2.\n\nBut since the user has limited steps, maybe they should test putting 2 with two other objects not in 0,1. Let's say 2,4,5. If the light turns on, then the rule is that 2 plus any two. If not, then the rule is 0,1,2.\n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. So, the next step should be to try adding 2 with other objects.\n\nIn the current state, after the last command, the machine has object 3 on it, which was added and the light is off. The user then took object 3 off. Now, the machine is empty. So the next step could be to put object 2 on the machine, then add two other objects (like 4 and 5) and see if the light turns on.\n\nBut the user has limited steps. Let me think about what's the most efficient way.\n\nCurrent objects on the machine: none.\n\nPrevious steps showed that putting 0,1,2 \u2192 on. 2 alone \u2192 off. So now, perhaps test 2 with two other objects, say 4 and 5.\n\nThe command would be:\n\nput object 2 on machine \u2192 light?\n\nThen put 4 \u2192 light?\n\nThen put 5 \u2192 light?\n\nIf the light turns on when 2,4,5 are on, then the rule is that 2 must be present with any two others. Then 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when 2 is present along with two other objects (regardless of them being blickets). In that case, the blicket is only 2, and the rule is having it plus two others.\n\nBut in the previous test, when 0,1,2 were on, light was on. If 2 plus any two others works, then that's the rule. But when the user took 0 off (leaving 1 and 2), the light turned off. Because there's only two objects. So the rule could be that the machine activates when there are at least three objects, and object 2 is among them. So 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine needs at least three objects including 2.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- 0,1,2 (three objects, includes 2) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2,4,5 (three objects, includes 2) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 alone (one object) \u2192 off.\n\n- 2 and 1 (two objects) \u2192 off.\n\n- 0,1,3,2 (four objects, includes 2) \u2192 on.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested these cases. So, to confirm, the next step should be to put 2,4,5 on the machine.\n\nSo, the next commands would be:\n\nput object 2 on machine \u2192 light off (since only one object).\n\nput object 4 on machine \u2192 light off (two objects).\n\nput object 5 on machine \u2192 if light turns on, then rule is three objects including 2.\n\nIf that's the case, then the blicket is 2, and the rule is that the machine activates when there are at least three objects, including 2.\n\nBut in the previous case, when the user added 3 alone, light was off. And when they added 0,1,2, light was on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 is present with at least two other objects, regardless of which they are.\n\nSo, the next step is to test this hypothesis. The user should put 2,4,5 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is that 2 must be present with two others. If not, then the rule is different.\n\nBut given that the user has limited steps, they need to decide.\n\nIn the current state, after the last action, the user took object 3 off the machine. The machine is empty.\n\nSo, the next step would be to put object 2 on the machine. Then add 4 and 5.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, put object 2 on machine \u2192 light? According to previous data, when 2 was put alone after removing 0 and 1, the light was off. So, putting 2 alone now should have light off.\n\nThen put object 4 on \u2192 still two objects, light off.\n\nThen put object 5 on \u2192 three objects, including 2. If light turns on, then the rule is that the machine activates when 2 is present with at least two others. If not, then the rule is different.\n\nBut this would take three steps. However, the user has already used 10 steps (including the initial ones). They have 32 steps, so there's time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can test with two objects first. Put 2 and 4 on. If light is off, then add 5.\n\nBut given the previous data, when 2 was alone, light off. When 2 plus two others (0,1,2), light on. So perhaps adding two others would work.\n\nBut in the current state, the machine is empty. So:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nAssuming the light is off (as before).\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 4 on machine\n\nStill off.\n\n> put object 5 on machine\n\nIf light turns on, then the rule is that 2 plus any two others.\n\nBut according to the previous data, when the user had 0,1,2 on, light was on. When they removed 0, leaving 1 and 2, light off. Then removed 1, leaving 2 alone, light off. So the number of objects matters. Therefore, the rule might be that the machine turns on when there are at least three objects on it, and at least one of them is a blicket (object 2). So, if there are three or more objects, and one of them is a blicket, then light on.\n\nBut then, putting 2 with 4 and 5 (three objects) should turn it on. But when they put 3 alone, it's off (correct, no blicket). When they put 0,1,2 (three objects, with 2 as a blicket), light on. When they put 2 alone (one object, less than three), light off. When they put 2 and 4 (two objects), light off. When they add 5 (three objects), light on.\n\nIf that's the case, then the rule is: the machine turns on when there are at least three objects on it and at least one of them is a blicket. The blicket would be object 2.\n\nBut then, when they put 2,4,5 on the machine, the light should turn on. If that's the case, then object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is as stated.\n\nAlternatively, if the machine requires exactly three objects with at least one blicket, then it would work.\n\nBut the user needs to test this.\n\nIn the current state, the machine is empty. So the next step is to put 2,4,5 on the machine.\n\nBut given the step limit, perhaps the user should proceed.\n\nSo, the next command would be:\n\nput object 2 on machine\n\nThen add 4 and 5.\n\nAssuming that the light turns on when three objects including 2 are present, then the rule is that.\n\nBut given the previous data, when 0,1,2 were on, light on. When 2 was alone, light off. When 1 and 2 were on (two objects), light off. When 2,4,5 are on (three objects), light on. Then the rule is that the machine activates when there are three or more objects and at least one of them is a blicket (object 2).\n\nIn that case, the blicket is object 2, and the rule is the machine turns on when at least three objects are on it, including at least one blicket.\n\nBut to confirm, the user would need to test other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires a quorum of three objects, and one of them must be a blicket.\n\nBut again, without testing, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly three objects, and object 2 is among them. So, the rule is that object 2 must be present with exactly two others. Then the blicket is 2, and the rule is having 2 plus two others.\n\nIn that case, adding 2,4,5 should turn it on. Adding 2,4,5,6 would still have 2 plus three others, but the light might stay on or turn off, depending on the rule.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested that.\n\nGiven the current data, the safest assumption is that object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when there are at least three objects, including object 2. Thus, the blickets are object 2, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least three objects are on it, including object 2.\n\nBut let's see what the user should do next. They need to find out. So the next logical step is to test putting 2 with two other objects not previously used (like 4 and 5).\n\nSo, the commands would be:\n\nput object 2 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nput object 4 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nput object 5 on machine \u2192 light on.\n\nIf that's the case, then the rule is confirmed. But if the light doesn't turn on, then the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 is present with objects 0 and 1. Which would make 0,1,2 all blickets. But that seems unlikely, as the user would need to test other combinations.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the user should proceed to infer based on existing data.\n\nGiven that adding 0,1,2 turns it on, and any of them removed turns it off, it's possible that all three are blickets and the rule requires all three to be present. But when they added 3 alone, it's off, so 3 isn't a blicket.\n\nBut why would the machine require all three to be present? That would mean the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there are more blickets, like 4, then adding them would require those too. But the user hasn't tested that.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it activates when a specific set of objects are present. In this case, 0,1,2.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested other combinations. For example, adding 2,0,4. Would that activate the machine?\n\nGiven the uncertainty, the best approach is to conclude that objects 0,1,2 are blickets, and the rule is that all three must be present on the machine. But this is based on the observed data where their collective presence activates the machine, and any absence deactivates it. However, this is a bit of a leap, as there might be other combinations. But given the data, this seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when it's present with at least two other objects. Which would mean the blicket is 2, and the rule is three or more objects with 2.\n\nBut to confirm, the user should test this. Given the step limit, they should proceed to test putting 2 with two other objects.\n\nSo, the next command would be to put object 2 on the machine, then 4 and 5.\n\nBut the user's next command should be to put object 2 on the machine again to see if it alone activates it. But previous steps showed that when 2 was alone, the light was off. So putting it alone again would just confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want to test another combination. For example, put 2 and 0 on the machine. Then add another object.\n\nBut given the previous data, when 0 and 2 were on with 1, it worked. When 0 and 2 were on without 1, it didn't. So maybe the rule requires 0,1,2 together.\n\nBut given the steps left, the user might need to make a educated guess.\n\nBased on the data, the most plausible answer is that object 2 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But this contradicts the step where 2 alone was on and the light was off.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires that exactly one blicket is present. But when 0,1,2 are on (assuming 2 is a blicket), light is on. But if only 2 is on, light should be on. But it's off.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps there's a different rule, such as the machine turns on when the sum of the blicket's IDs equals a certain value. For example, object 2's ID is 2, which might be part of a sum. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the step limit, I'll proceed to hypothesize that objects 0,1,2 are blickets, and the rule is that all three must be present on the machine. Therefore, the next step would be to exit the game and report this. But to confirm, the user should test putting another triplet, like 0,1,2 again. But that's already been done.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when there's a blicket and the total number of objects is even. When 0,1,2 are on (three objects, odd), but light was on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI think I need to make a decision based on the available data. The only time the light turned on was when 0,1,2 were all present. Removing any of them turned it off. So the rule is likely that all three must be present, and they are the blickets. Hence, the answer is blickets are 0,1,2 and the rule is that all must be on the machine.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the machine requires an odd number of blickets, and 2 is the only blicket. So when 0,1,2 are on (one blicket), light on. But when 2 is alone (one blicket), light off. Which contradicts. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it activates when exactly two blickets are present, and 0 and 2 are blickets. So when 0 and 2 are present with a non-blicket (1), the sum is two blickets. But when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2 (one blicket), light off. But when 0,1,2 are on (two blickets), light on. But this would require that 1 is a non-blicket and 0 and 2 are blickets. Then, when 0,1,2 are on, sum is two \u2192 light on. When 2 is alone \u2192 one \u2192 off. When 0 and 2 are on \u2192 two \u2192 on. But according to the data, when the user removed 0 from the group (leaving 1 and 2), the light turned off. So if 2 is a blicket and 1 is not, then 1 and 2 would be one blicket \u2192 light off. But if the rule requires two, that fits. But when the user added 2 back alone (step 5), light was on. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nStep 5: after removing 2, light off. Then put 2 back \u2192 light on. At that point, machine has 0,1,2 \u2192 sum two blickets (0 and 2), light on. Then remove 0 \u2192 sum one blicket (2), light off. Remove 1 \u2192 sum one (2), light off. So that fits if the rule is exactly two blickets. Thus, blickets are 0 and 2. But when 0 was on alone, light was off. So 0 is a blicket, but alone (sum one) doesn't activate. But when 0 and 2 are together (sum two), light on. But in the step where 0,1,2 are on, sum is two \u2192 on. Then when 0 is removed, sum is one \u2192 off. But when 2 is alone, sum one \u2192 off. So this fits if the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. Hence, blickets are 0 and 2.\n\nBut why did putting 0 and 1 on the machine (step 2 and 3) not activate it? Because 0 is a blicket, and 1 is not. Sum is one \u2192 light off. Adding 2 (also a blicket) \u2192 sum two \u2192 light on. Then removing 2 \u2192 sum one \u2192 off. Then adding 2 again \u2192 sum two \u2192 on. Then removing 0 \u2192 sum one \u2192 off. So this fits. But then, why when the user put 0 on alone, the light was off. Because sum is one \u2192 rule requires exactly two. So the blickets would be 0 and 2. But then, the machine should turn on when both are present. For example, putting 0 and 2 on the machine. But the user hasn't tested that scenario. According to the data, when the user removed 0 from 0,1,2 (leaving 1 and 2), sum is one (2 is a blicket) \u2192 light off. But if the rule is exactly two, then 0 and 2 together should activate it. But the user hasn't tested that.\n\nSo, the user should test putting 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is exactly two blickets. If not, then something else.\n\nBut given the steps left, the user needs to act. The next command could be to put 0 and 2 on the machine to see.\n\nIn the current state, the machine is empty. So the commands would be:\n\nput object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nput object 2 on machine \u2192 sum two blickets \u2192 light on.\n\nIf this happens, then the rule is exactly two blickets. But according to the previous data, when 0 and 2 were on with 1 (sum two blickets), light on. But when 0 and 2 are on alone (sum two), light on. But in the data, when the user took 0 off after having 0,1,2 on, leaving 1 and 2, the light turned off. Because sum is one (2 is a blicket). But if 0 and 2 are both blickets, then putting them together should activate the machine.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested this. So, the next logical step is to test putting 0 and 2 on the machine.\n\nSo, the next commands would be:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf light turns on, then rule is exactly two blickets.\n\nBut according to previous steps, when the user put 0, then 1, then 2, the light turned on when 2 was added (sum two blickets). Then, when they removed 2, light off. When they added 2 back, light on (sum two). Then removed 0, sum one \u2192 off.\n\nBut according to this, 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is exactly two.\n\nBut when 0 and 2 are on the machine, the light should be on. But according to the previous steps, when the user had 0 and 2 on the machine (after removing 1), the light was off. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on (light on), then taking 1 off (leaving 0 and 2), the light should turn off if the rule is exactly two. But according to the data, when the user took 0 off (after having 0,1,2 on), the light turned off. Wait, the steps were:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on (light on), user took 0 off \u2192 light off (machine has 1 and 2). If 0 and 2 are blickets, then sum is one (only 2) \u2192 light off. Which fits the rule of exactly two. But when 0 and 2 are on the machine, sum is two \u2192 light should be on. But the user hasn't tested that scenario.\n\nSo, to test this, the user should put 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is exactly two. If not, then something else.\n\nGiven the current state (machine empty), the next step is:\n\n> put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n> put object 2 on machine \u2192 if light on, then rule is exactly two blickets (0 and 2).\n\nBut according to previous data, when the user added 0 and 1 (sum one), light off. Adding 2 (sum two) \u2192 light on. So yes, if 0 and 2 are blickets, then putting them together should activate the machine. But when the user removed 0 from 0,1,2, leaving 1 and 2 (sum one), light off. Then removing 1, leaving 2 alone (sum one), light off. So, the only time the light was on is when 0 and 2 are both present. Thus, the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present, and the blickets are 0 and 2.\n\nBut in that case, when the user puts 0 and 2 on the machine, the light should turn on. But according to the previous steps, after putting 0 and 1, then adding 2, the light turned on. Then, if they remove 1, leaving 0 and 2, the light should stay on. But in the user's steps, after removing 0 (from 0,1,2), the light turned off (machine has 1 and 2). Then removing 1 (leaving 2 alone), light off. So, when 0 and 2 are on the machine, the light should be on. But the user hasn't tested that exact scenario.\n\nThus, the next step should be to test that. The user should put 0 and 2 on the machine.\n\nSo, current state: machine is empty.\n\nCommand: put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nCommand: put object 2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n\nIf that's the case, then the rule is exactly two blickets, and the blickets are 0 and 2. But according to previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on (sum one), light off. Adding 2 (sum two) \u2192 light on. Removing 0 \u2192 sum one \u2192 off. Adding 0 back \u2192 sum two \u2192 on.\n\nBut in the user's steps, after putting 0,1,2 on (light on), taking 0 off \u2192 light off. Which fits if sum becomes one. Then putting 0 back \u2192 sum two \u2192 light on. But the user didn't test that. Instead, after taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2), light off. Then took 1 off (leaving 2), light off. Then put 3 on, light off.\n\nSo, the user's data suggests that the light is only on when 0,1,2 are all present. Which would imply all three are blickets. But that's conflicting with the previous assumption. \n\nI think I'm going in circles here. To proceed, I'll make a decision based on the data.\n\nThe light turns on only when 0,1,2 are all present. Thus, the rule is that all three must be on the machine, and they are all blickets. Therefore, the blickets are 0,1,2, and the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are present.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the sum of their IDs modulo 3 equals 0. 0+1+2=3 \u2192 3 mod 3=0 \u2192 light on. But adding 3 alone (3 mod 3=0) would turn it on, but the user's step showed it's off. So that's not it.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the blickets are 0,1,2, and the rule is that all three must be present on the machine. Hence, the next command would be to exit the game and report this. But since the user hasn't tested all possibilities, there's a risk of error. But based on the available data, this seems the most plausible."}

So, the machine turns on when certain objects (blickets) are placed on it. The goal is to find out which ones are blickets and the rule that makes the machine activate.\n\nFrom the previous interactions, when objects 0, 1, and 2 were placed on the machine, the light turned on only after adding object 2. Then, removing 0 and 1 didn't turn it off until object 2 was removed. Wait, no\u2014when they put object 0, 1, and 2 on the machine, the light was off until object 2 was added. Then, after removing 0 and 1, leaving only 2, the machine stayed on when they put 2 back. Wait, no, let me check the steps again.\n\nThe user first took object 6 off the machine. Then added 0, 1, 2. The light turned on when 2 was added. Then taking 2 off turned it off. Adding 2 back turned it on again. Then removing 0 and 1 didn't affect the light until 2 was removed. Wait, no, after adding 0,1,2, light on. Then removing 2 turns it off. Then adding 2 again turns it on. Then removing 0 and 1, the light stays on? Because when they took 0 and 1 off, the machine was still on? Or did taking 0 off turn it off?\n\nWait, let me retrace the steps:\n\n1. Initially, object 6 was on the machine, others on the floor. User takes 6 off. Now all objects are on the floor except none on machine.\n\n2. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n\n3. Put 1 on machine: light off.\n\n4. Put 2 on machine: light turns on.\n\nSo with 0,1,2 on machine, light is on.\n\nThen take 2 off: light off.\n\nPut 2 back: light on (so machine has 0,1,2 again? Or just 2? Wait, after taking 2 off, the machine has 0 and 1. Then putting 2 back on, so now 0,1,2 are on machine, light on. Then user takes 0 and 1 off. So machine has only 2. Then light turns off? Because when they took 0 off, the light stayed on? Let me check the actual commands:\n\nAfter putting 2 back on machine, the light is on. Then:\n\n> take object 0 off machine: light turns off? Because after taking 0 off, the machine has 1 and 2. But the light was on before taking 0 off. Wait, the user took 0 off, and the light is off. Wait, no. Let me check the exact outputs:\n\nAfter putting 2 on machine (third time), the machine's light is on. Then:\n\n> take object 0 off machine: light turns off? Because the output says \"You took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\" So after removing 0, with 1 and 2 still on the machine, the light is off. Then taking 1 off leaves only 2 on the floor. Then putting 3 on machine: light off. Then taking 3 off. Then trying to put 2 back on, but it's already on the machine (wait, after taking 0 and 1 off, machine is empty except 2 was put back on? Wait, let's go step by step.\n\nOriginal steps after initial setup:\n\n1. take object 6 off machine: machine is empty.\n\n2. put 0 on machine: machine has 0. Light off.\n\n3. put 1 on machine: machine has 0,1. Light off.\n\n4. put 2 on machine: machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\n5. take 2 off: machine has 0,1. Light off.\n\n6. put 2 back on: machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\n7. take 0 off: machine has 1,2. Light turns off.\n\n8. take 1 off: machine has 2. Light remains off.\n\nThen they put 3 on machine (now 2 and 3 on machine). Light off. Then take 3 off. Then try to put 2 on machine again, but it's already there. Wait, after step 8, machine has object 2. Then when they tried to put 2 on machine again, it's already there. So the machine has 2, but light is off. So that suggests that object 2 alone is not enough to activate the machine. But earlier, when 0,1,2 were on, it was on. Then when 2 was removed, it turned off. Then putting 2 back (with 0 and 1 still on) turned it on. Then removing 0 caused the light to turn off, even though 1 and 2 were still on. Then removing 1 left only 2, which didn't turn it on.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's try to list the states:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on machine: light on.\n\n- Take 2 off: 0 and 1 remain. Light off.\n\n- Put 2 back: 0,1,2 again. Light on.\n\n- Take 0 off: 1 and 2 remain. Light off.\n\nSo with 1 and 2 on, light is off. Then take 1 off, leaving 2 alone: light still off. Then adding 3: 2 and 3, light off. So that suggests that 2 alone isn't enough, nor 2 with 3.\n\nBut when 0,1,2 were all on, the light was on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least three objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But then when they put 0,1,2, it's three objects. Then taking one off (0) leaves two, which turns it off. So that's possible. But then when they tried to put 2 on again, but it's already there, maybe they thought adding more. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of some property (like each blicket contributes 1, and the machine needs total >= 3). But in that case, maybe 0,1,2 are all blickets, so sum is 3. Then removing 0 (sum 2) turns it off. But when they took 0 off, leaving 1 and 2, which would sum to 2 if both are blickets. But the light turned off. So that would mean the rule is sum >=3. So 0,1,2 are all blickets. But when they added 3, which might not be a blicket, then sum remains 2 (1,2,3: assuming 3 is not a blicket). But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So if 0,1,2 are blickets, and the machine requires all of them to be on. But that doesn't fit because when 2 was removed, the machine turned off, but adding it back turned it on again. So if all three are required, then yes. But then when 0 was removed, leaving 1 and 2, the machine turns off, which fits. But then, if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, how many are there? If 0,1,2 are all blickets, then yes. But how do we know? Because when they added 0,1,2, the machine turned on. Then removing any one of them turned it off. So that suggests that all three are required. But the user later tried putting 2 alone on the machine, and it didn't turn on. So if the rule is that all three (0,1,2) must be on, then that's the case.\n\nBut let's check other possibilities. Maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. But when they had 0 and 1 on, no light. Adding 2 made it three, and the light turned on. But then removing 0 and 1 leaves 2, which doesn't activate it. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when there's at least one blicket, but only if placed in a certain way. But when 0 and 1 were on, no activation. Adding 2 (a blicket) turned it on. But then removing 0 and 1 (non-blickets) but keeping 2 (blicket) should keep it on. But in the steps, after taking 0 and 1 off, leaving 2 on, the light turned off. So that contradicts that. Unless 0 and 1 are also blickets. Wait, let's re-examine:\n\nWhen 0,1,2 are on the machine, light is on. If all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present, then removing any would turn it off. But if the rule is that the sum of their blicktness is >=3, and each blicket contributes 1, then 0+1+2=3. If they are all blickets, then removing one reduces the sum to 2, which is below threshold. That fits the observed behavior.\n\nBut then, when the user tried putting 3 on the machine (with 2 already there), the light didn't turn on. So if 3 is not a blicket, sum is 1 (only 2 is a blicket). So sum is 1, which is below 3. So that fits.\n\nSo possible rule: the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is at least 3. Then, the blickets must be 0,1,2, because adding them all gives sum 3, activating the machine. Removing any one reduces the sum to 2, deactivating. Putting 2 alone (sum 1) doesn't work. Putting 3 (non-blicket) with 2 (sum 1) also doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that exactly three blickets are present. But that would mean that adding a fourth blicket would turn it off, which we haven't tested.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly three blickets, but the user hasn't tested adding more. But based on current info, the most plausible is that the sum of blickets on the machine must be >=3. Therefore, objects 0,1,2 are blickets. Let's see if there's any other possibilities.\n\nWait, when the user put 2 on the machine alone (after removing 0 and 1), the light was off. So if 2 is a blicket, but sum is 1, which is less than 3. So the rule requires at least 3. Thus, 0,1,2 must all be blickets. Then, adding all three gives sum 3, which activates. Removing any one reduces the sum to 2, deactivating. That fits the observations.\n\nBut what about object 6? Initially, it was on the machine. But when they took it off, the machine was off. Then adding 0,1,2 turned it on. So 6 is not a blicket, because having 6 alone didn't activate the machine (since the light was off when they took it off, but maybe 6 was a blicket and the machine was on before they took it off? Wait, initially, object 6 was on the machine. The initial state says the machine's light was off. So even with 6 on the machine, the light was off. Therefore, 6 is not a blicket. So 0,1,2 are the only blickets.\n\nAnother possibility: the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. But that doesn't fit because when 0 and 1 were on (assuming they are not blickets), adding 2 (a blicket) made it three, which might not fit. Wait, maybe 2 is a blicket and 0 and 1 are not. Then adding 2 alone would make one blicket, which if the rule is at least one, the light should be on. But in the steps, when 0 and 1 were on (non-blickets) and then adding 2 (blicket), the light turned on. That would fit if the rule is at least one. But then, after removing 0 and 1 (non-blickets), leaving 2 (blicket), the light should stay on. But in the steps, after removing 0 and 1, the machine's light turned off. That contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. If 0 and 2 are blickets, but 1 is not. Then when 0 and 1 and 2 are on the machine, the count is two (0 and 2), which would activate. But when removing 0, leaving 1 and 2 (count 1), light turns off. Then putting 2 back (count 1) doesn't help. But this doesn't fit the steps. Because when 0 and 1 and 2 are on, the count is two (if 0 and 2 are blickets), but the light turns on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 (count 1), light off. Then putting 2 back (but it was already there). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets. But again, not sure.\n\nThe most consistent explanation so far is that the machine turns on when at least three blickets are on it, and 0,1,2 are blickets. Because when they were all on, the light was on. Removing any one reduces the count to two, which is below three, turning it off. Then putting 2 back (with 0 and 1 still there) brings the count back to three. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves 2 (count 1), which is not enough. Adding 3 (non-blicket) doesn't help. So that fits.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis. If 0,1,2 are blickets, then putting all three on should activate. Putting any subset of two or fewer should not. Let's check:\n\n- 0,1,2 on: sum 3 \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,1 on: sum 2 \u2192 off.\n\n- 0,2 on: sum 2 \u2192 off.\n\n- 1,2 on: sum 2 \u2192 off.\n\n- 2 alone: sum 1 \u2192 off.\n\nSo when the user took 0 off (leaving 1 and 2), the sum was 2 \u2192 off. Then took 1 off, leaving 2 (sum 1) \u2192 off. Then put 3 on (2 and 3 \u2192 sum 1) \u2192 off. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that the machine turns on when at least three blickets are on it. And the blickets are 0,1,2.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: the machine requires all blickets to be present. Suppose there are three blickets (0,1,2). Then the machine requires all three to be on. So removing any one turns it off. That also fits the observations. For example, when 0,1,2 are on, it's on. Remove 0 \u2192 off. Put 0 back \u2192 on. But in this scenario, the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So if there are exactly three blickets (0,1,2), then the machine requires all of them to be present.\n\nIn this case, even if there are other blickets, but the user hasn't found them, but in this scenario, the user has only found 0,1,2 as the ones that matter. Let's see.\n\nWait, in the initial steps, the user added 0,1,2, and the machine turned on. Then removing 0 turned it off, even though 1 and 2 were still on. So if the rule is that all blickets must be present, then 0,1,2 must all be blickets. Because removing any one of them turns the machine off. So in that case, the rule is \"all blickets must be on the machine\". But how do we know there aren't more blickets?\n\nFor example, if there are four blickets (0,1,2,3), then the machine would require all four to be on. But in the steps, when 0,1,2 were on, the machine was on. But if 3 is also a blicket, then the machine should be off unless all four are on. But in the steps, when 3 was added (after 2 was on), the machine remained off. So that suggests 3 is not a blicket. So the rule must be that the machine requires all blickets to be present, and the blickets are 0,1,2.\n\nAlternatively, the machine could require exactly three blickets, but they can be any combination. But that doesn't fit because putting 2 alone didn't activate.\n\nHmm. The two possible rules are:\n\n1. The machine activates when all blickets are on it. The blickets are 0,1,2.\n\n2. The machine activates when at least three blickets are on it. The blickets are 0,1,2.\n\nHow to distinguish between these two? If there are more than three blickets, but based on the user's experiments, adding 3 didn't activate the machine. So 3 is not a blicket. Similarly, objects 4,5,7 haven't been tested.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested other combinations. For example, putting 0,1,2,3 on the machine. If rule 1 (all blickets must be on), and 3 is not a blicket, then adding 3 wouldn't affect. But if the rule is at least three, adding 3 (non-blicket) would still have sum 3, so machine stays on. But the user hasn't done that.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the initial steps:\n\nWhen 0,1,2 were on, machine on. Then removing 2 \u2192 off. Adding 2 back \u2192 on. Then removing 0 \u2192 off. So that suggests that all three are needed. So rule 1: all blickets must be present. Because if any one is missing, it turns off. So the blickets are 0,1,2, and the rule is that all must be on the machine.\n\nBut how do we know there aren't more blickets? For example, if there's a fourth blicket (say, 4), then the machine would require 0,1,2,4. But the user hasn't tested that. However, since the user hasn't encountered a case where the machine is on with 0,1,2 and another object, maybe it's safe to assume that 0,1,2 are the only blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly three blickets are on it. Then, the three blickets could be 0,1,2. Adding any other object (non-blicket) wouldn't change the count. But in this case, if the user adds 3 (non-blicket) to the machine with 0,1,2, the count remains three, so the machine stays on. But the user hasn't tested that.\n\nBut in the steps, when the user put 3 on the machine (after having 2 and 3), the light was off. But that's because 2 was alone. Wait, after taking 0 and 1 off, machine had 2. Then putting 3 on: machine has 2 and 3. Light off. So if 2 is a blicket and 3 is not, sum is 1, which doesn't meet the threshold. So that supports the 'at least three' rule.\n\nBut without testing other combinations, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the available information, the most consistent explanation is that the machine requires all three blickets (0,1,2) to be present. Because removing any one of them turns it off. So the rule is \"all blickets must be on the machine\", and the blickets are 0,1,2.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that exactly three blickets are needed, regardless of which ones, then having any three blickets would activate. But since putting 2 alone didn't work, but maybe other combinations. But the user hasn't tested other combinations. So this is less likely.\n\nAnother test the user could do is put 2,4,5 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is at least three, and 4 and 5 are blickets. But since the user hasn't done that, we can't know. But based on current data, the best guess is that 0,1,2 are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present.\n\nBut wait, when the user added 0,1,2, the light turned on. Then removing 0 caused it to turn off, even though 1 and 2 were still there. That suggests that all three are required. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 0,1,2.\n\nThus, the answer would be blickets are 0,1,2, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps the user should test other combinations. For example, put 0,2, and another object (say 4) on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is at least three. If not, then it's all three specific ones.\n\nBut given the steps taken, the user hasn't done that. So based on the available info, the conclusion is 0,1,2 are blickets, rule is all must be on."}

So the goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets somehow activate the machine, but I need to determine the hidden rule.\n\nLooking at the previous interactions, when object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. Then when objects 0, 1, and 2 were all on the machine, the light was on. But when 0 and 1 were removed, leaving only 2, the light stayed on. Then when 2 was removed, the light went off. So maybe object 2 is a blicket. But earlier, when only 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. That suggests that 2 is a blicket and the others aren't. But wait, when they put 2 on again alone, the light turned on. Then after taking 0 and 1 off, putting 2 back on made the light come on again. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But then why did the light turn off when 0 and 1 were taken off while 2 was still on? Wait, no, in the steps:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on machine, light is on. Then take 2 off, light goes off. Then put 2 back, light on. Then take 0 and 1 off, leaving 2 on. Light was on. Then take 2 off, light off. Then put 2 on again, light on. Then when they tried putting 3, 4 on, light stays off. So that suggests that object 2 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. But then why when object 2 was placed alone the first time (after taking off 0 and 1), the light went off? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial state had object 6 on the machine, then they took it off. Then added 0,1,2. Then adding 2 made the light on. Then took 2 off, light off. Then put 2 back, light on. Then took 0 and 1 off, which would leave 2 on the machine. The light was on. Then when they took 2 off, light off. Then put 2 on again, light on. Then tried 3 and 4, which didn't activate. So that seems consistent with object 2 being a blicket. The machine turns on if there's at least one blicket on it. So when 2 is on, light is on. So why did the light turn off when 0 and 1 were taken off but 2 was still on? Wait, let me check the exact steps:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on, the light is on. Then take 2 off: light off. Then put 2 back: light on. Then take 0 and 1 off: the machine now has only 2. The light should stay on, right? But according to the log:\n\nAfter taking 0 off: \"took object 0 off, light is off\". Then taking 1 off: \"took 1 off, light is off\". Wait, but if 2 was still on the machine after taking 0 and 1 off, why did the light go off? That contradicts the earlier result where putting 2 alone made the light on. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nLet me reconstruct the steps step by step:\n\n1. Initially, object 6 is on the machine. They take it off. Now machine is empty. Light off.\n\n2. Put 0 on machine. Light off.\n\n3. Put 1 on machine. Light off.\n\n4. Put 2 on machine. Light turns on.\n\nSo with 0,1,2 on machine, light is on.\n\n5. Take 2 off. Light turns off. So machine has 0 and 1. Light off.\n\n6. Put 2 back on. Now machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\n7. Take 0 off. Now machine has 1 and 2. Light... according to the log, after taking 0 off, light is off. Wait, but if 2 is a blicket, removing 0 shouldn't affect it. So machine has 1 and 2. If 2 is a blicket, light should stay on. But according to the log, after taking 0 off, light is off. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, the log says:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on, light is on.\n\nThen take 2 off: light off.\n\nThen put 2 back on: light on.\n\nThen take 0 off: \"You took object 0 off. The light on the machine is currently off.\"\n\nSo after taking 0 off, leaving 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is off. That's unexpected if 2 is a blicket. So maybe the rule isn't just having at least one blicket. Maybe there's a different rule. Like the machine requires exactly two blickets, or an odd number, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when the total number of blickets is even, or some other combination. Let me think.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the machine requires that all objects on it are blickets. So if even one non-blicket is present, it doesn't activate. But in the case where 0,1,2 are on, and the light is on, that would mean 0,1,2 are all blickets. But when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2, the light goes off. That would suggest that 1 is not a blicket. Wait, but then why did adding 2 make the light on when 0 and 1 were already on? Unless 2 is a blicket and 0 and 1 are not. Wait, when 0 and 1 were on, light off. Adding 2 made it on. Then taking 2 off, light off. So 2 is a blicket. Then putting 2 back, light on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) and 1 (non-blicket) leaves only 2 (blicket) on the machine, so the light should stay on. But according to the log, after taking 0 off, the light is off. That's a problem. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on, the light is on. Then take 2 off, light off. Then put 2 back, light on. Then take 0 off: light off. So with 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is off. But when 2 was put on alone earlier, the light was on. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, when they first put 0 on, then 1, then 2, the light turned on. Then they took 2 off, leaving 0 and 1, and the light went off. Then put 2 back on (so 0,1,2), light on. Then take 0 off, leaving 1 and 2. Light off. Then take 1 off, leaving 2. Light off? But earlier, when they took 0 and 1 off after putting 2 back, the machine had only 2 on it, and the light was on. Wait, no. Let me check the exact log:\n\nAfter taking 0 off (step 7):\n\n\"You took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\"\n\nThen step 8: take 1 off. \"You took object 1 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\"\n\nSo after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine has only 2 on it. But the light is off. But earlier, when they put 2 back on after removing it (step 6: put 2 on machine again), the light turned on. Wait, but after step 6, the machine had 0,1,2. Then they took 0 off (step 7), so machine has 1 and 2. Light off. Then took 1 off (step 8), machine has only 2. Light remains off. But earlier, when they put 2 on the machine alone (after taking 0 and 1 off), the light came on. Wait, no. Let me check the exact steps again:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. take object 6 off machine (now machine is empty)\n\n2. put object 0 on machine (light off)\n\n3. put object 1 on machine (light off)\n\n4. put object 2 on machine (light turns on)\n\n5. take object 2 off (light off)\n\n6. put object 2 on machine (light on again, machine has 0,1,2)\n\n7. take object 0 off (machine has 1,2; light off)\n\n8. take object 1 off (machine has 2; light off)\n\n9. put object 3 on machine (machine has 2,3; light off)\n\n10. take 3 off (machine has 2; light off)\n\n11. put object 2 on machine (already on, so no change; light off)\n\n12. put object 4 on machine (machine has 2,4; light off)\n\nSo after step 6, machine has 0,1,2 and light is on. Then step 7: take 0 off, leaving 1 and 2. Light is off. Then step 8: take 1 off, leaving 2. Light still off. Then step 11: trying to put 2 on again (but it's already there). Then step 12: put 4 on. Light remains off.\n\nSo this is confusing. Because when 2 was added to 0 and 1 (steps 2-4), the light turned on. Then when 2 was removed (step5), light off. Then adding 2 back (step6) made light on again. But when 0 is removed (step7), leaving 1 and 2, light off. Then removing 1 (step8), leaving 2 alone, light still off. But earlier, when 2 was added alone (after step6?), no. Wait, no. Let me retrace:\n\nAfter step6, machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nStep7: take 0 off. Now machine has 1 and 2. Light off.\n\nStep8: take 1 off. Now machine has 2. Light off.\n\nBut earlier, in step4, adding 2 to 0 and 1 turned the light on. Then in step6, adding 2 again (after removing it in step5) turned the light on again. But then, after removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, the light is off. That's inconsistent. Unless there's a different rule. Maybe the machine requires that the number of blickets is odd. But then, if 2 is a blicket, having one would turn it on. But when 2 is alone, it's off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. When 0,1,2 are on, maybe two of them are blickets. But when 0 is removed (step7), leaving 1 and 2, maybe only one is a blicket (2), so the light turns off. Then when both 1 and 2 are on, maybe that's two blickets. Wait, but step4: adding 2 to 0 and 1 made the light on. So if 0 and 1 are not blickets, adding 2 (a blicket) would make one blicket. But that would not satisfy a 'exactly two' rule. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the sum of blickets is a multiple of 3. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates only when all objects on it are blickets. So if any non-blicket is present, it doesn't activate. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn step4: objects 0,1,2 are on the machine. Light on. So according to this rule, all three must be blickets. Then when 2 is removed (step5), leaving 0 and 1. If 0 and 1 are blickets, the machine should stay on. But the light turns off. So that contradicts.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates if there is at least one blicket, but only if it's the only object on the machine. So when 2 is alone, it's on. But when 2 is with others, it's off. But in step4, 0,1,2 are on and light is on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the machine's state depends on the combination of objects. Maybe the presence of object 2 with certain others activates it. For example, maybe object 2 and object 0 together. But when 0 and 2 were on (after step7?), no, because after step7, machine has 1 and 2, and light is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that object 2 is a blicket, and at least one other object (non-blicket) is also on the machine. So when 2 is alone, it's off. But when 2 is with others, it's on. Let's see:\n\nIn step4: 0,1,2 are on. Light on. If 2 is a blicket and 0 and 1 are non-blickets, then the rule would require that a blicket is present along with others. So light on. When 2 is removed (step5), light off. Then adding 2 back (step6), light on. Then removing 0 (step7) leaves 1 and 2. So a blicket (2) and a non-blicket (1). The rule would require at least one blicket and at least one other object. So light should be on. But according to the log, it's off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. Let's test that.\n\nIn step4: 0,1,2 on. If 2 is the only blicket, then one blicket. Light on. Then take 2 off (step5), light off. Add 2 back (step6), light on. Then take 0 off (step7): machine has 1 and 2. If 2 is a blicket and 1 is not, then exactly one blicket. Light should stay on. But according to log, light is off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets. If 2 is a blicket, then when it's alone (odd), light off. But in step4, with 0,1,2 (assuming 2 is a blicket), one blicket (odd), light on. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the number of blickets is greater than or equal to 2. But in step4, if only 2 is a blicket, then 1 blicket, light on. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different. Maybe the machine activates when the total weight of blickets is more than non-blickets. But that seems complicated without knowing weights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it activates when a specific combination of objects is present. For example, 2 and 6. But 6 was initially on the machine but the light was off. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 is present along with any other object. So when 0,1,2 are on, light on. When 2 is alone, light off. But in step6, after adding 2 back (with 0 and 1), light on. Then taking 0 and 1 off leaves 2, light off. But earlier, when they took 2 off and put it back (steps5-6), light came on. Wait, but in that case, 0 and 1 were still on the machine. So the presence of 2 with others activates it. But when 2 is alone, it's off. But then, in step4, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, the light came on. Then removing 0 and 1, leaving 2 alone, light off. But then, when they put 2 back on the machine (step6), which already had 0 and 1, the light came on. Then taking 0 and 1 off (steps7-8), leaving 2, light off. Then putting 3 and 4 on with 2 (steps9-12), light remains off. So the rule could be that the machine activates when object 2 is present along with at least one other object. So 2 plus any other. But why would that be? Because 2 is a blicket, but requires another object to activate? But how does that fit with the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when object 2 is present. But that doesn't fit because when 2 is alone, the light is off (after steps7-8). Wait, no. Let me check the exact steps again.\n\nAfter step6: machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nStep7: take 0 off. Now machine has 1 and 2. Light off.\n\nStep8: take 1 off. Machine has 2. Light off.\n\nSo with 2 alone, light is off. But earlier, when 2 was added to 0 and 1 (step4), light turned on. Then when 2 was removed (step5), light off. Then adding 2 back (step6) made it on again. So perhaps the presence of 2 along with any two objects? But in step6, 0,1,2 are on. But then taking 0 off leaves 1 and 2. Light off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to test more scenarios. Let's see. Currently, after step12, the machine has objects 2 and 4 on it, and the light is off. So what if I take 4 off and put 2 back on? Wait, but 2 is already on. Or maybe take 4 off and see if the light comes on when only 2 is present. But according to previous steps, when 2 is alone, light is off. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is exactly two. Then, when 0,1,2 are on, and two of them are blickets, the light is on. But when one is removed, it turns off. But this requires figuring out which two. For example, maybe objects 2 and 1 are blickets. Then when 0,1,2 are on, two blickets, light on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 (two blickets), light should stay on. But according to the log, it turns off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when a specific object is present, regardless of others. Like object 2. But in that case, when 2 is on the machine, light should be on. But when 2 is alone, light is off. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe there's a timing aspect. Or maybe the machine's state isn't updated until after the command. Wait, no. The log shows the light's state after each command.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the machine requires that all objects on it are blickets. So if even one non-blicket is present, it doesn't activate. So when 0,1,2 are on, if all are blickets, light on. But then removing 0 (a blicket), leaving 1 and 2 (both blickets), light should stay on. But according to the log, it turns off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket and an even number of objects. Let's see:\n\n- Step4: 0,1,2 on (3 objects, odd). But light is on. If 2 is a blicket, then one blicket. So at least one and even number of objects. 3 is odd. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the number of blickets is odd. So:\n\n- 0,1,2 on, with 2 being the only blicket. Number of blickets is 1 (odd), light on.\n\n- Then remove 2, leaving 0 and 1. No blickets, even. Light off.\n\n- Add 2 back. Now 3 objects, 1 blicket (odd), light on.\n\n- Remove 0. Now 2 objects (1 and 2). If 2 is a blicket, number of blickets is 1 (odd). Light should stay on. But according to the log, it turns off. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. This is really tricky. Let's try to find a different approach. Let's list all the observations so far:\n\n1. Initially: object 6 on machine. Light off. After removing 6, light off.\n\n2. Put 0: light off.\n\n3. Put 1: light off.\n\n4. Put 2: light on.\n\n5. Remove 2: light off.\n\n6. Put 2 back: light on.\n\n7. Remove 0: light off (now machine has 1 and 2).\n\n8. Remove 1: light off (now machine has 2).\n\n9. Put 3: light off (machine has 2,3).\n\n10. Remove 3: light off (machine has 2).\n\n11. Put 2 again: no change (still off).\n\n12. Put 4: light off (machine has 2,4).\n\nSo the light was on only in steps 4 and 6 (when 0,1,2 were on, and then again when 2 was added back after removal). Then after removing 0, light off. Then after removing 1, light remains off even with 2 alone.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of 2 alone isn't sufficient. So maybe the rule requires a combination involving 2 and another object. Let's see:\n\nIn step4, 0,1,2 are on. Light on. If the rule is that 2 and either 0 or 1 must be present. But when 0 is removed (step7), leaving 1 and 2, light off. So that would require both 0 and 2. But then when 0 is removed, light goes off. But when 2 is added back (step6), which includes 0, light on. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. But then, in step4, when 0,1,2 are on, it's on. Then removing 0 (step7), light off. Adding 0 back would turn it on again. But that hasn't been tested yet. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that objects 2 and 6 are required, but 6 was taken off initially. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that exactly two specific objects are present. For example, 2 and 6. But 6 was on the machine initially and the light was off. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when the sum of the object numbers is even or odd. Let's check:\n\nIn step4: 0+1+2=3 (odd). Light on.\n\nAfter removing 0: 1+2=3 (odd). Light off. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum even. 0+1+2=3 (odd), light on. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 and at least two other objects are present. So in step4, three objects (including 2), light on. When 0 is removed (step7), two objects (1 and 2), light off. Then adding another object might turn it on. But when they added 3 (step9), machine has 2,3: two objects, light off. Then adding 4 (step12), three objects (2,4,3?), no. Wait, step12: after step11, machine has 2 (from step8, after step11: put 2 on, but it's already there, so still 2. Then put 4 on (step12), machine has 2 and 4. Light off. So three objects? No, two.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is based on the position of the objects. But the commands don't mention positions, only on or off the machine.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when the total number of blickets on it is exactly two. Let's see:\n\nIn step4: 0,1,2 are on. Suppose two of them are blickets. Light on. Then removing one of the blickets would leave one, light off. But which two are blickets? If 0 and 2, then removing 0 (step7) leaves 1 and 2. If 2 is a blicket, that's one, light off. That could fit. But why when adding 2 back (step6) to 0 and 1, which are non-blickets, would the light come on? Unless in that case, adding 2 makes two blickets (assuming 0 is a blicket). But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe objects 2 and 6 are blickets. Initially, 6 was on the machine but light was off. Then when 6 was removed, light off. Then adding 0,1,2, light on. So if 2 and 6 are blickets, but 6 was on initially and light was off. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another angle: when object 6 was initially on the machine, the light was off. Then after removing 6 and adding 0,1,2, light came on. So 6 is not a blicket. 2 is a candidate. But then why does the light turn off when 2 is alone?\n\nMaybe the machine's rule is that it activates when there's at least one blicket and no non-blickets. But that would mean all objects on the machine must be blickets. So when 0,1,2 are on, and if all are blickets, light on. Then removing 0 (a blicket), leaves 1 and 2 (also blickets), light should stay on. But according to the log, it turns off. Contradiction.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to test more combinations. For example, putting object 2 alone again. Let's see:\n\nCurrently, the machine has objects 2 and 4 on it (after step12), light off. If I take 4 off, machine has 2 alone. Light remains off. Then put 2 on again (but it's already there). No change. Then put 5 on. If light turns on, then maybe the rule requires 2 and 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut since I have limited steps, I need to think of the most efficient way to test. Given that object 2 seems to be involved in the activation, perhaps the next step is to take 4 off the machine and put 2 back on alone to see if light turns on. But according to previous steps, when 2 was alone, light was off. So maybe the rule requires 2 and another specific object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present, and object 2 is a blicket. Let's see:\n\n- In step4: 0,1,2 on. If 2 is a blicket, then one blicket (odd). Light on.\n\n- Remove 2: zero blickets (even). Light off.\n\n- Add 2 back: one blicket. Light on.\n\n- Remove 0: machine has 1 and 2. If 1 is not a blicket, then still one blicket. Light should stay on. But according to log, light turns off. Contradiction.\n\nSo maybe 1 is also a blicket. Let's try:\n\n- In step4: 0,1,2 on. If 1 and 2 are blickets (two blickets, even), light on. But then the rule would require even number of blickets.\n\n- Remove 2: leaves 0 and 1. One blicket (1). Odd. Light off.\n\n- Add 2 back: two blickets (1 and 2). Light on.\n\n- Remove 0: leaves 1 and 2. Two blickets. Light should stay on. But according to log, light turns off. Contradiction.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's a different rule, like the machine activates when the blicket is placed on top of the machine first. But object 6 was first, and light was off. Then when 0,1,2 were added, the light came on when 2 was added last. So maybe the order matters. Like the most recently added blicket activates it. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is based on the cumulative number of blickets placed on it. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: What if the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is a prime number? Let's see:\n\n- Step4: 3 objects. If 2 is a blicket, number of blickets is 1 (prime). Light on.\n\n- Remove 2: 0 blickets (non-prime). Light off.\n\n- Add 2 back: 1 (prime). Light on.\n\n- Remove 0: leaves 1 and 2. If 2 is a blicket, number is 1 (prime). Light should stay on. But log says off. Contradiction.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I should consider that the rule involves more than one blicket, but their combination. For example, both 2 and 5 are blickets, but they haven't been tested yet. But how to proceed?\n\nGiven the steps taken so far, the only time the light turned on was when 0,1,2 were on. But when 2 was added to 0 and 1, light came on. Then removing 2 made it off. Adding 2 back made it on. Then removing 0 made it off, even though 2 was still there. So the presence of 2 alone isn't sufficient. So perhaps the rule requires that 2 and at least one other object (any other) are present. But when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2, the light is off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, when 0 is removed (step7), machine has 1 and 2. Light off. Then removing 1 (step8), leaving 2, light remains off. So the light was on only when 0,1,2 are present. So maybe the rule is that all three of them must be on the machine. But why would that be the case? That would mean they're all blickets, but the machine requires all of them to be present. But then, if any one is removed, light turns off. That fits the observed behavior. But in that case, the rule would be that all blickets must be on the machine for it to activate. So if the blickets are 0,1,2, then all three must be present. But then, when they added 2 to 0 and 1 (step4), light on. Then removing 2 (step5), light off. Adding 2 back (step6), light on. Removing 0 (step7), light off. This fits. But how do we know that 0,1,2 are all blickets? Because when they were all present, the light was on. When any one is removed, light off. So the rule would be that the machine activates if and only if all blickets are present on it. So the blickets are 0,1,2. But that seems like a lot of blickets. And the user is supposed to find which objects are blickets and the rule.\n\nBut when they put 3 on the machine (step9), light remains off. So 3 is not a blicket. Similarly, 4 doesn't activate it. So perhaps the blickets are 0,1,2. The rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But that's possible. But then the machine would only activate when all three are present. But when they put 0,1,2 on, light on. Remove any one, light off. That fits.\n\nBut the user needs to determine which objects are blickets. If the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then any subset that includes all blickets would activate it. But according to this scenario, the only time the light was on is when 0,1,2 were on. So maybe those are the three blickets, and the rule is that all must be present. But how to confirm this?\n\nIf that's the case, then putting all three on should activate it, and removing any one deactivates. But the user has only tested with 0,1,2. Maybe they should test adding another object to see if it still works. For example, add 3 to the machine along with 0,1,2. If the light stays on, then the rule is that all blickets are present, regardless of others. If it turns off, then the rule is that exactly the blickets are present and no others.\n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. So perhaps the next step is to add object 0 back to the machine, which currently has 2 and 4. Let me see:\n\nCurrent state after step12: machine has objects 2 and 4. Light off.\n\nTo test whether adding 0 and 1 back would turn the light on, the user could try putting 0 and 1 on the machine again, along with 2. If the light comes on, then the rule requires all three (0,1,2) to be present. Then, adding 4 would make light stay on or turn off depending on whether the rule requires exactly those three or at least those three.\n\nBut given the step limit, the user needs to act efficiently. So the next command should be to put object 0 back on the machine to see if adding it along with 2 and 4 turns the light on."}

So the machine turns on when certain objects (blickets) are placed on it. The goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine activate.\n\nFrom the previous steps, here's what happened:\n\n- Initially, objects 0-5 and 7 were on the floor, 6 was on the machine. Taking 6 off didn't do anything.\n- Then, putting 0, 1, 2 on the machine: after adding 2, the light turned on. When 2 was removed, it turned off. Putting 2 back made it turn on again. So object 2 seems to be a blicket, but maybe there's more.\n- Then, when 0 and 1 were removed (with 2 still on the machine), the light stayed on until 2 was removed. So 2 alone can activate it. But then later, after removing 0 and 1, putting 2 back on turned it on again. So maybe 2 is a blicket by itself.\n- Then, putting 3 on the machine alone didn't activate it. Same with 4. So 3 and 4 are probably not blickets.\n- Then, putting 0 and 4 on, then adding 0 again (but 0 was already on the machine?), wait, the user put 0 on again. Wait, in the last step, after removing 0 and 1, then putting 3, 4, etc., then they put 0 on again, and the light turned on. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the last few steps:\n\nAfter taking 0 and 1 off, the machine was off. Then put 3 on, nothing. Then took 3 off. Then tried putting 2 on again, but it was already on. Then put 4 on, nothing. Then put 0 on again, and the light turned on. Hmm. So when 0 and 4 were on, adding 0 again (maybe they meant putting 0 on with 4 and 2?), but the machine light turned on. Wait, let me check the exact steps:\n\nWait, after taking 0,1,2 off (after the machine was off), then put 3 on, which didn't work. Then took 3 off. Then tried putting 2 on, but it was already on (wait, no\u2014the user had taken 2 off earlier, right? Let me re-examine the history step by step.\n\nOriginal state: objects 0-5 and 7 on floor, 6 on machine. Then:\n\n- Took object 6 off machine. Now all objects on floor except 6 was moved to floor.\n- Put 0 on machine. Machine off.\n- Put 1 on machine. Machine off.\n- Put 2 on machine. Machine turns on.\n- Took 2 off. Machine off.\n- Put 2 back on. Machine on.\n- Took 0 off. Machine off (since 2 and 1 were still on? Wait, no. After putting 0,1,2 on, machine was on. Then taking 0 off would leave 1 and 2 on. But the machine turned off. So that suggests that 1 and 2 alone (without 0) didn't keep it on. Wait, but earlier, when 0,1,2 were on, machine was on. Then taking 0 off made it turn off. So maybe the rule requires all three? Or maybe a different combination.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me retrace:\n\n1. After putting 0,1,2 on, machine turns on.\n2. Take 2 off: machine off.\n3. Put 2 back on: machine on again. So 2 alone (with 0 and 1?) Wait, no, because after step 3, when 0 and 1 were on, adding 2 made it turn on. Then taking 2 off made it turn off. So the presence of 2 is critical. But then, when 2 was put back, machine turned on again. So 2 seems to be a blicket. But when 0 and 1 were on (without 2), machine was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So perhaps 2 is a blicket and the machine requires at least one blicket. But then why when 0 and 1 were removed (after that step), putting 0 and 4 on and then 0 again made it turn on.\n\nWait, let's look at the last steps again:\n\n- After taking 0,1 off (machine was off with 2 on?), no. Wait, let's re-express the entire interaction:\n\nInitial state after user's commands:\n\n- After taking 6 off, all objects except 6 (now on floor), then:\n\nPut 0 on machine: machine off.\nPut 1 on machine: machine off.\nPut 2 on machine: machine turns on. So machine on when 0,1,2 are on.\n\nThen take 2 off: machine off. So machine off with 0 and 1 on.\n\nPut 2 back on: machine on again. So 0,1,2 on \u2192 machine on.\n\nTake 0 off: machine off. So 1 and 2 on \u2192 machine off? That suggests that 2 alone isn't sufficient. Or maybe there's a different rule.\n\nThen take 1 off: machine remains off (since 2 is on but 0 and 1 are off).\n\nPut 3 on machine: machine remains off.\n\nTake 3 off.\n\nPut 2 on (but 2 was already on? Wait, the user tried to put 2 on again, but the system said it's already on. So after taking 0 and 1 off, 2 was still on? Wait, no: when the user took 0 off, then took 1 off, but 2 was still on. So after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine had 2 on, but the light was off. Then the user tried to put 2 on again, but it was already there. Then put 4 on (so now 2 and 4 on machine). Light off. Then put 0 on (so 2,4,0 on machine). Light turns on.\n\nSo in that case, with 0,2,4 on the machine, the light is on. But when 2 was on alone (after removing 0 and 1), the light was off. But when 0 and 2 are on (plus 4), the light is on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the sum of the blickets' weights or some combination meets a condition. Alternatively, perhaps the machine requires exactly two blickets, or at least two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, let's list the cases where the machine turned on:\n\n1. When 0,1,2 were added (machine on). Then removing 2 turned it off. Adding 2 back turned it on. Then removing 0 turned it off. Then removing 1 (with 2 on) kept it off. Then putting 0 and 4 on (with 2 already on) made it turn on again.\n\nSo when 0,2,4 are on, machine on. So what's different between 0,2,4 and 2 alone or 2 and 4?\n\nPossibly, objects 0 and 2 are blickets. When 0 and 2 are both on, the machine activates. But in the first case, 0,1,2 were on. Machine on. Then removing 2 \u2192 off. Adding 2 \u2192 on. Then removing 0 \u2192 off. So if 0 and 2 are both required, that would explain it. But then when 0,2,4 are on, machine is on. But 4 may not be a blicket. So perhaps the rule is that at least two blickets are present, and 0 and 2 are blickets. Let's see:\n\nIf 0 and 2 are blickets:\n\n- 0,1,2 on \u2192 two blickets (0 and 2), machine on. But wait, if the rule is \"at least two blickets\", then yes. But then when 0 is removed, only 2 remains (one blicket), machine off. When 2 is added back (0 and 2), machine on. Then when 0 is removed again, machine off. Then when 0 is added again (with 2 and 4), machine on. So in that case, 0 and 2 are blickets. So the rule could be that the machine activates when two or more blickets are present. Alternatively, exactly two.\n\nBut then in the last step, putting 0 on machine (with 2 and 4 already on) made the machine turn on. So if 0 and 2 are blickets, then with 0,2,4 on, there are two blickets \u2192 machine on. So that fits.\n\nBut what about when 0 was on the machine alone (initially, after taking 6 off). Machine remained off. Then adding 1 \u2192 still off. Then adding 2 \u2192 on. So 0,1,2 on. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then two blickets \u2192 machine on. Then when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2 \u2192 one blicket (2), so machine off. That fits. Then adding 0 back (with 2 and 4) \u2192 two blickets \u2192 on.\n\nSo possible blickets: 0 and 2. Rule: machine activates when at least two blickets are present.\n\nBut wait, in the last step, the user put 0 on the machine again. But before that, the machine had 2 and 4 on it. Adding 0 (a blicket) makes the total blickets 2 (0 and 2) \u2192 machine on. That fits.\n\nBut then why in the step where only 2 was on the machine (after removing 0 and 1), the machine was off. Because only one blicket (2) was present.\n\nSo the rule could be that the machine requires at least two blickets to activate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of certain properties (like weights) meets a threshold. But given the steps, the simplest explanation is that two specific objects (0 and 2) are blickets, and the machine requires at least one of them. Wait, but in the first case, putting 0,1,2 on \u2192 machine on. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then two blickets. If the rule is \"at least one\", then even one would do. But in the initial step, putting 0 on alone didn't activate it. Then adding 1 (non-blicket) didn't help. Adding 2 (another blicket) turned it on. So if the rule is \"at least one\", then 0 alone should have activated it, which it didn't. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. Then, when 0 and 2 are on, it activates. But in the initial step, adding 0,1,2 (two blickets) would activate it. Then taking 2 off (now 0 is on, one blicket) \u2192 off. Adding 2 back \u2192 two blickets \u2192 on. Taking 0 off \u2192 one blicket (2) \u2192 off. Then putting 0 back (with 2 and 4) \u2192 two blickets (0 and 2) \u2192 on. So that fits.\n\nBut then in the step where 0,2,4 are on (three objects), but only two blickets (0 and 2), so machine on. Yes, that works. So rule: exactly two blickets. But wait, when you have three blickets, then it would still activate if the rule is \"at least two\". But the user hasn't tested that scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of the blickets' IDs equals a certain number. But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present. But when 0 and 2 are on (two, even) \u2192 on. When 2 is alone (one, odd) \u2192 off. When 0,2, and another blicket (if any) are on (three, odd) \u2192 off. But we don't have data on three blickets.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present, no more, no less. But how do the steps fit?\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates if any of the blickets are present, but only when in certain combinations. For example, 0 and 2 together. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, let's think of another angle. When the user put 0,1,2 on the machine, it turned on. Then removing 2 turned it off. Adding 2 back turned it on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So the presence of 0 and 2 together seems to activate the machine. But when 0 was added again with 2 and 4, it turned on. So maybe 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. That would explain:\n\n- 0 and 2 together \u2192 machine on.\n- Only one of them \u2192 off.\n- Both present even with others \u2192 on.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on (0 and 2 present) \u2192 on.\n- Remove 2 \u2192 only 0 \u2192 off.\n- Add 2 back \u2192 0 and 2 \u2192 on.\n- Remove 0 \u2192 only 2 \u2192 off.\n- Then, when 0 is added back (with 2 and 4) \u2192 0 and 2 present \u2192 on.\n\nThat fits. So the rule could be that both 0 and 2 must be present on the machine for it to activate. So the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut wait, in the last step, when 4 and 2 were on the machine (after the user had taken 0 and 1 off), then putting 0 on made the machine turn on. So 0,4,2: 0 and 2 are present \u2192 machine on. So the presence of 4 doesn't affect it. That fits.\n\nBut what about if 0 and 2 are the only blickets. Let's test other possibilities. For example, if 0 and 2 are blickets, then putting them on the machine should activate it regardless of other objects. Let's see:\n\n- In the first case, 0,1,2 \u2192 on. Correct.\n- Remove 2 \u2192 off. Correct.\n- Add 2 \u2192 on. Correct.\n- Remove 0 \u2192 off. Correct.\n- Add 0 again (with 2 and 4) \u2192 on. Correct.\n- If we put 0 and 2 on alone, machine should turn on. Let's see: when 0 was put on alone, then 1, then 2. After 0 and 1, machine was off. Adding 2 made it on. So yes, 0 and 2 together are needed. So the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be on the machine.\n\nSo the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that both must be present on the machine.\n\nBut wait, what about the step where after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine had 2 and 4 on it. The light was off. Then putting 0 on made it on. So 0,2,4 \u2192 on. That supports the idea that 0 and 2 together activate it, regardless of others.\n\nBut what if the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of blickets is exactly two? If 0 and 2 are blickets, then any time exactly two are present, it's on. But that doesn't fit because when they are both present with others, the count is still two, so machine should be on. Which matches the observation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. But then if there are three blickets, it should still be on. But the user hasn't tested that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. But in the initial step, 0 and 2 are two blickets, so machine on. If another blicket is added, say 3, but the user hasn't tested that.\n\nBut given the data so far, the most plausible rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. Because when either is missing, the machine turns off, and their presence together turns it on regardless of others.\n\nSo the next step would be to test if other combinations activate the machine. For example, putting 0 and 2 on without others. Or testing if other objects are also blickets.\n\nBut the user has limited steps. So perhaps the next command should be to test if 0 and 2 alone activate the machine.\n\nCurrent state: objects on the machine are 0,2,4. Machine is on. Because 0 and 2 are present.\n\nIf the user takes 4 off, does the machine stay on? Let's see:\n\nIf the rule is that 0 and 2 must be present, then removing 4 should keep the machine on.\n\nBut in the current step, the user just put 0 on, making the machine on (0,2,4). So the next command could be taking 4 off to see if the machine remains on.\n\nBut the user is supposed to output the next command. The last step was:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n\nSo currently, objects 0,2,4 are on the machine. The light is on. Because 0 and 2 are present.\n\nIf the user takes 4 off, the machine should still be on. So the next command could be 'take object 4 off machine' to test that.\n\nBut the user has to decide the next command. Alternatively, maybe test if 0 and 2 alone are sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, check other objects. For example, put 5 on the machine along with 0 and 2 to see if the machine stays on. If yes, then the rule is that 0 and 2 must be present regardless of others.\n\nBut given the step limit, the user may want to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, check if 0 and 2 can activate the machine alone.\n\nSo the next step would be to take 4 off machine, leaving 0 and 2. If the light stays on, that supports the rule.\n\nBut in the current state, the machine is on with 0,2,4. Taking 4 off would leave 0 and 2. If the machine remains on, then the rule is confirmed. If it turns off, then maybe there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, test if 0 alone activates the machine. But earlier steps show that 0 alone does not.\n\nAnother possibility is that the machine requires an even number of blickets, but with 0 and 2 being the only ones. Then, any even number (like 2) would activate it. But that's speculative.\n\nBut given the current information, the best hypothesis is that objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present on the machine.\n\nTo confirm, the user could remove 4 and see if the machine stays on. So the next command would be:\n\n> take object 4 off machine\n\nIf the light remains on, that supports the hypothesis. If it turns off, then 4 might also be a blicket. But earlier putting 4 on alone didn't activate it, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should test another combination. For example, put 5 on the machine along with 0 and 2. If the light remains on, then 5 is not a blicket, and the rule is about 0 and 2.\n\nBut given the step limit, perhaps the user should proceed to confirm the current hypothesis.\n\nSo the next command would be to take object 4 off and see if the light stays on."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. \n\nFirst, let's recap the interactions so far. Initially, object 6 was on the machine, but taking it off didn't change anything. Then, when objects 0, 1, and 2 were added one by one, the machine turned on only after adding object 2. But when object 2 was removed, the light went off. Then putting 2 back on turned it on again. So maybe object 2 is a blicket?\n\nThen, when objects 0 and 1 were removed, the machine turned off. But when object 0 was put back on with object 2, the light came on again. Wait, no, in the step where they put 0 and 2 on the machine, the light was on. Then they took off 0 and 1, leaving only 2, which should have kept the light on, but it turned off. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact sequence again.\n\nWait, let's list the steps:\n\n1. After taking 6 off, machine is off.\n2. Put 0 on: still off.\n3. Put 1 on: still off.\n4. Put 2 on: light turns on.\n5. Take 2 off: light off.\n6. Put 2 back: light on.\n7. Take 0 off: light off. Wait, but at this point, object 2 was still on the machine, right? Because after step 6, 0,1,2 were on the machine. Then taking 0 off (step7) would leave 1 and 2. But the light turned off. That suggests that having 1 and 2 together doesn't activate the machine. But when 2 was alone (step6?), after putting 2 back on, the light was on. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps.\n\nWait, let's clarify the exact sequence:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2 on machine: light is on. Then take 2 off: light off. Then put 2 back on: light on. So with 0,1,2 on the machine, light is on. Then take 0 off: light off. Wait, that would leave 1 and 2 on the machine, but the light is off. So that suggests that 2 alone isn't enough. But earlier, when 2 was put back on after being removed, maybe other objects were present? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the steps after initial setup:\n\n- take object6 off, light off.\n\n- put 0 on: light off.\n\n- put 1 on: light off.\n\n- put 2 on: light turns on.\n\nSo with 0,1,2 on machine, light is on.\n\nThen take 2 off: light off. Now, machine has 0 and 1. Light off.\n\nPut 2 back on: machine now has 0,1,2 again. Light on.\n\nThen take 0 off: machine has 1 and 2. Light off. So even with 2 present, if 1 is there but not 0, it's off.\n\nTake 1 off: machine has only 2. Light off. Wait, but earlier, when 2 was put on after removing it, the light came on again. Wait, no, after taking 2 off, they put 2 back on, but at that point, 0 and 1 were still on the machine. So when 2 was added back, the machine had 0,1,2 again, so light on. Then taking 0 off (step7) leaves 1 and 2, light off. Then taking 1 off (step8) leaves only 2, but light is off.\n\nSo that suggests that 2 alone isn't enough, but when combined with 0 and 1, it works. But then in another step, when they put 0 and 4 on the machine, and then take 4 off, the light stays on. Let me check that.\n\nAnother sequence:\n\nAfter some steps, they put object0 on machine (light off), then object1 (off), then object2 (on). Then take 2 off (off), put 2 on (on). Then take 0 and 1 off (off). Then they try object3 (off), object4 (off), then object0 and 2 again. Wait, no, after that, they put object0 on machine again, which when added to existing objects (maybe 2 is still on?), the light turns on. Then they take 4 off (which was added in between?), but the light stays on.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nAfter taking 0 and 1 off (steps 7 and 8), the machine has only 2. Light is off. Then they put object3 on (step9), light off. Take 3 off (step10), light off. Try to put 2 on again (step11), but 2 was already on the machine (since after step6, 2 was on, and step7 took 0 off, step8 took 1 off, leaving 2 on. Wait, no, step6: put 2 on machine (so machine has 0,1,2). Then step7: take 0 off (machine has 1,2). Step8: take 1 off (machine has 2). So after step8, machine has 2. But step11: trying to put 2 on again, but it's already there. Then step12: put 4 on machine (now machine has 2 and 4). Light still off. Then step13: put 0 on machine (machine has 0,2,4). Light turns on. Then step14: take 4 off (machine has 0 and 2). Light stays on.\n\nSo in this case, with 0 and 2 on the machine, the light is on. So that suggests that 0 and 2 together activate the machine. But earlier, when 0,1,2 were on, light was on. Then removing 1, leaving 0 and 2, but after taking 0 off (step7), machine had 1 and 2 (light off). Then when 0 was put back (step13), machine had 0,2,4, light on. Then removing 4 left 0 and 2, light on. So that suggests that 0 and 2 together are sufficient.\n\nBut wait, earlier when 0 and 2 were on the machine (after step14), the light is on. But in an earlier scenario, when the machine had 2 alone, the light was off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present? So if both 0 and 2 are blickets, then when they are together, it activates. But then why when 0,1,2 were on, it activated? Because 0 and 2 are blickets, 1 is not. So the presence of two blickets (0 and 2) would activate, regardless of other objects. But in the case where 0 and 2 are present with others, it's still on. So the rule might be that the machine activates when there are two or more blickets on it. So if 0 and 2 are blickets, then whenever they're both on the machine, it's on. Let's check the steps:\n\n- Step4: put 2 on machine (after 0 and 1). Now 0,1,2 on machine. Light on. If 0 and 2 are blickets, that's two, so rule satisfied.\n\n- Step6: put 2 back on (after removing it), so machine has 0,1,2 again. Light on.\n\n- Step7: take 0 off. Now 1 and 2. Only 2 is a blicket. So light off.\n\n- Step13: put 0 on machine (which already has 2 and 4). Now 0,2,4. Two blickets (0 and 2), so light on.\n\n- Step14: take 4 off. Now 0 and 2. Still two blickets. Light remains on.\n\nSo this seems to fit. Then the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are on it. The blickets are 0 and 2.\n\nBut let's check other steps. For example, when they put object3 on machine (step9), light remains off. So 3 is not a blicket. Object4 was put on in step12: light off. Then when 0 was added (step13), light on. So 4 is not a blicket. Object5 hasn't been tested yet. Object6 was initially on the machine but taking it off didn't affect anything. But when they put 0,2,4 on, and remove 4, light stays on. So 4 isn't a blicket. Object5 hasn't been tested. What about object7?\n\nThe user hasn't interacted with objects 5 and 7 yet. So maybe those could be blickets? But according to the current data, only 0 and 2 seem to be blickets. Let's see if there's any evidence otherwise.\n\nWait, in step13, when they put 0 on the machine (which already had 2 and 4), the light turned on. That suggests that adding 0 (a blicket) to 2 (another blicket) and 4 (non-blicket) makes the total blickets two, so light on. Then removing 4 (non-blicket) leaves two blickets, so light stays on. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe we need to test other combinations. For example, check if object5 or 7 is a blicket. But given the step limit, maybe the user is trying to confirm the hypothesis that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is at least two blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of blicktness is even, or some other condition. But the current evidence points to at least two blickets.\n\nBut let's think: when 0 and 2 are on the machine, light is on. When either is removed, it's off. That suggests that both are needed. Wait, but earlier when 0,1,2 were on, light was on. If the rule was exactly two blickets, then adding 1 (non-blicket) wouldn't affect. But in the case where the rule is at least two, then it's okay. So the rule is probably that the machine turns on when there are at least two blickets on it.\n\nBut maybe there's another rule. For example, the machine turns on when the number of blickets is even. But in that case, if there are two blickets, it's even. If three, it's odd. But in the steps where 0,2, and another blicket (if any) are on, the light would depend on the count. But we don't have evidence of three blickets.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine requires exactly two blickets. But in the step where 0,2,4 are on (assuming 4 is non-blicket), then two blickets (0 and 2) would activate it, which fits.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other possibility. For example, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket, but that's not the case because when 2 was alone, the light was off. So at least two.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine requires all blickets to be present. But if there are more than two blickets, that's not the case. But based on the current tests, we only have two blickets (0 and 2) identified. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. Let's see: when both are present, light is on. Otherwise, off. That fits all observations so far.\n\nIn step13, putting 0 on when 2 and 4 are present activates the light. Then removing 4 (non-blicket) leaves 0 and 2, light stays on. If the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present, then that's the case. So the machine turns on if and only if both 0 and 2 are on it.\n\nBut wait, earlier when 0,1,2 were on, the light was on. If the rule is that both 0 and 2 are required, then the presence of 1 doesn't matter. Which aligns with that observation.\n\nBut what about other objects? For example, if 5 or 7 were blickets, but the user hasn't tested them yet. So maybe there's more to it. However, given the steps taken, the user might not have tested all objects, but based on the data so far, 0 and 2 are the likely candidates.\n\nSo to confirm, the user could test putting 0 and 2 on the machine alone. Wait, they did that in step14: after taking 4 off, the machine has 0 and 2, and the light is on. So that supports the hypothesis.\n\nAnother test: take 0 off, leaving 2. Light off. Put 0 back on, light on. That's exactly what happened in steps13-14. So yes.\n\nNow, what about other objects? For example, if we put 5 and 0 on the machine, does the light turn on? If not, then 5 is not a blicket. Similarly for 7. But given the step limit, the user might want to confirm with minimal steps.\n\nBut the user has 32 steps, and they have used 14 so far. Let's see what the next step should be.\n\nThe previous step was taking 4 off, leaving 0 and 2 on the machine, light on. So now, the machine has 0 and 2. The user might want to test adding another object to see if the light remains on (if the rule is at least two blickets) or if it requires exactly 0 and 2.\n\nFor example, put object5 on the machine. If the light stays on, then 5 is not a blicket, and the rule is that at least two blickets are present. If the light stays on, then adding a non-blicket doesn't affect. If the light goes off, that would suggest a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that exactly 0 and 2 must be present, then adding any other object would not affect the light. But in the previous step where 0,2,4 were on, the light was on. So the rule is not that only 0 and 2 are present. It must be that the presence of 0 and 2 (as blickets) is sufficient, regardless of other objects.\n\nSo, to confirm, the user might add another object (say, 5) to the machine (currently has 0 and 2). If the light remains on, then 5 is not a blicket, and the rule is that having at least two blickets (0 and 2) is enough. If the light goes off, that would be unexpected. But according to prior steps, when 0,2, and 4 were on, the light was on. So adding non-blickets doesn't affect. So adding 5 should keep the light on.\n\nAlternatively, the user could test if any other pair of objects activates the machine. For example, putting 0 and 5 on. If the light doesn't turn on, then 5 is not a blicket. But the user might not have done that yet.\n\nIn the current state, the machine has 0 and 2 on it, light on. To check if another object is a blicket, the user could take 0 or 2 off and try adding another object with the remaining. For example, take 0 off (light off), then add 5 and 2. If the light turns on, then 5 is a blicket. But given the previous steps, the user hasn't found other blickets yet.\n\nBut considering the step count, maybe the user is confident that 0 and 2 are the only blickets and the rule is that the machine turns on when both are present. Alternatively, the rule could be that the sum of their blicktness is even, but that's less likely based on the data.\n\nAnother angle: when the machine had 0,2,4 (non-blicket), the light was on. Then removing 4 (non-blicket) leaves 0 and 2, light stays on. So the presence of non-blickets doesn't affect. So the rule is about the blickets only.\n\nThus, the most likely conclusion is that objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are placed on it. Or that specific pair. Wait, but when the machine had 0 and 2, light was on. If there's another pair of blickets, like 2 and 5, then putting them on should also activate. But since the user hasn't tested that, maybe they should.\n\nBut given the steps taken, the user hasn't tested other combinations. However, given the evidence, the most efficient conclusion is that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when both are present. Alternatively, the rule could be that exactly those two are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates if any two blickets are present. But if there are more than two blickets, then adding any two would work. But since the user hasn't tested other objects, they can't confirm. But based on the data, 0 and 2 are the only ones that caused the activation.\n\nSo, the next command should probably be to test another object with 2. For example, put object5 on the machine along with 2. If the light doesn't turn on, then 5 is not a blicket. But currently, the machine has 0 and 2. The user could take 0 off and add another object with 2.\n\nBut the user's next step in the log is after step14: machine has 0 and 2, light on. So the user's next command could be to add object5 to see if the light stays on (indicating 5 is a non-blicket) or goes off (which would complicate things). But according to prior steps, adding non-blickets doesn't affect the light. So adding 5 should keep the light on. But the user might want to test that.\n\nAlternatively, the user might think they have enough info and exit. But to be thorough, maybe test another object. Let's say the user decides to test object5.\n\nSo the next command could be 'put object5 on machine'. If the light stays on, then 5 is not a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe there's a different rule. But based on prior steps, adding non-blickets doesn't turn off the light. So if they add 5, light should stay on. That would confirm that 5 isn't a blicket.\n\nBut the user might also want to check if object7 is a blicket. Or take 0 off and put 7 on with 2 to see.\n\nAlternatively, the user could take 0 off the machine (light off), then put 2 and 7 on to see if the light turns on. If not, then 7 isn't a blicket.\n\nBut given the step count, the user might want to confirm all possibilities. However, given the current data, the most likely answer is that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when both are present. Or that at least two are present. But given that when they were both present, the machine was on, and when only one was present, it was off, it's likely that the rule is that both must be present.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the sum of their blicktness is even. But if 0 and 2 each have 1, then sum is 2 (even). If only one is present, sum is 1 (odd). But that's another possible rule. But without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut given the interactions, the simplest rule is that the machine activates when both 0 and 2 are present. Because every time both are on the machine, the light is on, and if either is removed, it's off.\n\nSo the next command should be to test another combination to confirm. For example, take both 0 and 2 off, and try putting another pair, like 3 and 4, to see if the light turns on. If not, it confirms that 3 and 4 are not blickets.\n\nAlternatively, take 0 and 2 off, then put 5 and 6 on. But given the step count, the user might proceed to exit now if they think they have the answer.\n\nIn the current state, the machine has 0 and 2 on, light on. The user might decide to exit now, having determined that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present."}

I need to figure out if object 0 is a blicket. From the steps taken, let me recap what happened.\n\nInitially, the machine had object 6 on it. When they took object 6 off, the light was off. Then they put object 0 and 1 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then when they added object 2, the light turned on. So at that point, objects 0,1,2 were on the machine. Light on. Then they removed object 2, light went off. Then putting 2 back on made the light come on again. That suggests that object 2 alone can activate the machine. But wait, when they later put object 0 and 4 on, then added 0 again (maybe after taking others off?), the light came on. Wait, let's check the exact steps again.\n\nWait, after taking 0 and 1 off, they tried 3, which didn't work. Then they tried putting 2 back on, but it was already there? Then they put 4 on, which didn't do anything. Then they put 0 back on, and the light turned on. Then when they took 4 off, the light stayed on. So when object 0 and 2 were on the machine (since after taking 4 off, 0 and 2 are on?), wait no. Let me re-examine the sequence step by step.\n\nOriginal state: All objects on floor except 6 on machine. They took 6 off. Then put 0,1,2 on machine. Light turned on when 2 was added. Then they took 2 off, light off. Put 2 back on, light on. Then took 0 and 1 off (so only 2 on machine?), but light went off. Then put 3 on machine (so only 3?), light off. Took 3 off. Tried putting 2 on again, but it was already there (maybe they had taken it off earlier? Wait, maybe after taking 0 and 1 off, 2 was still on the machine. Then they took 2 off? Wait the steps are:\n\nAfter putting 2 on machine again (light on), then they take 0 off (so 1 and 2 are on machine?), then take 1 off (so only 2 on machine). Then light is off. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, when they took 0 off, the machine had 1 and 2. Then taking 1 off would leave only 2. But if 2 was supposed to activate the machine, why did the light go off? Unless the rule isn't that 2 alone is a blicket. Hmm, maybe the rule is that multiple blickets are required. Let's retrace:\n\nStep 1: After putting 0,1,2 on machine: light turns on. Then taking 2 off makes light off. Putting 2 back on makes light on again. So when 0,1,2 are on, light is on. But when only 2 is on, light is off. Wait, when they took 0 and 1 off, leaving 2, the light was off. So that suggests that 2 alone isn't enough. So perhaps the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. Then in the initial step, adding 0,1,2 caused activation. But which of those are blickets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0 and 2 are blickets. Let's see. When they had 0 and 2 on the machine (after adding 0 again later), the light turned on. Let's look at the later steps:\n\nThey put 0 and 4 on the machine. Wait, no. After trying object 3 and 4, they put object 0 on machine again. The steps were:\n\nAfter taking 3 off, they tried to put 2 on, but it was already there. Then put 4 on machine (light off). Then put 0 on machine, which made the light turn on. So when 0 was added to 2 and 4 (assuming 2 was already on machine?), but wait, earlier steps might have removed 2. Wait, maybe there's confusion here.\n\nLet me list each action and the machine's state:\n\n1. Start: 6 on machine. Take 6 off. Now machine empty.\n\n2. Put 0 on machine. Machine: 0. Light off.\n\n3. Put 1 on machine. Machine: 0,1. Light off.\n\n4. Put 2 on machine. Machine: 0,1,2. Light turns on.\n\nSo, adding 2 caused the light to turn on. Then take 2 off. Machine: 0,1. Light off.\n\nPut 2 back on. Machine: 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nTake 0 off. Machine: 1,2. Light off.\n\nTake 1 off. Machine: 2. Light off.\n\nSo with only 2 on, light is off. Then put 3 on. Machine: 2,3. Light off. Take 3 off. Put 2 again (but it's already there?), maybe that step was a mistake. Then put 4 on. Machine: 2,4. Light off. Then put 0 on. Machine: 0,2,4. Light turns on. Then take 4 off. Machine: 0,2. Light stays on.\n\nSo when 0 and 2 are on, light is on. That suggests that both 0 and 2 are blickets. Because when they're both present, the machine activates. Even if there's another object (like 4), but when 4 is removed, leaving 0 and 2, the light remains on.\n\nSo from this, the rule might be that the machine activates if there's at least two blickets on it. And the blickets are 0 and 2.\n\nBut wait, when initially 0,1,2 were on the machine and light turned on. Then taking 2 off made light off. Putting 2 back on made light on again. Then removing 0 and 1 (so only 2) made light off. Then later, putting 0 and 2 on (with 4) and then removing 4 leaves 0 and 2, and light is on. So that supports the idea that 0 and 2 are both blickets.\n\nSo, object 0 is a blicket because when it's on the machine with 2, the light is on. If only one of them is on, the light is off. So the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Therefore, 0 is a blicket."}

So from the interactions, the machine turns on when certain combinations of objects are placed on it. Let me go through each step to see what happened.\n\nInitially, object 6 was on the machine, but the light was off. Then the user took it off. Then they put 0, 1, and 2 on the machine. When they added object 2, the light turned on. Then removing 2 turned it off, and putting it back on turned it on again. So object 2 seems to be a blicket because adding it caused the light to turn on. \n\nNext, they removed 0 and 1, leaving only 2, but the light went off when they took 0 off. Wait, no\u2014when they took 0 and 1 off, but object 2 was still on the machine. Wait, no, let me check again. After putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light was on. Then they took 2 off, which made the light go off. Then putting 2 back on made it turn on again. Then they removed 0 and 1. At that point, the machine only had object 2. Wait, but when they took 0 off, the light was off. Wait, after they took 2 off, the light was off. Then they put 2 back, and it turned on. Then they took 0 and 1 off. Wait, the machine had object 2 on it. So after removing 0 and 1, the machine still had object 2. But the light turned off when they took 0 off. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the steps again.\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light turns on. Then taking 2 off makes the light go off. Then putting 2 back on turns it on again. So at this point, the machine has 0,1,2. Wait, no\u2014when they took 2 off, then put 2 back on, so the machine would have 0,1,2 again. Then taking 0 off (machine has 1,2) makes the light go off. Then taking 1 off (machine now has 2) leaves the light off. Wait, but when they had only 2 on the machine earlier, the light was on. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me retrace:\n\n1. After putting 0,1,2 on the machine, light is on.\n2. Take 2 off: light off. Machine has 0 and 1.\n3. Put 2 back on: machine has 0,1,2. Light on again.\n4. Take 0 off: machine now has 1 and 2. Light off.\n5. Take 1 off: machine has 2. Light off.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Because when 2 was on the machine alone before, the light was on. But after removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, the light is off. That suggests that the presence of 2 alone isn't enough. Hmm, maybe the rule isn't just having at least one blicket. Maybe it's a specific combination.\n\nThen later, the user put 0 and 4 on the machine. The light was off. Then adding 0 made the light turn on when they put 0 on (after putting 4 and 0, machine had 4 and 0. Then adding 0 again, but maybe that's a typo. Wait, the steps are:\n\nAfter some steps, user puts object 3 on machine, light off. Then removes 3. Then puts 2 on again, but it's already there. Then puts 4 on, light off. Then puts 0 on, making the machine have 4 and 0. The light turns on. Then removing 4 leaves 0 on the machine, and the light stays on. So when only object 0 is on the machine, the light is on. But earlier, when 0 was removed from 0,1,2, the light turned off. Wait, that's confusing. Let me see:\n\nAt one point, putting 0 and 4 on the machine (light off). Then putting 0 on again (maybe redundant, but the light turns on. Then removing 4 leaves 0 on, and light stays on. So object 0 alone can activate the machine. But earlier, when 0,1,2 were on the machine, and then 0 was taken off (leaving 1 and 2), the light turned off. But if 0 alone can activate, why did removing 0 turn it off when 2 was still on the machine?\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that maybe the rule isn't just having any one blicket. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the blickets' weights is even, or some other condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific combination. Let's try to see possible patterns.\n\nFirst, when objects 0,1,2 are on the machine, the light is on. Taking 2 off (leaving 0 and 1) turns it off. Putting 2 back on (0,1,2) turns it on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) turns it off. Taking 1 off (leaving 2) also keeps it off. But earlier, when 2 was put on alone, the light turned on. Wait, no. The first time: put 0,1,2 on. Light on. Remove 2: light off. Then put 2 back on (so machine has 0,1,2 again) and light is on. Then removing 0 (machine has 1 and 2) turns light off. Then removing 1 (machine has 2) leaves light off. But earlier, when 2 was placed alone, the light was on. So this is a contradiction unless there's a timing issue or a different rule.\n\nWait, let's check the exact steps again:\n\n1. Initially, after putting 0,1,2 on the machine, light is on.\n\n2. Take 2 off: light off. Machine has 0 and 1.\n\n3. Put 2 back on: machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\n4. Take 0 off: machine has 1 and 2. Light off.\n\n5. Take 1 off: machine has 2. Light off.\n\nBut when they first put 0 on the machine (alone?), then 1, then 2, and the light turned on when adding 2. Then, when they put 2 back on (after removing it), the machine had 0,1,2 again, so the light turned on. But then removing 0 (machine has 1 and 2) turns the light off. But if 2 is a blicket, then having 2 on the machine should turn it on. But in this case, with 1 and 2 on, the light is off. That suggests that 2's effect is dependent on other objects. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only if exactly one blicket is present. Wait, but when 2 was added initially, with 0 and 1, the light turned on. But maybe 0 and 1 are not blickets, and 2 is. Then adding 2 would activate the machine. But in the case where 2 is on with 1 (after removing 0), the light is off. That doesn't make sense unless 1 is a blicket that cancels 2's effect. That seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. Let's see.\n\nSuppose 2 is a blicket. When 0,1,2 are on, perhaps 0 and 2 are blickets (even count). Then removing 0 leaves 2 (count 1, odd) so light off. But when 2 is alone, count is 1, which is odd, so light off. Wait, but in the first step, when they added 2, the light turned on. So maybe the rule is that the sum of blickets' IDs or some other attribute. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates if the total number of blickets is at least 1, but then the case where 2 is alone would activate it, but in step 5, when 2 is alone, the light is off. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, let's recheck the steps carefully. The initial steps:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light turns on when 2 is added. Then, removing 2 turns it off. Adding 2 back turns it on. So 2 is likely a blicket. Then, when they remove 0, leaving 1 and 2 on the machine, the light turns off. Then removing 1 leaves 2 on, but the light remains off. That suggests that 2 alone doesn't activate the machine, but 2 with 0 and 1 does. But that contradicts the initial step where adding 2 (with 0 and 1 already on) turned the light on. Wait, no\u2014the initial sequence was: put 0 on (light off), put 1 on (still off), put 2 on (light on). So adding 2 caused the light to turn on. So 2 must be a blicket, and the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket. But then, when 2 is on the machine alone, why doesn't the light stay on?\n\nAh, but in the step where they took 0 and 1 off, leaving 2, the light turned off. That's conflicting. Unless there's a different rule. Maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on the machine. So if there are multiple blickets, all must be present. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. Let's see. Let's consider that objects 0 and 2 are blickets. When they are both on the machine, the light is on. When only 2 is on, it's off. Let's check:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on: 0 and 2 are blickets (two), so light on. Remove 2: only 0 (one), light off. Put 2 back: two again, light on. Remove 0: only 2 (one), light off. Then when they later put 0 and 4 on (light off), then adding 0 again (so 0 and 4 and 0?) but maybe the step was put 0 on after 4. So machine has 4 and 0. Then adding 0 again does nothing, but the light turns on. Wait, the user's steps after that were:\n\n- put object 4 on machine (light off)\n- put object 0 on machine (machine now has 4 and 0, light turns on)\n- take object 4 off (machine has 0, light remains on)\n\nSo in this case, object 0 alone causes the light to be on. So object 0 must be a blicket. Then why earlier, when 0 was removed from 0,1,2 (leaving 1 and 2), the light turned off. If 0 is a blicket, then when 0 is on the machine alone, the light is on. But when 0 and 2 are on (if 2 is also a blicket), then the light should be on. But in the earlier step, after putting 0,1,2 on, removing 0 caused the light to turn off even though 2 was on. If 2 is a blicket, then the light should stay on. This contradiction suggests that perhaps the rule is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the total number of blickets is odd. So if there are an odd number of blickets on the machine, it turns on. Let's test this:\n\n- Suppose blickets are 0 and 2.\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on: two blickets (even) \u2192 off. But initially, adding 2 made it turn on. So that contradicts.\n\n- If 2 is the only blicket. Adding 2 (when 0 and 1 are already on) \u2192 total 1 blicket (odd) \u2192 on. Then, removing 0 (machine has 1 and 2) \u2192 1 blicket \u2192 should stay on. But in the steps, it turned off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present, but only when placed in a certain order. Or maybe the machine requires that all objects on it are blickets. If the machine has any non-blicket, it doesn't activate. But that would mean all objects on the machine must be blickets. Let's test that:\n\n- If 0 and 2 are blickets. When 0,1,2 are on (1 is not a blicket), machine has a non-blicket \u2192 off. But in the first step, adding 2 (with 0 and 1) turned the light on. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let's look at the later steps. When the user put 0 and 4 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 0 again (or perhaps putting 0 on when it's already there) made the light turn on. Then removing 4 left 0, and the light stayed on. So object 0 alone activates the machine. That suggests 0 is a blicket. Then earlier, when 0,1,2 were on the machine, the light was on. But when 0 was removed, leaving 1 and 2, the light turned off. If 2 isn't a blicket, that makes sense. But earlier, adding 2 made the light turn on. So how does that work?\n\nWait, the sequence:\n\n- Put 0 on machine (light off)\n- Put 1 on machine (light off)\n- Put 2 on machine (light turns on)\n\nSo adding 2 caused the activation. So 2 must be a blicket. Then, when 0,1,2 are on (with 0 and 2 as blickets), the machine is on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 (blicket 2), so machine should stay on. But in the steps, removing 0 made the light turn off. That suggests that the presence of 0 is necessary. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the blickets' identifiers is even. Let's say 0 and 2 are blickets. 0 + 2 = 2 (even) \u2192 on. When 2 is alone, sum is 2 (even) \u2192 should be on, but in the steps, when 2 was alone after removing 0 and 1, the light was off. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when the number of blickets is a multiple of 3. Or maybe it's a combination of specific objects. For example, the machine requires both 0 and 2 to be on. Let's test this:\n\n- When 0 and 2 are both on \u2192 light on. Any other combination \u2192 off.\n\nIn the first step: putting 0, then 1, then 2. When 2 is added, 0 and 2 are both present \u2192 light on. Then removing 0 \u2192 only 2 \u2192 light off. That fits. Then, later putting 0 and 4 \u2192 light off. Then adding 0 again (machine has 0 and 4 and 0?), no\u2014maybe the user put 0 on when 4 was already there. So machine has 4 and 0. Then adding 0 again does nothing, but the light turns on. So if the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present, but in this case, 0 is present alone and the light is on. That contradicts.\n\nWait, when they put 0 and 4 on the machine (light off). Then put 0 on again (maybe redundant, but the light turns on. Then removing 4 leaves 0 alone, and the light stays on. So 0 alone activates the machine. So the rule must be that 0 is a blicket. But earlier, when 0 was on with 1 and 2, the machine was on. Removing 0 made it off, but if 2 is a blicket, then the machine should stay on. But in that case, removing 0 (a blicket) and leaving 2 (another blicket) would mean the machine has a blicket, so light should stay on. But according to the steps, it turned off. This suggests that 2 isn't a blicket, but then why did adding 2 cause the light to turn on initially?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try to list all the cases where the light was on:\n\n1. Objects 0,1,2 on \u2192 light on when 2 added. So when 2 is added to 0 and 1, light turns on. So either 2 is a blicket, or the combination of 0,1,2 (but that's three objects, maybe some other rule).\n\n2. After removing 0 and 1, leaving 2 \u2192 light off. So 2 alone doesn't activate.\n\n3. Later, putting 0 on (with 4 on the machine) \u2192 light turns on. So 0 alone (after removing 4) activates. So 0 is a blicket.\n\nSo from this, 0 is a blicket. But why did adding 2 to 0 and 1 activate the light? If 0 is a blicket, then even with 0 alone, the light is on. But when 0 was first put on the machine (alone), the light was off. Then adding 1 \u2192 still off. Then adding 2 \u2192 light on. So maybe 0 and 2 together activate it. But later, when 0 is alone, it's on. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, when the user first put 0 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 1 \u2192 still off. Then adding 2 \u2192 light on. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when two or more blickets are present. If 0 and 2 are both blickets, then adding 2 makes the count 2 \u2192 light on. Then, when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2 (only one blicket) \u2192 light off. But later, when 0 is put on the machine alone, the light is on. Which would mean that 0 is a blicket and the rule is at least one blicket. But in the first step, 0 alone didn't activate. So this is inconsistent.\n\nThis suggests that the rule might change, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my observations.\n\nWait, let's recheck the exact steps again:\n\nInitial state: objects 0-7 on floor except 6, which was on machine. Then user took 6 off.\n\nThen:\n\n1. put 0 on \u2192 light off\n2. put 1 on \u2192 light off\n3. put 2 on \u2192 light on\n4. take 2 off \u2192 light off\n5. put 2 on \u2192 light on (machine has 0,1,2)\n6. take 0 off \u2192 light off (machine has 1,2)\n7. take 1 off \u2192 light off (machine has 2)\n8. put 3 on \u2192 light off\n9. take 3 off \u2192 light off\n10. put 2 on (already there \u2192 no change)\n11. put 4 on \u2192 light off (machine has 2,4)\n12. put 0 on \u2192 light on (machine has 2,4,0)\n13. take 4 off \u2192 light on (machine has 2,0)\n\nSo after step 12, when 0 is added to 2 and 4, the light turns on. Then removing 4 leaves 0 and 2, light remains on.\n\nWait, this changes things. So after step 12, machine has objects 0,2,4. Light on. Then removing 4 leaves 0 and 2, light remains on. So when 0 and 2 are on the machine together, the light is on. Also, when 0 is on alone (after removing 4), light stays on. But earlier, when 0 was first put on alone, the light was off. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in step 1, putting 0 on the machine (alone) \u2192 light off. But in step 12, putting 0 on when 2 and 4 are already there \u2192 light on. Then removing 4 (leaving 0 and 2) \u2192 light on. Then when they exit, the machine has 0 and 2. So in that case, the light is on. But earlier, when 0 was first placed alone, light was off. So this suggests that 0 and 2 together activate the machine. But then, why does putting 0 on the machine (with 4) activate it? Unless the combination of 0 and 4 also activates. But when 0 and 4 were on the machine (step 11, after putting 4 and 0), light was off. Then adding 0 again (step 12) made the light turn on. But how? Unless the user made a typo, but assuming the steps are correct, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the sum of the object numbers is even. Let's test:\n\n- 0 +1 +2 =3 \u2192 odd. But when they added 2, light turned on (3 is odd). So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on if any of the blickets is on it, but only if placed in a certain order. But that doesn't explain the later steps.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if an odd number of blickets are present. Suppose 0 and 2 are blickets. Then:\n\n- When 0 is alone (1 blicket) \u2192 odd \u2192 on. But in step 1, light was off. So contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if exactly one blicket is present. But when 0 and 2 are both present (two), light is on in later steps. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to list all the cases where the light was on:\n\n- When 0,1,2 were on (after adding 2): light on.\n- When 0,2,4 were on: light on.\n- When 0 and 2 were on: light on.\n- When 0 alone: light on (after removing 4).\n\nCases where light was off:\n\n- 0 alone (initial step).\n- 0 and 1 on.\n- 1 and 2 on.\n- 2 alone.\n- 3 alone.\n- 4 and 0 on (before adding 0 again? Not sure).\n\nWait, the step where they put 0 on after 4 was already there (step 12):\n\n- Machine had 4 and 0 (from steps 11 and 12). Putting 0 on again (maybe redundant) made the light turn on. So machine has 4 and 0. Then removing 4 leaves 0, light stays on.\n\nBut in the initial step, putting 0 alone didn't activate. So why does 0 alone activate here? That suggests that the rule isn't consistent, which isn't possible. Therefore, there must be a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the machine activates when the total number of objects on it is even. Let's see:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 3 objects (odd) \u2192 light off. But in step 3, adding 2 made the light on. So no.\n\nAlternatively, even number of objects:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 3 (odd) \u2192 light on. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the machine activates when a blicket is added. So the act of placing a blicket on the machine toggles the light. But that doesn't fit because removing a blicket would also toggle.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's state depends on the presence of at least one blicket, but only updates when an object is added or removed. For example, adding a blicket turns it on, removing all blickets turns it off. But in step 1, adding 0 (a possible blicket) didn't turn it on. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket and the total number of objects is even. Let's see:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on (3 objects, if 2 is a blicket): 3 is odd \u2192 light off. But light was on. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if the number of blickets is greater than or equal to 2. So:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on (if 0 and 2 are blickets) \u2192 2 \u2192 light on. Removing 0 \u2192 1 blicket \u2192 light off. Then putting 0 back \u2192 2 again \u2192 light on. Then putting 4 and 0 (if 0 is a blicket and 4 is not) \u2192 1 blicket \u2192 light off. Adding 0 again \u2192 2 blickets (0 and 0?) No, objects are unique. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find which objects are definitely blickets based on the steps:\n\n1. When 0,1,2 were added, light turned on when 2 was added. So 2 must be a blicket, because adding it caused activation.\n\n2. When 0 was added later (after 4), light turned on. So 0 must be a blicket. Because adding 0 to 4 and 0 (maybe redundant) activated it.\n\nSo 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\nBut in the initial step, when 0 was added alone, light was off. But later, when 0 was added with 4, then after removing 4, 0 alone made the light on. This suggests that the rule isn't simply presence of a blicket. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the blicket IDs is even. 0 + 2 = 2 (even) \u2192 on. When 0 alone (sum 0, even) \u2192 on. But why in the initial step, putting 0 alone didn't activate?\n\nWait, in the initial steps:\n\n- After taking object 6 off, the user puts 0 on \u2192 light off.\n\nBut later, after step 12, putting 0 on makes the light on. So this is conflicting. Unless there's a different rule. For example, the machine requires that blickets are placed in a certain order, or that they are activated by being placed after another object. Or perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when a blicket is placed on top of another object. But that's getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the number of blickets on it is odd. Let's see:\n\n- 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\n- When 0 is added alone \u2192 1 blicket (odd) \u2192 light on. But in the initial step, light was off. Contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket and the total number of objects is even. Let's test:\n\n- Adding 0 (1 object, 1 blicket): 1 is odd \u2192 light off.\n\n- Adding 1 (2 objects, 1 blicket): even objects, 1 blicket \u2192 light on? But in step 2, after adding 1, light was still off. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is even. So:\n\n- Adding 0 (1 blicket) \u2192 odd \u2192 off.\n\n- Adding 2 (now 2 blickets) \u2192 even \u2192 on.\n\n- Removing 0 (1 blicket) \u2192 odd \u2192 off.\n\n- Adding 0 again (2 blickets) \u2192 even \u2192 on.\n\nThen, later, when 0 is added with 4 (assuming 4 is not a blicket), the machine has 0 (1 blicket) \u2192 odd \u2192 off. But when 0 is added again (redundant), maybe the count is still 1 \u2192 off. But according to the steps, the light turns on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to focus on which objects are blickets based on the steps where the light turned on:\n\n1. Adding 2 to 0 and 1 \u2192 light on. So 2 is a blicket.\n\n2. Adding 0 to 4 \u2192 light on. So 0 is a blicket.\n\nThus, objects 0 and 2 are blickets. Now, the question is about object 1: is it a blicket?\n\nIn the steps where 1 was on the machine with 0 and 2, the light was on. But when 1 and 2 were on (after removing 0), the light was off. Since 2 is a blicket, the machine should be on if 2 is present. Unless 1 somehow cancels it. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the rule requires that all objects on the machine are blickets. So if any non-blicket is present, the machine is off. \n\nIf that's the case, then when 0,1,2 are on (assuming 1 is not a blicket), the machine would be off. But in the steps, adding 2 made it on. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if any subset of the blickets are present. So 0 and 2 are blickets. Whenever at least one is present, the machine is on. But in the initial step, 0 alone was off. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but in the later step, when 0 is added with 4 (non-blicket), the light turns on. So 0 is a blicket, and even with a non-blicket, the machine is on. So the rule is that having at least one blicket activates the machine. But then why in the initial step, adding 0 alone didn't activate it. That's a contradiction. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that the machine activates when a blicket is added. So placing a blicket on the machine turns it on, and removing it turns it off. But:\n\n- Adding 0 (a blicket) \u2192 light on. But in step 1, adding 0 didn't turn it on. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the machine activates when a new blicket is added, but stays on as long as at least one blicket is present. So:\n\n- Adding 0 (first blicket) \u2192 light on. But step 1 shows it's off. So no.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a educated guess based on the evidence. \n\nFrom the steps, object 2 caused the light to turn on when added to 0 and 1. Object 0 later caused the light to turn on when added to 4. This suggests that both 0 and 2 are blickets. The rule might be that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. However, the initial step where 0 alone didn't activate is conflicting. But perhaps there was a mistake in the steps. For example, maybe when the user put 0 on the machine initially, it was off, but later, when 0 was put on again, it was on. This could mean that the machine's state depends on some other factor, like the order of placement. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it activates if the sum of the blicket IDs is even. For 0, sum is 0 \u2192 even (on). For 2, sum is 2 \u2192 even (on). For 0 and 2, sum is 2 \u2192 even (on). This fits with the later steps where 0 and 2 are on \u2192 light on. When 0 was first added alone, sum 0 \u2192 even, light should be on. But in the initial step, it was off. This discrepancy suggests this isn't the rule.\n\nAnother angle: When the user put 0 on the machine after 4, the light turned on. This indicates that 0 is a blicket. So the initial step where 0 alone didn't activate must be due to an error in my understanding. Maybe the initial step where 0 was added alone didn't activate because the machine requires at least two blickets. But later, when 0 was added with 2, it worked. But then, in the later step, 0 alone was sufficient. So this is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the initial steps were affected by other objects. For example, maybe object 6 was a blicket and was initially on the machine. But the user took it off, so when they added 0, the light was off. But if 0 is a blicket, then adding it should turn the light on. But it didn't. So maybe object 6 was a blicket, and the machine requires it to be present. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the evidence that 0 and 2 are blickets. Object 1 was on the machine in various steps but never caused the light to turn on by itself. For example, when 1 and 2 were on the machine, the light was off. Since 2 is a blicket, if 1 were a blicket, the light should be on (if the rule is at least one), but it was off. So 1 is not a blicket."}

So, the machine turns on when certain objects (blickets) are placed on it. From the actions taken during the game, let me recap what happened step by step.\n\nInitially, objects 0,1,2,3,4,5,7 were on the floor, and 6 was on the machine. But the first action was taking 6 off, so then the machine had nothing. Then they put 0,1,2 on the machine. When 2 was added, the machine turned on. Then taking 2 off turned it off, and putting it back on turned it on again. Later, when they took 0 and 1 off, leaving just 2, the machine was off. Wait, no. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, after putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light turned on. Then taking 2 off turned it off. Then putting 2 back on turned it on again. Then they took 0 and 1 off (so only 2 was left), and the machine went off. Wait, but that contradicts. Hmm. Wait, let me look again.\n\nHere's the sequence:\n\n1. After taking object 6 off, the machine is empty. Light is off.\n\n2. Put 0 on: light off.\n\n3. Put 1 on: still off.\n\n4. Put 2 on: light turns on. So with 0,1,2 on the machine, the light is on.\n\n5. Take 2 off: light turns off. Now machine has 0,1.\n\n6. Put 2 back on: light turns on again (machine has 0,1,2). So the presence of 2 seems to make it turn on.\n\n7. Then take 0 off: light turns off (machine has 1,2). Wait, but then taking 0 off (from 0,1,2 on the machine) would leave 1 and 2. If the light was on with 0,1,2, and removing 0 causes it to turn off, that suggests that 0's presence was necessary. But earlier, adding 2 made it turn on when 0 and 1 were already on. Hmm, maybe the rule is that at least two blickets are needed? Or maybe object 2 is a blicket and another one.\n\nWait, let's see another part. Later, after removing 0 and 1 (so machine is empty), they put 3 on: light off. Then 4 on: light off. Then 0 and 4 on, then take 4 off, leaving 0 on. Then the light was on. Wait, when 0 was put on again with 4, the light turned on. Then taking 4 off left 0, and the light stayed on. That suggests that 0 is a blicket, perhaps? Because when only 0 is on the machine, the light is on.\n\nBut wait, earlier, when 0 and 1 were on the machine (without 2), the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. Then removing 2 turned it off. Then adding 2 again turned it on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) turned it off. Then taking 1 off (leaving 2) didn't do anything, but machine was already off. Then putting 2 on again (but it was already on?), which the system said object 2 is already on the machine, but light was off. Then putting 4 on (machine has 2 and 4?), but light stays off. Then putting 0 on (machine has 0,2,4?), light turns on. Then taking 4 off (leaves 0 and 2) and light stays on. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if the sum of the blickets' \"blicktness\" meets a certain condition, like an odd number or something. Or perhaps a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWhen 0,1,2 were on the machine, light on. Then taking 2 off (leaving 0 and 1), light off. Then putting 2 back on (0,1,2), light on. Then taking 0 off (1 and 2), light off. Then taking 1 off (only 2), light off. So when only 2 is present, it's off. When 2 and 1 are present, off. When 0,1,2 are present, on. Then later, when 0 is put on the machine alone, light turns on. Wait, no: after putting 0 on machine (step after taking 3 off), then put 4 on, then 0 again. Wait, the last steps:\n\nAfter some steps, the user put 0 on the machine (machine had 0,4?), and the light turned on. Then took 4 off, leaving 0, and the light stayed on. So 0 alone can activate the machine. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on the machine (without 2), the light was off. So that's conflicting. So how does that work?\n\nWait, maybe there's a timing or order issue. Let me retrace the steps carefully.\n\nInitial state after taking 6 off: all objects except 6 are on floor.\n\n- put 0 on: machine has 0. Light off.\n\n- put 1 on: machine has 0,1. Light off.\n\n- put 2 on: machine has 0,1,2. Light turns on.\n\nSo in this case, adding 2 caused activation. So perhaps 2 is a blicket, but requires at least one more? Or maybe 2 and another.\n\nThen take 2 off: machine has 0,1. Light off. Then put 2 back: machine has 0,1,2. Light on. So presence of 2 is key here.\n\nThen take 0 off: machine has 1,2. Light off. So with 1 and 2, it's off. Then take 1 off: machine has 2. Light off. So 2 alone doesn't activate.\n\nThen put 3 on: machine has 3. Light off.\n\nTake 3 off. Then put 2 on, but it was already on (maybe a mistake here?), but light is off. Then put 4 on: machine has 2,4. Light off.\n\nPut 0 on: machine has 0,2,4. Light turns on. Then take 4 off: machine has 0,2. Light stays on.\n\nSo when 0 and 2 are on, the machine is on. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on, adding 2 made it on. Then when 0 and 2 are present (after removing 4), the machine is on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, the machine was off. So perhaps 0 and 2 together activate the machine. So maybe both are blickets. Because when they are both present, the machine is on. For example, in the last steps, with 0 and 2 on, the machine is on. But when 0 was on with 1 and 2, it was on. Then when 0 was taken off, leaving 1 and 2, it turned off. So maybe the rule is that at least one of the blickets is needed, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the rule could be that exactly objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and the machine turns on when both are present. Let's check.\n\nWhen 0 and 2 are on the machine together (with or without others?), does the machine turn on?\n\nIn the first case, adding 2 to 0 and 1 turned it on. Then when 0 was removed (leaving 1 and 2), it turned off. Then when 0 was added again with 2 and 4, it turned on. Then removing 4 (leaving 0 and 2) kept it on. So whenever 0 and 2 are on, regardless of others, the machine is on. If that's the case, then 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on if both are present. But wait, in the first test when 0 was added alone, it didn't activate. Then when 0 and 2 are added, it does. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. But how about when 0 and 2 are on with others? It still works. So the rule could be that both 0 and 2 are blickets, and the machine requires at least both to be present.\n\nBut wait, in the last step, after putting 0 on with 2 and 4, the machine was on. Then removing 4 (leaving 0 and 2) kept it on. So that supports the idea that 0 and 2 are both blickets. Then, in the first experiment, when 0,1,2 were on, it was on. When 0 and 2 are present, it's on regardless of others. But why did the machine turn on when 0 and 2 were added with 4? Because 4 is not a blicket, but since 0 and 2 are present, it still activates. So the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets (which are 0 and 2) are present. Wait, but that's a specific rule. Alternatively, the machine activates if any blicket is present, but in this case, the blickets are 0 and 2, but that doesn't fit because when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if the sum of the blickets' \"blicktness\" is at least a certain number. For example, each blicket contributes 1, and the threshold is 2. Then, 0 and 2 are blickets. So when they're both on, the sum is 2, which meets the threshold. But when 0 is alone, sum is 1, which doesn't. Then when 0,2, and others are on, sum is 2, so it activates. That fits. Let's check the steps:\n\n- 0,1,2: sum is 2 (0 and 2 are blickets), so activates.\n\n- Take 0 off: sum is 1 (only 2), so deactivates.\n\n- Take 1 off: sum remains 1 (only 2), off.\n\n- Later, putting 0 and 2 on: sum 2, activates.\n\nSo that fits. Then, when 0,2,4 are on: sum 2, activates. Removing 4 (sum still 2) remains on.\n\nBut then what about the step where putting 0 on after 4 was on? Let's check:\n\nAfter some steps, they put 4 on the machine (machine has 4). Light off. Then put 0 on (machine has 4 and 0). Light turns on. Because sum of blickets (0 and 2) would be 1 (only 0 is on), but that's not enough. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, in that step, after putting 4 on, machine has 4. Then put 0 on: machine has 0 and 4. Light turns on. According to the previous logic, if 0 is a blicket and 4 is not, then sum is 1, which shouldn't activate. But in that case, the light turned on. So that's a problem. So maybe my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the exact steps again:\n\nAfter taking object 3 off, the user tried to put object 2 on the machine, but it was already on. Then they put object 4 on the machine (machine has 2 and 4?), but the light is off. Then put object 0 on machine (machine has 0,2,4?), light turns on. Then take 4 off (machine has 0,2), light stays on.\n\nSo in this case, when 0 is added to 2 and 4, the light turns on. If 0 and 2 are both blickets, their sum is 2, which meets the threshold. But earlier, when 0 was added alone (0 on machine), light was off. Then when 0 and 4 are added (assuming 4 is not a blicket), sum is 1 (only 0), which shouldn't activate. But in the step where they put 0 on after 4, the light turned on. Wait, no, let me check the exact sequence again.\n\nWait, after taking object 3 off:\n\n- put object 2 on machine: system says object 2 is already on the machine (maybe a confusion here, perhaps previous steps left 2 on?), but light is off. Then the user puts object 4 on machine: machine has 2 and 4. Light off. Then puts object 0 on machine: machine has 0,2,4. Light turns on. Then take 4 off: machine has 0 and 2. Light stays on.\n\nSo in this case, adding 0 to 2 and 4 caused activation. So sum of 0 and 2 (assuming they are blickets) is 2, which meets the threshold. So that fits. But earlier, when 0 was alone, sum is 1, which doesn't activate. But when 0 is added with 4 (non-blicket), sum is 1, but in that step, when they put 0 on the machine (which already had 4), the light turned on. Wait, no, in the steps:\n\nThe user did:\n\nput object 4 on machine (machine has 4, light off)\n\nput object 0 on machine (now machine has 0 and 4, light turns on). But according to previous logic, if 0 is a blicket and 4 isn't, then sum is 1 (only 0), which shouldn't activate. So this is conflicting. Therefore, my previous assumption that 0 and 2 are blickets with sum >=2 is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. But in that case, when 0 was alone, the machine should have turned on. But in the first step after putting 0 on, it was off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if an odd number of blickets are present. Let's test that.\n\nSuppose blickets are 0 and 2.\n\n- 0 alone: 1 (odd) \u2192 should activate. But in the first step, it didn't.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that exactly one blicket is present. But when 0 and 2 are both on, it's two, which would deactivate. But in the steps, when both are on, the machine is on.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when 0 is alone, it should activate. But in the first step, putting 0 on didn't activate. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the steps where 0 is added with 4:\n\nPut 4 on \u2192 machine has 4 (light off)\n\nPut 0 on \u2192 machine has 0 and 4 (light on)\n\nIf 0 is a blicket, then having 0 on should activate the machine regardless of others. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it didn't. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding of the steps. Let me check again:\n\nAfter taking object 3 off, the user tried to put object 2 on the machine, but it was already there. Then they put object 4 on machine (machine has 2 and 4, since 2 was already on?), but light is off. Then put object 0 on machine (machine now has 0,2,4?), light turns on. Then take 4 off, leaving 0 and 2. Light stays on.\n\nWait, but in this case, when 0 is added to 2 and 4, light turns on. If the rule is that 2 is a blicket, then when 2 is present, the machine is on. But earlier, when 2 was alone, the machine was off. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine turns on when 2 is present along with any other object. But when 2 was with 1 and 0, it turned on. When 2 was with 0 and 4, it turned on. But when 2 was alone or with 1, it was off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on it, and at least one is a blicket. But when 0 and 4 are on (assuming 0 is a blicket), then two objects, one blicket \u2192 machine on. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on (two objects, but only 0 is a blicket), the machine was off. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to list all the configurations where the machine was on or off:\n\n1. Machine has 0: off.\n\n2. Machine has 0,1: off.\n\n3. Machine has 0,1,2: on.\n\n4. Machine has 0,1 (after removing 2): off.\n\n5. Machine has 1,2 (after removing 0): off.\n\n6. Machine has 2: off.\n\n7. Machine has 3: off.\n\n8. Machine has 4: off.\n\n9. Machine has 4,0: on.\n\n10. Machine has 0,2,4: on.\n\n11. Machine has 0,2: on.\n\nSo from this, when 0 and 4 are on, machine is on. When 0 and 2 are on, it's on. When 0,1,2 are on, it's on. When 0,2,4 are on, it's on. When 0 is alone, off. When 2 is alone, off. When 0 and 4 are on, on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is present along with at least one other object. But why does that work?\n\nWait, when 0 is present with 1 and 2: on.\n\n0 with 1: off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on when 0 and 2 are present, regardless of others. But when 0 and 4 are present, it's on. Unless 4 is also a blicket. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of objects on it is even. But:\n\n- 3 objects (0,1,2): odd \u2192 on? No, in the first test it's on. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's check the parity:\n\n- 0: 1 object \u2192 odd. Off.\n\n- 0,1: 2 \u2192 even. Off.\n\n- 0,1,2: 3 \u2192 odd. On.\n\n- 1,2: 2 \u2192 even. Off.\n\n- 0,4: 2 \u2192 even. On.\n\n- 0,2,4: 3 \u2192 odd. On.\n\n- 0,2: 2 \u2192 even. On.\n\nSo parity doesn't fit. So that's not the rule.\n\nAnother approach: look for the minimal cases where the machine turns on. The first time it turns on is when 0,1,2 are added. Then taking 2 off turns it off. Putting 2 back on turns it on. So 2 is critical. But when 2 is alone, it's off. So maybe 2 needs to be with at least one other blicket. For example, if 2 and 0 are both blickets, then when either is present with the other, the machine turns on. Wait, but when 0 is added with 4, the machine turns on. Unless 4 is also a blicket. But then why when 4 is alone, it's off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if the sum of the object numbers is even. But:\n\n- 0+1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 on. Doesn't fit.\n\n- 0+4=4 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0+2=2 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0+2+4=6 (even) \u2192 on.\n\nBut earlier cases:\n\n0 alone (0 even) \u2192 off.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then:\n\n- 0,1,2: two blickets (0 and 2) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,4: one blicket (0) \u2192 off. But in the step where 0 and 4 are on, the machine was on. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0,2, and 4 are blickets. But when 4 is alone, machine is off. When 4 is with 0, it's on. So that would require at least two blickets. But then when 0 and 4 are on, two blickets \u2192 on. When 0 and 2 are on \u2192 two blickets \u2192 on. But then when 0 is alone \u2192 one blicket \u2192 off. So the rule could be that at least two blickets must be present. But in that case, when 0,2,4 are on (three blickets?), the machine is on. But when 0 and 4 are on (two blickets?), it's on. When 0 and 2 are on (two) \u2192 on. But if 4 is a blicket, then when 4 is alone, it's off. So that fits. But how do we know if 4 is a blicket?\n\nBut in the step where they put 0 and 4 on, the machine turns on. If 4 is a blicket, then that's two blickets (0 and 4), so machine turns on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it was off, and when 4 was alone, it was off. So if the rule is that at least two blickets are needed, then 0,2,4 are all blickets. But then when they put 0 and 4 on, two blickets \u2192 machine on. When they put 0 and 2 on, two blickets \u2192 on. When 0,2,4 are on, three \u2192 still on. But when they put 0,1,2 on, which includes two blickets (0,2), machine on. This fits. Then in the step where they put 0 and 4 on, it's two blickets \u2192 on. But when they put 4 alone, it's off. So 4 would be a blicket. But why in the step where they put 0 and 4, the light turns on. So this would suggest that 0 and 4 are blickets, but also 2. But how does that fit with earlier steps?\n\nWait, but when 0,1,2 are on, and the machine is on, that would require that at least two blickets are present. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then two \u2192 on. That works. Then when 0 and 4 are on, if 4 is not a blicket, then only one \u2192 off. But in the steps, when 0 and 4 are on, the machine turns on. So that would mean that 4 is a blicket. But earlier, putting 4 alone didn't activate. So if 4 is a blicket, then when alone, it's one \u2192 off. When with 0 (another blicket), two \u2192 on. So that fits. But then, in the step where they put 0 and 4 on, machine on. So that would mean 0 and 4 are blickets. But earlier, when they put 2 on with 0 and 1, machine turned on. So 2 would also be a blicket. So maybe there are three blickets: 0,2,4. But then when 0,2 are on, two blickets \u2192 on. When 0,4 are on \u2192 two \u2192 on. When 2,4 are on \u2192 two \u2192 on. But when 2 and 4 are on, in the steps:\n\nAfter putting 2 and 4 on, the machine was off. Because in the steps:\n\nAfter taking object 3 off, the user tried to put 2 on, but it was already on. Then put 4 on (machine has 2 and 4), light off. Then put 0 on (machine has 0,2,4), light on. So if 2 and 4 are blickets, then putting them both on should activate the machine (two blickets). But in that step, with 2 and 4 on, the light was off. So that contradicts. Therefore, 4 cannot be a blicket.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find the minimal case where adding an object turns the machine on.\n\nFirst time the machine turns on: adding 2 to 0 and 1. Then removing 2 turns it off. So 2 is critical here. Then adding 2 back turns it on. So 2 is a blicket. Then, when 0 and 1 are removed, leaving 2 alone, the machine is off. So 2 alone isn't enough. Then, when 0 is added back with 4 and 2, the machine is on. Taking 4 off leaves 0 and 2 \u2192 machine stays on. So 0 and 2 together activate. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it didn't. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when both 0 and 2 are present. But in the step where 0 and 4 are on, the machine turns on. Unless 4 is also a blicket. But that contradicts previous steps. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when any two objects are present, but only if at least one is a blicket. But that doesn't fit with some steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 is present. But when 2 is alone, it's off. When 2 is with others, it's on. So maybe 2 is a blicket and needs to be with at least one other object. But then, when 2 is with 1, which is not a blicket, the machine would activate. But in the step where 1 and 2 are on, the machine was off. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, let's look at the step where the machine turned on with 0,2,4 on. Then removing 4 leaves 0 and 2 \u2192 on. So that suggests that 0 and 2 are sufficient. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it was off. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. But then in the step where 0 and 4 are on, the machine turns on. So that would require that 4 is a blicket and 0 and 4 are required. But that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is odd. Let's suppose 0 and 2 are blickets. Then:\n\n- 0 alone: 1 (odd) \u2192 on. But in step 1, it was off.\n\nConflict.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. If 0 and 2 are blickets:\n\n- 0 and 2 \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 on (two blickets).\n\n- 0 and 4 \u2192 off (only one blicket).\n\nBut in the step where 0 and 4 are on, the machine was on. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the blickets' IDs is even. If blickets are 0,2,4 (even IDs), then sum of their presence:\n\n- 0 alone: 0 (even) \u2192 on. But in step 1, it's off.\n\nConflict.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when there is at least one blicket, and the total number of objects is even. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all observations:\n\nWhen the machine is on:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 \u2192 on (when added back after removal).\n\nWait, when 2 was added back after being removed, the machine had 0,1,2 \u2192 on. Then when 0 and 1 are removed, leaving 2 \u2192 off. Then when 0 is added with 4 \u2192 on.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when object 0 is present along with any other object. Because:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n\n- 0 and 1: off. No, because in that case, machine has 0 and 1 \u2192 off.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when object 2 is present and at least one other object is also present. So:\n\n- 2 alone: off.\n\n- 2 with others: on.\n\nBut in the step where 0,1,2 are present \u2192 on.\n\nWhen 2 is removed \u2192 off.\n\nWhen 2 is added back \u2192 on.\n\nWhen 0 and 1 are removed, leaving 2 \u2192 off.\n\nWhen 0 and 2 are present \u2192 on.\n\nWhen 0,2,4 are present \u2192 on.\n\nWhen 0 and 4 are present \u2192 on. But according to this rule, if 0 is not a blicket, then the presence of 2 and any other would activate. But in the step where 0 and 4 are present (without 2), the machine turned on. So that would require that 0 is a blicket, but that contradicts when 0 was alone.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to list all the cases where the machine turned on and what was present:\n\n1. 0,1,2 \u2192 on.\n\n2. 0,2,4 \u2192 on.\n\n3. 0,2 \u2192 on.\n\n4. 0,4 \u2192 on.\n\nSo in all these cases, 0 is present, and at least one other object. But when 0 is alone, it's off. When 0 and 1 are present, it's off. So the presence of 0 plus certain other objects activates the machine. This suggests that the other objects might be blickets, but only when combined with 0. For example, if 2 and 4 are blickets, then:\n\n- 0 + 2 (blicket) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 + 4 (blicket) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 + 2 + 4 \u2192 on.\n\nBut 2 alone \u2192 off. 4 alone \u2192 off.\n\nSo the rule could be that the machine turns on when 0 is present along with at least one blicket (2 or 4). In this case, 2 and 4 are blickets, and 0 is a necessary component. But why would 0 be required? Like a base object. So the rule is that the machine activates if 0 is present and at least one blicket (2 or 4) is also present.\n\nBut then, when 0 and 2 are on \u2192 activate. 0 and 4 \u2192 activate. 0,2,4 \u2192 activate. When 0 is alone \u2192 no. When 2 is alone \u2192 no. This fits. But why in the first step when 0 and 1 are on, it's off. Because 1 is not a blicket. So that fits. But in the step where 0 and 4 are on, the machine is on. So if 4 is a blicket, then yes. But earlier steps didn't test 4 alone. So perhaps 2 and 4 are blickets, and 0 is a required component. So the rule is: machine activates if 0 is present along with any blicket (2 or 4).\n\nBut then, how about when 0 is present with 2 and 4: it's on. If both 2 and 4 are blickets, that still fits. But what about when 0,2, and a non-blicket (like 1) are present: it's on (as in the first case). That would also fit.\n\nBut in the step where they put 0 and 4 on (assuming 4 is a blicket), machine turns on. But when they put 4 alone, it's off. So 4 is a blicket only when 0 is present. That's possible? Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's a pair of objects, where one is 0 and the other is a blicket (2 or 4). So the blickets are 2 and 4, but they only work when paired with 0. So when 0 and 2 are on, machine on. When 0 and 4 are on, machine on. When 2 alone, off. When 4 alone, off. When 0 alone, off. When 0 and 1, off. That fits all the observations.\n\nSo the blickets would be 2 and 4. But in the step where they put 0,2,4 on the machine, the machine is on. Because 0 is paired with 2 and 4. But according to this rule, any pairing of 0 with a blicket activates it. So even with multiple blickets, it's on.\n\nBut the user's question is whether object 2 is a blicket. According to this hypothesis, 2 is a blicket. Because when paired with 0, it activates. And when 0 is added to 2 and 4, it activates. So 2 is a blicket. But what about the step where 0 and 4 are on: if 4 is a blicket, then yes. So 2 and 4 are blickets, and 0 is required as a base.\n\nBut this requires that the rule is 0 must be present along with a blicket. However, how do we know that 4 is a blicket? Because when they put 0 and 4 on, the machine turns on. So according to the rule, 4 must be a blicket. But when they put 4 alone, it's off, which fits. So yes, 4 is a blicket only when paired with 0.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complex. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if object 0 is present along with any other object. But when 0 and 1 are present, it's off. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if object 0 is present and at least one other object with an even ID. For example:\n\n- 0 and 2 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 and 4 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 includes 2 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 and 1 (both odd?) \u2192 off.\n\nBut 0 is even, 1 is odd, 2 even. But in this case, when 0 and 1 are present, the other object is 1 (odd), so off. When 0 and 2 \u2192 even, on. This fits. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when 0 is present and at least one even-numbered object (2,4,6, etc.) is also present. Since the objects are 0-7, the even ones are 0,2,4,6. But 0 is already part of the rule. So the rule is: machine activates if 0 is present along with any even-numbered object (other than 0). But 0 is even, but being present with itself (only 0) doesn't activate. So the rule could be 0 plus another even-numbered object.\n\nLet's test this:\n\n- 0 and 2 \u2192 even and even \u2192 on. Yes.\n\n- 0 and 4 \u2192 on. Yes.\n\n- 0,2,4 \u2192 on. Yes.\n\n- 0 and 1 \u2192 off. Yes.\n\n- 0 alone \u2192 off.\n\n- 2 alone \u2192 off.\n\n- 4 alone \u2192 off.\n\n- 0 and 6 \u2192 on (but 6 was taken off early on).\n\nThis fits all the observations. So the rule is that the machine turns on if object 0 and at least one other even-numbered object (2,4,6) are present. Then the blickets would be all even-numbered objects except 0. Or wait, maybe the blickets are the even-numbered objects, but the rule requires 0 plus any blicket. But according to the problem statement, blickets have \"blicktness\" that makes the machine turn on following a rule. So the rule might not directly depend on their numbers but their properties. But according to this hypothesis, the blickets are objects 2 and 4 (even numbers), and the rule is that 0 must be present along with a blicket. But why would 0 need to be present? It's part of the rule, but not a blicket. So perhaps the blickets are 2 and 4, and the rule is that the machine activates when 0 is present along with any blicket. Therefore, 0 is not a blicket, but a required component. But according to the problem statement, the blickets are the ones with \"blicktness\" that make the machine turn on. So if the rule requires 0 plus a blicket, then 0 isn't a blicket, but the blickets are 2 and 4. So in that case, object 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut how do we know this? Because when 0 and 2 are on, the machine is on. So 2 must be a blicket. And when 0 and 4 are on, the machine is on, so 4 is a blicket. But earlier steps didn't test 4 alone. But according to the given steps, when 0 and 4 are on, machine is on. So according to this rule, 4 is a blicket. But the user's question is whether object 2 is a blicket. In this case, yes. Because when 0 and 2 are present, the machine activates. So the rule requires 0 plus a blicket. Therefore, 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut another possibility is that the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the object IDs is even. For example:\n\n- 0+2=2 \u2192 even \u2192 on.\n\n- 0+4=4 \u2192 even \u2192 on.\n\n- 0+1+2=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 but in the steps, this was on. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Back to the earlier hypothesis: the rule is that the machine activates when object 0 is present along with any even-numbered object (2,4,6). Therefore, the blickets are 2,4,6, and the rule is that 0 must be present with a blicket. But 6 was removed early on and not tested again. But according to the steps, when object 6 was on the machine initially, the light was off. So maybe 6 is not a blicket. Therefore, perhaps the blickets are 2 and 4, and the rule is that the machine activates when 0 is present with either 2 or 4.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the blickets have \"blicktness\" that causes the machine to turn on. So if the rule is that 0 must be present with a blicket, then 0 is not a blicket, but a necessary component. But according to the problem, the machine's rule depends solely on the blickets. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 two blickets \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,2 \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,4 \u2192 if 0 and 4 are blickets \u2192 two \u2192 on.\n\nBut when 0 is alone \u2192 off. When 4 is alone \u2192 off. When 0 and 4 are on \u2192 two \u2192 on. But according to the steps, when 0 and 4 are on, it's on. So if 0 and 4 are blickets, that fits. But earlier, when 0 and 1 are on \u2192 off (only one blicket). This would work if the rule is that at least two blickets are needed. But then, in the steps where 0,2,4 are on \u2192 three blickets \u2192 on. But how do we determine if 4 is a blicket? The step where putting 0 and 4 on \u2192 on. So if the rule is at least two blickets, then both 0 and 4 would have to be blickets. But when 0 is alone, it's off. So 0 is a blicket. But then, the step where 0 and 4 are on \u2192 two blickets \u2192 on. But when 0 is alone \u2192 one \u2192 off. So that fits.\n\nBut then, when 0 and 2 are on (if both are blickets), two \u2192 on. When 0,2,4 are on \u2192 three \u2192 on. When 0 and 4 are on \u2192 two \u2192 on. So in this case, 0,2,4 are blickets. But earlier, putting 0 and 1 on \u2192 one blicket \u2192 off. Putting 0,1,2 \u2192 two blickets \u2192 on. This fits.\n\nBut in the step where they put 0 and 4 on, the machine turns on. So according to this, 0 and 4 are blickets. Then, the answer to whether object 2 is a blicket would depend on whether 2 is also a blicket. Since in the step where 0 and 2 are on, the machine is on, which would require that both are blickets. So object 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut wait, if the rule is that at least two blickets are needed, then:\n\n- When 0 and 2 are on, if both are blickets \u2192 machine on.\n\n- When 0 and 4 are on \u2192 machine on (both blickets).\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on \u2192 two blickets (0 and 2) \u2192 on.\n\n- When 0 is alone \u2192 off.\n\n- When 2 is alone \u2192 off.\n\n- When 4 is alone \u2192 off.\n\nBut then, when 0 and 4 are on, the machine is on, meaning both are blickets. But according to the step where they put 0 and 4 on, the machine turns on. So in this scenario, 0 and 4 are blickets. But earlier, when 0 and 2 are on, the machine is on, so 0 and 2 are blickets. Therefore, 0,2,4 are all blickets. But when 0 is added to 2,4 \u2192 three blickets \u2192 on. When 0 and 4 are on \u2192 two \u2192 on. When 0 and 2 \u2192 two \u2192 on. When 0 is alone \u2192 one \u2192 off.\n\nBut in the step where 0 and 4 are on, the machine is on. So 0 and 4 must both be blickets. Therefore, object 2 would also be a blicket because when 0 and 2 are on, the machine is on. So the answer is yes, object 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut then why in the step where 0 and 4 are on, the machine is on. So 0,4 are blickets. And 0,2 are blickets. So 0 is a blicket, and 2 and 4 are blickets. Then the rule is that at least two blickets are required. But then, when 0 and 4 are on \u2192 two \u2192 on. When 0 and 2 \u2192 two \u2192 on. When 0,2,4 \u2192 three \u2192 on. When 0 alone \u2192 one \u2192 off. When 4 alone \u2192 one \u2192 off. This fits all observations.\n\nTherefore, the blickets are 0,2,4. But in the first step when 0 was added alone, the machine was off. Because only one blicket. But then when 0 and 4 are added (two blickets), it's on. So yes. But the problem says that the blickets have blicktness inside them, and the machine's rule is based on that. So the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket."}

Then, they started adding objects 0, 1, and 2. When they added 0 and 1, the light stayed off. But when they added 2 after that, the light turned on. Then they removed 2, and the light went off. Putting 2 back on made it turn on again. So that suggests that object 2 is a blicket because adding it causes the machine to activate. \n\nNext, when they removed 0 and 1, leaving only 2, the light was off, which is confusing. Wait, no, when they took 0 and 1 off, they had already taken 2 off earlier. Wait, let me recheck the steps. \n\nWait, the sequence was: \n- Put 0, 1, then 2. Light turns on. \n- Take 2 off, light off. \n- Put 2 back on, light on. \n- Then take 0 and 1 off, which were on the machine. So after removing 0 and 1, the machine still had 2 on it. Wait, no. Wait, after putting 0,1,2 on, light on. Then take 2 off (light off). Then put 2 back (light on). Then take 0 off (so machine has 1 and 2?), then take 1 off (machine has only 2?), and then the light turns off? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when they took 0 off, machine had 1 and 2. Then took 1 off, so only 2 remains. But the light went off. But previously, putting 2 alone turned the light on. Hmm, maybe there's a different rule here. Maybe the machine requires multiple blickets to be present. \n\nWait, let's re-examine the steps carefully:\n\n1. After putting 0,1,2 on, machine turns on. Then take 2 off (light off). Put 2 back on (light on). Then take 0 off (machine has 1 and 2). Light was on? Wait, no. When they took 0 off, the light turned off. Because after taking 0 off, the next step was taking 1 off, and the light was off. Wait, maybe the machine requires a combination. Let's track each step:\n\n- Start: All objects on floor except 6 (which was taken off first).\n- After putting 0,1,2 on machine: light on. So 0,1,2 together activate.\n- Take 2 off: light off. So removing 2 deactivates.\n- Put 2 back on: light on. So 0,1,2 again activate.\n- Take 0 off: machine now has 1 and 2. Light turns off. So 1 and 2 together don't activate it. Therefore, maybe the presence of 0 is required. But earlier, when 0,1,2 were on, it worked. Then when 0 was removed, even though 1 and 2 are present, it didn't. But when they later put 0 and 4 on, and then took 4 off, leaving 0, the light stayed on. Wait, let's check that step.\n\nAnother part: After removing 0 and 1 (so machine has only 2), they then tried adding 3 (no effect), 4 (no effect), and then put 0 on again. When they put 0 on (machine had 0,2,4?), wait no. Let's check the steps again:\n\nAfter taking 0 and 1 off (machine has only 2?), then:\n\nThey put 3 on machine: light off. Then take 3 off. Then try to put 2 again (but it's already there). Then put 4 on machine (machine has 2 and 4), light off. Then put 0 on (machine has 0, 2, 4). Light turns on. Then take 4 off (machine has 0 and 2), light stays on. \n\nSo here, when 0 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. So that suggests that 0 and 2 together activate the machine. Because when 0,2,4 were on, light was on. Taking 4 off leaves 0 and 2, and light stays on. So perhaps the rule is that at least two blickets are present. But which ones?\n\nFrom the first tests: Adding 0 and 1 didn't activate. Adding 2 made it activate. Then when 0 and 2 were present, it activated. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and 0 is also a blicket. Because when 0 and 2 are together, it works. But when 2 alone is there (after taking 0 and 1 off), the light was off. Wait, but in the step where they took 0 and 1 off (after putting 0,1,2 on and the light was on), taking 0 off first: machine has 1 and 2. Then taking 1 off, machine has only 2. But the light was off. So 2 alone doesn't activate. But when they later added 0 and 2, it did. So perhaps the rule is that both 0 and 2 are blickets, and the machine requires at least two blickets to be present. So when 0 and 2 are together, it's on. When 2 is alone, it's off. \n\nThen, when they put 0 and 4 on, then took 4 off, leaving 0 and 2, the light stayed on. So 4 isn't a blicket, but 0 and 2 are. \n\nNow, about object 3: The user put object 3 on the machine, and the light remained off. Then took it off. Since the machine didn't activate when 3 was added (either alone or with others?), but the only test with 3 was when it was put alone on the machine (after 2 was on the machine? Wait, no. Wait, after taking 0 and 1 off, they put 3 on the machine. At that time, the machine had 2 on it. So adding 3 to 2: machine has 2 and 3. Light was off. Then they took 3 off, leaving 2. Then tried putting 2 again (but it was already there). Then put 4 on (2 and 4), light off. Then put 0 on (0,2,4), light on. \n\nSo when 2 and 3 were on the machine, light was off. But when 0 and 2 are on, light is on. So 3 doesn't contribute to activating the machine. Therefore, 3 is not a blicket. \n\nSo the answer should be False."}

So, the machine turns on based on some rule involving the blickets.

Then, removing 2 turned it off. Putting 2 back on turned it on again. That suggests that object 2 is a blicket because when it's on the machine, the light is on.

Wait, no\u2014let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, initial state: after putting 0, 1, 2 on machine, the light turns on when 2 is added. Then when they took 2 off, the light went off. Then putting 2 back on made it turn on again. Then they took 0 and 1 off (so only 2 is left?), but the light went off? Wait, no. Let me check the exact sequence:\n\nAfter putting 0, 1, 2 on machine, the light turns on. Then they take 2 off, light turns off. Then put 2 back on, light on. Then take 0 off (so machine has 1 and 2?), light off. Then take 1 off (machine empty?), light off. Then they put 3 on, light off. Then 3 off. Then tried to put 2 on again (but it was already on?), but the light was off. Wait, maybe I need to track the machine's state at each step.\n\nWait, step by step:\n\n- After initial steps: object 6 was on the machine but taken off. Then 0,1,2 added one by one. When 2 was added, the light turned on. So with 0,1,2 on the machine, light on.\n\n- Then take 2 off: light off. So with 0 and 1, light is off. Then put 2 back: light on. So with 0,1,2 again, light on.\n\n- Then take 0 off: now machine has 1 and 2. Light off. So even with 2 on, if 0 is removed, light turns off. That suggests that maybe the presence of 0 is required? Wait, but earlier, when 0,1,2 were all on, it was on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) turns it off. Then taking 1 off (leaving just 2) keeps it off. Then putting 2 again (but it was already on? Maybe the user made a mistake here.) But perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Wait, but in the first case, adding 2 made it turn on when 0 and 1 were already on. But then when 2 was removed, it turned off. Then when 2 was added again, it turned on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the machine needs at least one blicket. But when they removed 0 and 1 (leaving only 2), the light stayed on? Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, after putting 0,1,2 on the machine:\n\n- 0 on: light off.\n\n- 1 on: still off.\n\n- 2 on: light turns on. So the presence of 2 caused the light to turn on. Then take 2 off: light off. Then put 2 back: light on. So 2 is definitely a blicket, and the machine turns on when 2 is present. But then when they took 0 off (so 1 and 2 are on), the light turned off. Wait, that contradicts. Because if 2 is a blicket, removing 0 (which was on the machine) shouldn't affect it unless the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present. Let's see:\n\nWhen 0,1,2 are on: maybe among these, two are blickets. Adding 2 made the count reach two. But when they took 2 off, the count went below two. Then putting 2 back, count back to two. Then taking 0 off (assuming 0 is a blicket), the count would drop to one (if 1 is not a blicket). So the light turns off. Then taking 1 off (so only 2 is on), the count is one (if 2 is a blicket), so light remains off. Then putting 3,4, etc., but they don't affect. \n\nWait, but in the next step: they put 0 and 4 on the machine, and the light turns on. Let's look at that step.\n\nAfter putting 0 on machine (machine has 0 and 4), the light is on. Then take 4 off, the light stays on. So if 0 is a blicket, then even when 4 is removed, the machine stays on. That would suggest that 0 is a blicket. But earlier, when 0 was on with 1 and 2, the light was on only after 2 was added. So perhaps 0 and 2 are blickets. Then, when 0 and 4 are on, the machine is on because 0 is a blicket. But then why did the light turn on when 0 and 4 were on? Unless 4 is also a blicket. Wait, but when 4 was on the machine along with 0, the light was on. Then taking 4 off, leaving 0, the light remains on. So that would suggest that 0 is a blicket, and the machine only needs at least one blicket. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on the machine (before adding 2), the light was off. So that contradicts. Unless the rule is that the machine requires a certain number of blickets.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when 0 and 1 were on (assuming they are not blickets), adding 2 (a blicket) turns it on. Then removing 2 turns it off. Then adding 2 again turns it on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) would still have 2, so light should stay on. But in the steps, when 0 was taken off (machine has 1 and 2), the light turned off. So that's confusing. So perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the machine turns on only if all blickets are on the machine. So if 2 is the only blicket, then whenever it's on, the machine is on. But in that case, when 0 was removed (machine has 1 and 2), the light should stay on. But according to the steps, it turned off. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires that all blickets are present on the machine. So if there are multiple blickets, they all need to be on. For example, if 0 and 2 are blickets, then both need to be on the machine. Let's test this:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on: if 0 and 2 are blickets, then both are present, so light on. Then take 2 off: only 0 is present, so light off. Then put 2 back: both on, light on. Then take 0 off: only 2 is present, so light off. Then take 1 off: machine empty, light off. Then put 0 and 4 on: if 0 is a blicket, but 4 is not, then light should be on only if all blickets are present. But if 0 is a blicket and there are others (like 2), then unless all are present, it won't turn on. But in this case, when 0 and 4 are on, the light turns on. So maybe 0 is the only blicket required. But that contradicts earlier steps where 0 alone didn't turn it on. Wait, when they first put 0 on the machine, the light was off. Then added 1, still off. Then added 2, light on. So if the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, then 2 is the only blicket. Then when 0 and 4 are on, the light should be off. But in the later step, putting 0 on machine again (after removing 4), the light turned on. Wait, let's look:\n\nAfter taking 4 off (machine has 0), the light is on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, the light was off. That's a contradiction. So maybe the rule is different. Maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets. Or maybe a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. For example, objects 0 and 2 are blickets. So when both are on, the machine turns on. Let's see:\n\n- 0 and 1: light off (only 0 is a blicket, so one is present: not two).\n\n- Add 2 (0,1,2): now two blickets (0 and 2), light on.\n\n- Remove 2: now one blicket (0), light off.\n\n- Add 2 back: two blickets, light on.\n\n- Remove 0: only 2 (one blicket), light off.\n\nThen later, when they put 0 on machine (with 4?), the light turns on. Wait, in the step where they put 0 and 4 on the machine, the machine light is on. But if the rule is that two blickets are needed, then 0 and 4 would both have to be blickets. But then, when 4 is removed (machine has only 0), the light would turn off. However, according to the steps, after putting 0 and 4 on, the light is on. Then taking 4 off, leaving 0 alone, the light stays on. That contradicts the previous behavior where 0 alone didn't turn it on. So that's confusing.\n\nWait, let's check the exact steps again:\n\nAfter putting object 0 on machine: light off.\n\nThen put 1 on: light off.\n\nThen put 2 on: light turns on.\n\nSo with 0,1,2: light on.\n\nTake 2 off: light off (now 0,1).\n\nPut 2 back: light on.\n\nTake 0 off: light off (now 1,2).\n\nTake 1 off: light off (now 2).\n\nPut 3 on: light off.\n\nTake 3 off: light off.\n\nPut 2 on: already on, but light is off. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the user made a typo here. The step says \"put object 2 on machine\" but it was already on, so the light was off. Then they put 4 on, light off. Then put 0 on (machine has 0 and 4), light on. Then take 4 off, machine has 0, light on.\n\nSo when 0 is alone on the machine, the light is on. But previously, when 0 was alone, the light was off. That's a contradiction unless the rule changed, which isn't possible. So perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the machine's state depends on some other condition, like the order in which objects are placed. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on the machine, and there are multiple blickets. For example, objects 0, 2, and 4 are blickets, but that complicates things.\n\nWait, let's consider the last steps. After experimenting with 3 (no effect), they put 4 on, light off. Then put 0 on, light on. So with 0 and 4 on, light is on. Then take 4 off, light remains on. So 0 alone is on, light on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, the light was off. How can this be?\n\nAh, maybe there's a different rule. Perhaps the machine turns on when the sum of the blickets' \"blicktness\" meets a certain threshold. For example, each blicket has a value, and the sum needs to reach a certain number. For instance, if 0 and 2 are blickets with values 1 each, and the threshold is 2. Then 0 + 2 would reach the threshold. But when 0 is alone, sum is 1, so off. When 0 and 4 are on (assuming 4 is a blicket with value 2), then sum is 1 + 2 =3, which is above threshold, so on. But then taking 4 off (sum 1) would turn it off, but in the steps, it remained on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if an odd number of blickets are present. But that also may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. But then, when 2 is added (assuming it's a blicket) to 0 and 1 (non-blickets), the machine turns on. Then taking 2 off turns it off. Putting 2 back on turns it on. Then taking 0 off (machine has 1 and 2), if 2 is a blicket, then one blicket is present, so light stays on. But according to the steps, when 0 was taken off (machine has 1 and 2), the light turned off. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to list all the experiments and their outcomes:\n\n1. Initial state: object 6 on machine. After taking 6 off, all objects on floor except none on machine.\n\n2. Put 0 on: light off.\n\n3. Put 1 on: light off.\n\n4. Put 2 on: light on.\n\n   So machine has 0,1,2: light on. Suggests that adding 2 caused it to turn on. So 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that having 2 on the machine turns it on. But later steps complicate this.\n\n5. Take 2 off: light off. Machine has 0,1.\n\n6. Put 2 back on: light on. Machine has 0,1,2.\n\n7. Take 0 off: light off. Machine has 1,2.\n\n   If 2 is a blicket, why does removing 0 turn the light off? Maybe the rule requires both 0 and 2 to be present. So 0 and 2 are blickets, and both must be on the machine.\n\n8. Take 1 off: light off. Machine has 2.\n\n9. Put 3 on: light off.\n\n10. Take 3 off: light off.\n\n11. Put 2 on: already on, light off. Hmm, maybe a mistake here, but the user tried to put 2 again, but it was already on, so light remains off.\n\n12. Put 4 on: light off.\n\n13. Put 0 on: machine has 0 and 4. Light on.\n\n14. Take 4 off: machine has 0. Light on.\n\nSo now, when 0 is alone, the light is on. But initially, putting 0 alone didn't turn it on. This is contradictory unless there's a different rule. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of blickets on it is even. For example:\n\n- If 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\n   - 0,1,2: 2 blickets (even) \u2192 on.\n\n   - Remove 0: 1 blicket (odd) \u2192 off.\n\n   - Remove 1: 1 blicket (2) \u2192 off.\n\n   - Later, when 0 is put back with 4 (assuming 4 is not a blicket), then 1 blicket (0) \u2192 odd \u2192 off. But in the step, it turned on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the sum of the blickets' IDs is even. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two objects are on it, and at least one is a blicket. But when 0 and 4 are on, light is on. If 0 is a blicket, then two objects (0 and 4), one blicket \u2192 light on. But earlier, when 0,1,2 were on (three objects, two blickets?), light was on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the key inconsistency is that when 0 is on the machine alone the second time (after putting 0 and 4, then removing 4), the light is on, but the first time when 0 was alone, it was off. This suggests that the rule might depend on something else, like the order in which objects are added. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the machine's state is cumulative. Or maybe there's a hidden state, like the machine needs to be \"primed\" by certain objects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 4 is a blicket. Let's see:\n\nWhen they put 0 and 4 on the machine, light turns on. Then taking 4 off leaves 0, and light stays on. So if 4 is a blicket, then putting 0 and 4 (both blickets) would turn it on. Removing 4 (only 0 left, which is also a blicket) keeps it on. But in the earlier steps, when 0 was alone, the light was off. So this would mean that 0 is not a blicket, but 4 is. But then, when 0 and 4 are on, if 4 is a blicket and 0 is not, then the machine would require at least one blicket (4) \u2192 light on. Then removing 4 leaves 0 (not a blicket), so light off. But according to the steps, after removing 4, the light stays on. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both 0 and 4 are blickets. Then:\n\n- When 0 and 4 are on, both are blickets \u2192 light on.\n\n- Removing 4 leaves 0 (a blicket) \u2192 light stays on.\n\nBut earlier, when 0 was alone, the light was off. That suggests inconsistency unless the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket. But then, when 0 is a blicket, it should turn on when alone. Which it didn't initially. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if there's a blicket present, but only after a certain condition is met. For example, once a blicket has been placed on the machine, the light stays on even if removed. But that doesn't fit the steps either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when the sum of the object numbers is even. Let's check:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on: sum is 0+1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 light off. But the light turned on, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. Then:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on, and 2 is a blicket: light on (one blicket).\n\n- If 0 is a blicket, then adding 0 and 4 (both blickets) would sum to two, so light off. But in the step, it's on. So that's conflicting.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let's try to list possible blickets and see which fit.\n\nPossible candidates for blickets based on the steps:\n\n- Object 2: because adding it caused the light to turn on in the first trial.\n\n- Object 0: because when 0 was added later with 4, the light turned on, and remained on when 4 was removed.\n\nBut why did the light turn on when 0 and 4 were added? If 0 is a blicket, then even when alone, the light should be on. But initially, when 0 was alone, it was off. So maybe there's a different rule. Perhaps the machine turns on if a blicket is placed in combination with another object. For example, if a blicket is placed with an even number of non-blickets. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it turns on if there's at least one blicket on the machine, but only if there's an even number of objects. For example:\n\n- Initially, 0,1,2 (three objects, which is odd). But when 2 is added (a blicket), the light turns on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when there's an odd number of blickets on it. So:\n\n- If 2 is a blicket: adding it to 0,1 (non-blickets) makes 1 blicket (odd) \u2192 on.\n\n- Removing 2 leaves 0,1 (0 blickets) \u2192 off.\n\n- Putting 2 back makes 1 blicket \u2192 on.\n\n- Taking 0 off (machine has 1,2): 1 blicket \u2192 on. But according to the steps, the light turned off. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine requires exactly two objects to be on, one of which is a blicket. For example:\n\n- When 0 and 4 are on (assuming 0 is a blicket), then two objects, one blicket \u2192 on.\n\n- Then removing 4 leaves one object (0, a blicket) \u2192 off. But in the steps, the light stayed on. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Let's try to focus on the key experiments:\n\n1. When 0,1,2 are on: light turns on after adding 2. So adding 2 is the trigger. So 2 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. When 2 is on alone (after removing 0 and 1), the light is off. So why? If 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires only one, this shouldn't happen. So maybe the rule is that two blickets are needed. But where's the second?\n\nWait, perhaps 0 is also a blicket. So in the first case, when 0,1,2 are on, both 0 and 2 are blickets. So two blickets \u2192 light on. Then, removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) \u2192 only one blicket \u2192 light off. Then putting 0 back would add the second blicket again.\n\nBut in the later step, when they put 0 and 4 on, light turns on. If 0 is a blicket, but 4 is not, then having one blicket (0) would not meet the two-blicket requirement. Unless 4 is also a blicket. But then, when 4 is removed, leaving 0, the light should turn off. But in the steps, it stayed on. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket, but once activated, it stays on until a blicket is removed. But that doesn't fit the steps.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it turns on when the total number of blickets is even. Or some other condition. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a specific combination of objects is present, regardless of others. For example, objects 0 and 2 together. So when both are on, light on. Otherwise, off. Let's test:\n\n- 0,1,2: 0 and 2 are on \u2192 light on.\n\n- Remove 2: light off.\n\n- Add 2 back: light on.\n\n- Remove 0: light off (only 2 present).\n\n- Put 0 and 4 on: 0 is present, 2 is not \u2192 light off. But according to the steps, the light turned on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in the step where they put 0 and 4 on the machine, the light turned on. If the rule requires 0 and 4 together, then maybe those are the blickets. But earlier steps don't support that. Because adding 0 initially didn't do anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the sum of the blickets' numbers equals a certain value. For example, 0+2=2. But when 0 and 4 are added, 0+4=4, which might be a different condition. But why would that turn the light on?\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to approach it differently. Which objects are definitely blickets?\n\nFrom the first experiment, object 2 seems crucial. When added to 0 and 1, the light turns on. Then removing 2 turns it off. Adding 2 back turns it on. So 2 is definitely a blicket.\n\nThen, later when they put 0 and 4 on the machine, the light turns on. But when 0 was alone initially, the light was off. So why does it turn on now? Perhaps 0 is also a blicket, but the machine requires at least two blickets. So when 0 and 4 are on (assuming 4 is a blicket), then two blickets \u2192 light on. But when 0 is alone, only one \u2192 off. However, in the step after removing 4, 0 is alone and the light stays on. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 is not a blicket, but 0 is. The machine requires at least one blicket. But then, when 0 is alone, light should be on. But initially, it was off. So that's a contradiction unless the rule changed.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on if the total number of blickets on it is odd. If 2 is a blicket:\n\n- 0,1,2: one blicket (2) \u2192 odd \u2192 on.\n\n- Remove 2: zero \u2192 even \u2192 off.\n\n- Add 2 back: one \u2192 on.\n\n- Remove 0: machine has 1 and 2 \u2192 one blicket \u2192 on. But according to the steps, the light turned off. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that all objects on it are blickets. So if any non-blicket is present, it doesn't turn on. So, if 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not, then when 0,1,2 are on, the machine is off because there are non-blickets. But in the steps, adding 2 turned it on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to look at the key step where putting 0 and 4 on the machine turned it on. Then removing 4 left 0 and the light stayed on. That suggests that 0 is a blicket. But why did the light turn on when 0 and 4 were added, but not when 0 was alone initially? Maybe the initial state had other factors. For example, object 6 was on the machine initially, which might have affected things. But object 6 was taken off early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of blickets is equal to the number of non-blickets. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if there's a blicket and another object that is not a blicket. For example, a blicket paired with a non-blicket. So:\n\n- 0,1,2: if 2 is a blicket and 0 and 1 are not, then there's a blicket (2) and two non-blickets \u2192 light on.\n\n- Removing 2 leaves 0 and 1 \u2192 no blickets \u2192 light off.\n\n- Adding 2 back \u2192 blicket and non-blickets \u2192 on.\n\n- Removing 0 \u2192 1 and 2 (blicket and non-blicket) \u2192 light on. But according to the steps, the light turned off. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to make a table:\n\nExperiments and Results:\n\n1. 0 on \u2192 off.\n\n2. 0,1 \u2192 off.\n\n3. 0,1,2 \u2192 on. So adding 2 caused it to turn on. So 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that presence of 2 turns it on.\n\nBut then, when 2 is on with 1 (after removing 0), light should be on. But according to the steps, it was off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine's rule is that it turns on if object 2 and object 0 are both present. So both are blickets. Let's check:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 both 0 and 2 \u2192 on.\n\n- Remove 2 \u2192 0,1 \u2192 off.\n\n- Add 2 back \u2192 on.\n\n- Remove 0 \u2192 1,2 \u2192 off.\n\n- Put 0 and 4 \u2192 0 and 4 (assuming 4 is not a blicket) \u2192 only 0 is present \u2192 off. But in the steps, it turned on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nUnless 4 is also a blicket. If the rule is that any of the blickets (0,2,4) can be present to turn it on, but that contradicts earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if any even-numbered object is on it. But 2 and 4 are even. So:\n\n- 0 on (even? 0 is even) \u2192 but light was off.\n\n- 0,1 \u2192 0 is even \u2192 light should be on. But it was off.\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 0 and 2 even \u2192 on.\n\n- Take 2 off \u2192 0 even \u2192 light off (contradicts).\n\nSo this doesn't work.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to answer the question: is object 4 a blicket?\n\nFrom the step where they put 0 and 4 on the machine, the light turned on. Then removing 4 left 0 on, and the light stayed on. If 0 is a blicket, then having it alone should turn the light on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it didn't. So this is conflicting. But maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if the total number of objects on it is even. Let's check:\n\n- 0 (1 object) \u2192 odd \u2192 off.\n\n- 0,1 (2) \u2192 even \u2192 off. But according to steps, adding 1 didn't change the light.\n\n- 0,1,2 (3) \u2192 odd \u2192 but light turned on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: when they put 0 and 4 on, light on. Then remove 4, light remains on. So the presence of 0 alone now makes the light on. But initially, 0 alone didn't. This suggests that the rule changed, which isn't possible. Therefore, there must be a different explanation.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a blicket is placed on it after another specific action. For example, once a blicket has been placed and removed, the machine becomes active. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when the sum of the objects' numbers is even. Let's see:\n\n- 0,1,2 sum to 3 (odd) \u2192 light on? No, but according to steps, it turned on.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of objects on it is a multiple of 3. But 0,1,2 (3 objects) \u2192 on. 0,4 (2) \u2192 off. But in steps, it turned on. So no.\n\nI think I need to make a decision based on the available data, even if there's inconsistency. The key points are:\n\n- Object 2 seems to be a blicket because adding it caused the light to turn on.\n\n- Later, putting 0 and 4 turned the light on, and removing 4 left 0, with the light on. This suggests that 0 is also a blicket. Because if 0 is a blicket, then having it alone should turn the light on, but initially, when 0 was alone, it didn't. Unless the rule requires a combination of blickets. For example, the machine needs at least two blickets. But then, 0 and 4 would both need to be blickets. Then, removing 4 would leave 0 (only one blicket), so light should turn off. But according to the steps, it stayed on. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if there's at least one blicket, and the number of objects is even. So:\n\n- 0 (1 object, blicket \u2192 odd \u2192 off).\n\n- 0 and 4 (2 objects, if 0 is a blicket \u2192 even \u2192 on).\n\n- Remove 4 \u2192 1 object, blicket \u2192 off. But in the steps, it stayed on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine's rule is that it turns on if there's exactly one blicket and it's on the machine. But this doesn't fit the later steps.\n\nI think I'm forced to conclude that there's inconsistency, but based on the step where 0 and 4 turn the light on and removing 4 leaves 0 with the light on, 0 must be a blicket. However, initially, 0 alone didn't turn it on. The only way to reconcile this is if the rule requires a blicket to be present along with any other object. So the machine turns on if there's a blicket and at least one other object (regardless of whether it's a blicket). Let's test:\n\n- 0 alone: no \u2192 off.\n\n- 0 and 1: 0 is a blicket \u2192 on. But according to steps, adding 1 didn't turn it on. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is placed on it along with another specific object. For example, object 0 and 2 together.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Given the available information, the most consistent conclusion is that object 2 is a blicket, and object 0 might also be a blicket under a rule that requires at least two blickets. But the step where 0 and 4 are on and then removing 4 leaves 0 with the light on suggests that 0 is a blicket and the rule is that any blicket turns it on. But that contradicts the initial step where 0 alone didn't turn it on. Therefore, this suggests that the initial test where 0 alone didn't turn it on must have been due to a different reason, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a new blicket is added. For example, when you add a blicket that wasn't previously on the machine. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the steps:\n\n- When 0 and 4 are on, light on. Removing 4 leaves 0 and light remains on. This implies that 0 is a blicket. Because when 0 is alone, the light is on. But initially, when 0 was alone, it was off. The only way this makes sense is if the rule changed, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be another explanation.\n\nWait, maybe object 4 is a blicket. When 0 and 4 are on, if 4 is a blicket, then the light turns on. Then removing 4 leaves 0, which is not a blicket, so light should turn off. But according to the steps, it stayed on. So that's impossible. Therefore, object 4 cannot be a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the machine's rule is that it turns on when a blicket is added, but stays on until all blickets are removed. So:\n\n- Put 0 on: adds a blicket \u2192 light on. But according to steps, it was off. So no.\n\nThis is very frustrating. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a best guess.\n\nFrom the steps where putting 0 and 4 on the machine turns it on, and removing 4 leaves 0 with the light on, it suggests that 0 is a blicket. But initially, 0 alone didn't turn it on. So the only way this makes sense is if the machine's rule requires that a blicket be present along with at least one other object (blicket or not). So:\n\n- 0 alone: 1 object, blicket \u2192 off.\n\n- 0 and 4: 2 objects, blicket \u2192 on.\n\n- Removing 4: 1 object \u2192 off. But according to steps, it stayed on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present, regardless of other objects. Then:\n\n- 0 is a blicket \u2192 when added alone, light should be on. But it was off.\n\n- When 0 and 4 are on \u2192 light on (because 0 is a blicket).\n\n- Removing 4 \u2192 0 alone \u2192 light stays on.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial step where 0 alone was off. So this is impossible.\n\nGiven all this, the most plausible answer is that object 4 is not a blicket. Because when 4 was added with 0, the light turned on, but when 4 was removed, the light remained on, indicating that 0 is the blicket. But the initial contradiction remains. However, since the light stayed on after removing 4, it's possible that 0 is a blicket and the initial test had an error or there's a rule I'm missing.\n\nBut given the data, the answer is that object 4 is not a blicket. Because when 4 was on the machine with 0, the light turned on, but when 4 was removed, the light stayed on, implying that 0 is the blicket. However, when 0 was initially alone, the light was off. This contradiction suggests that maybe the rule is different, but based on the later steps, 0 must be a blicket. Therefore, object 4 is not a blicket."}

So, from the interactions above, I need to recall what happened when different objects were placed on the machine.\n\nFirst, when objects 0 and 1 were put on the machine, the light stayed off. Then adding object 2 turned it on. Taking 2 off turned it off again. When 2 was added back alone, the light turned on, so maybe object 2 is a blicket. Then, when they took 0 and 1 off, the light was off. Then putting 3 on didn't do anything. Then 4 was added with 2, but the light stayed off. Wait, no\u2014the sequence was: after removing 0 and 1, putting 3 on machine, then taking it off. Then trying to put 2 again but it was already there. Then putting 4 on machine (so machine has 2 and 4?), but the light was off. Then adding object 0 on machine (so machine has 0, 2, 4?), and the light turned on. Then removing 4 left 0 and 2 on machine, and the light stayed on. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when there's at least two blickets? Because when 0 and 1 were on, nothing. Adding 2 made it three, but the light turned on. Then when only 2 was there, it worked. Wait, no\u2014that contradicts. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first time: 0 and 1 on machine (light off). Adding 2 makes light on. Then taking 2 off, light off. Then putting 2 back alone, light on. So that suggests that object 2 alone is a blicket. Then later, after removing 0 and 1, putting 2 on machine again, but maybe it was already there? Wait, after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine had only object 2. Then they put 3 on machine, which didn't help. Then took 3 off. Then tried to put 2 again but it was already there. Then put 4 on machine (so now 2 and 4?), light off. Then put 0 on machine (so 0, 2, 4), light turned on. Then took 4 off, leaving 0 and 2, and the light stayed on. So when 0 and 2 are on, the machine is on. That suggests that either 0 and 2 together activate it, or maybe 0 is also a blicket. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So if 2 is a blicket, and 0 is not, then maybe the rule is that at least one blicket. But that doesn't fit. Because when 2 alone was on, it worked. Then why did putting 0 and 2 and 4 (but taking 4 off) still have it on? Wait, when 0 was added with 2 and 4, the light turned on. Then removing 4 left 0 and 2, which kept it on. So maybe both 0 and 2 are blickets. But earlier, 0 alone with 1 didn't activate. So if 2 is a blicket, and 0 isn't, then how does 0 and 2 activate the machine? Unless the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. Let's see:\n\nFirst scenario: 0 and 1 (non-blickets) on machine, light off. Adding 2 (blicket) makes total of three objects (0,1,2). But the light turned on. If the rule is that the presence of any blicket, then adding 2 would turn it on. But when they took 2 off, leaving 0 and 1, light off. Then putting 2 back alone, light on. That fits if 2 is a blicket and the rule is \"at least one blicket\". But then later, when 0 and 2 were on, the light was on. If 0 isn't a blicket, then 2 alone would activate it. But when 0 was added to 2, maybe it's still active. Wait, but when 0 was on with 1, adding 2 made it active. So 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not. Then, in the later step, putting 0 on machine with 2 (which is a blicket), the light is on. That still fits the rule: any number of blickets (at least one) turns it on. So why did the light turn on when 0 was added with 2? Because 2 was already there. So in that case, the presence of 2 (a blicket) is enough. \n\nBut wait, there's another scenario: when they put 4 on machine (so machine has 2 and 4), light was off. Then adding 0 (so machine has 0,2,4) turned it on. Then removing 4 (leaving 0 and 2) kept it on. So if 0 and 2 are both blickets, then when 2 and 4 are on, maybe 4 is not a blicket, so only 2 is. But adding 0 (which is a blicket) would make two blickets. Then the rule might be that the machine turns on if there are exactly two blickets. Wait, but earlier, when 2 was alone, the machine turned on. So that would contradict. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the sum of blicktness (like a weight) meets a certain threshold. But without knowing the exact values, that's harder. Alternatively, the rule could be that an even number of blickets are present. But in the first test, adding 2 (a blicket) made it odd (1), and light on. Then when adding 0 (assuming 0 is not a blicket) with 2, it's still 1, so light remains on. Then when adding 4 (non-blicket) to 2, it's still 1, so why was the light off? Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all objects on it are blickets. So when 0,1,2 were on the machine, if 0 and 1 are not blickets, but 2 is, then the presence of non-blickets would deactivate it. But that contradicts the first observation where adding 0 and 1 (non-blickets) didn't activate it, but adding 2 (a blicket) along with 0 and 1 (non) made it activate. So that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if exactly one blicket is present. Then, when 2 is alone, it's on. When 0 and 2 are present (assuming 0 is not a blicket), then it's still one blicket (2), so light remains on. But when 2 and 4 are on, if 4 is not a blicket, then still one blicket (2), so light should be on. But in the steps, when they put 4 on the machine (along with 2?), the light was off. Wait, let me check the exact steps again.\n\nThe steps:\n\nAfter removing 0 and 1, the machine has object 2 on it (light on). Then they put object 3 on machine, light off. Then take 3 off. Then try to put 2 again (already there). Then put 4 on machine: \"You put object 4 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\" So machine has 2 and 4. Light is off. Then put 0 on machine: \"You put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So machine has 0,2,4. Light on. Then take 4 off: machine has 0 and 2, light stays on.\n\nIf the rule is that the machine turns on when there's an odd number of blickets, then:\n\nCase 1: 2 is a blicket. When 2 is alone (1 blicket, odd), light on.\n\nCase 2: Machine has 2 and 4. If 4 is not a blicket, then count is 1 (odd), light should be on. But in this case, the light was off. So that's a contradiction. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets. Then:\n\n- Initially, 0 and 1 (non) + 2 (blicket) = 1 blicket \u2192 not enough. But in the first step, when adding 2 to 0 and 1, the light turned on. That would contradict the rule of needing at least two. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's recount the first steps:\n\n1. put 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n2. put 1 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n3. put 2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n\nSo machine has 0,1,2. Light on. Then taking 2 off \u2192 light off. Then put 2 back \u2192 light on (only 2 on machine). So if 2 is a blicket, then the rule could be that the machine needs at least one blicket. So 2 alone is enough. Then when 0 and 1 are on without 2, light is off. But when 0 and 2 are on (after adding 0 again later), the light is on. That fits. Then, when 2 and 4 are on, the light is off. That would mean that 4 is a blicket? Because 2 (blicket) +4 (blicket) would be two, which would satisfy the 'at least one' rule. But in that case, the light should be on. But according to the steps, when 2 and 4 were on, the light was off. So that's a problem. Unless 4 is not a blicket. Wait, but then why did putting 0,2,4 on the machine turn the light on? Because 0,2,4: if only 2 is a blicket, then the presence of 2 would make it on. But in that case, when 2 and 4 were on (before adding 0), the light should have been on. But the step says that after putting 4 on machine (with 2 already there), the light was off. That's a contradiction if the rule is 'at least one blicket'.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when exactly one blicket is present. Then:\n\n- 0 and 1: no blickets \u2192 off.\n\n- Adding 2 (one blicket) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 alone \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 and 4 \u2192 two objects. If 4 is a blicket, then two blickets \u2192 off. If 4 is not, then one blicket \u2192 on. But in the step, adding 4 to 2 turned the light off. So if 4 is a blicket, then 2 and 4 would be two blickets \u2192 off. But when adding 0 (non) to 2 and 4 (if 4 is a blicket), then total blickets is 2 (2 and 4). So light should be off. But in the step, adding 0 made the light turn on. That doesn't fit. So maybe 4 is not a blicket, but when 2 and 4 are on (only 2 is a blicket), the light should be on. But according to the step, it was off. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires that the number of blickets is a multiple of 3. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the sum of the blicket IDs meets a certain condition. But that's arbitrary without more data.\n\nWait, another angle: when object 0 was put on the machine with 2 and 4 (after 4 was added), the light turned on. Then removing 4 left 0 and 2, and the light stayed on. So when 0 and 2 are on, light is on. That suggests that either 0 is a blicket, or the combination of 0 and 2 (even if neither is a blicket alone). But earlier, 0 and 1 didn't activate, and adding 2 made it activate. So if 0 is not a blicket, and 2 is, then putting 0 and 2 on the machine should still activate (since 2 is a blicket). But in the step where 2 and 4 were on, the light was off. So why? Maybe 4 is a blicket, but the rule requires exactly one. Wait, that's not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule. Let's list all the experiments:\n\n1. Start with 6 on machine. Took it off. Then:\n\n2. Put 0 on \u2192 light off.\n\n3. Put 1 on \u2192 light off.\n\n4. Put 2 on \u2192 light on.\n\nSo 0,1,2 \u2192 on.\n\n5. Take 2 off \u2192 light off (only 0,1 left).\n\n6. Put 2 back \u2192 light on (only 2 on machine).\n\n7. Take 0 and 1 off \u2192 machine has 2 \u2192 light on.\n\nWait, no: after step 6, the machine has 2. Then step 7: take 0 off (but 0 was already on the machine? Wait, no. Let me recheck the steps:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- take object 6 off machine.\n\n- put 0 on machine (light off).\n\n- put 1 on machine (light off).\n\n- put 2 on machine (light on).\n\n- take 2 off (light off).\n\n- put 2 on (light on).\n\n- take 0 off (machine now has 1 and 2? Wait, no. Wait, after putting 0,1,2 on machine, then take 2 off (machine has 0 and1 \u2192 light off). Then put 2 on (machine has 0,1,2 \u2192 light on). Then take 0 off \u2192 machine has 1 and 2 \u2192 light on? Because taking 0 off would leave 1 and 2. But according to the log, after taking 0 off, the light turned off. Wait, let me look again:\n\nUser actions:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nYou took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nSo after taking 0 off, the machine has 1 and 2. But the light is off. So putting 2 on with 1 doesn't activate the machine. That suggests that the presence of 1 and 2 together turns it off. But that's confusing. Because earlier, 0,1,2 \u2192 on. Then taking 0 off leaves 1 and 2 \u2192 off. So 1 and 2 together turn it off, but adding 0 made it on again. So maybe the rule is more complex. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present. Then:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 on. If two of them are blickets, but which ones?\n\nBut when 2 is alone, the light is on. So that would require that 2 is a blicket and the rule is at least one. But then in the case of 1 and 2, the light would be on. But according to the step, taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) made the light off. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try to track which combinations turned the light on and off.\n\nExperiments:\n\n1. 0,1 \u2192 off.\n\n2. 0,1,2 \u2192 on.\n\n3. 2 \u2192 on.\n\n4. 1,2 \u2192 off.\n\n5. 0,2 \u2192 on.\n\nWait, when after taking 0 and 1 off, they put 3 on (machine has 3) \u2192 off. Then took 3 off. Then tried to put 2 again (already there?), then put 4 on (machine has 2 and 4) \u2192 off. Then put 0 on (machine has 0,2,4) \u2192 on. Then removed 4 \u2192 0,2 \u2192 on.\n\nSo:\n\n- 0,2,4 \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,2 \u2192 on.\n\n- 2,4 \u2192 off.\n\n- 2 alone \u2192 on.\n\nSo, when 2 is alone \u2192 on. When 2 and 4 \u2192 off. But when 0 is added (0,2,4) \u2192 on. Then removing 4 (0,2) \u2192 on.\n\nThis suggests that 0 and 2 together are required. But then why does 2 alone work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0 and 2 are both blickets, but 4 is a suppressor. Wait, but the problem states that only blickets affect the machine. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if the total number of blickets is odd. Let's see:\n\nAssuming 2 and 0 are blickets:\n\n- 2 alone (1 \u2192 odd) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 and 4 \u2192 if 4 is not a blicket, then 1 \u2192 on. But in the step, it was off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, 2 is a blicket, 0 is not, 4 is not.\n\nThen:\n\n- 2 alone \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 and 4 \u2192 on (since 1 blicket), but in the step, it's off. So contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if there's a blicket with an even number. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when the sum of the object numbers is even or something. Let's check:\n\n- 0+1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 light on. Doesn't fit.\n\n- 2 \u2192 2 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0+2+4=6 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2+4=6 (even) \u2192 light off (contradiction).\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket and the total number of objects is odd.\n\nLet's test:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 3 objects (odd), at least one blicket (2) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 \u2192 1 object (odd) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2,4 \u2192 2 objects (even), but has blicket \u2192 light off.\n\n- 0,2,4 \u2192 3 objects (odd) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,2 \u2192 2 objects (even) \u2192 light on? But in the step, after removing 4, 0 and 2 (2 objects) \u2192 light stays on. So contradiction.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to list possible blicket candidates.\n\nFrom the steps:\n\n- Object 2 seems to be a blicket because when it's alone, the machine is on.\n\n- Object 0: when added to 2 and 4 (which were off), turning on suggests that adding 0 made the combination valid. But when 0 and 2 are on, it's on. But earlier, 0 and 1 (non) didn't activate. So if 0 is a blicket, then when 0 and 1 are on, it would activate if the rule is any blicket. But in that case, the light was off. So 0 is not a blicket.\n\nBut then, when 0,2,4 are on, the light turns on. If 2 is a blicket, then adding 0 and 4 (non-blickets) shouldn't affect. Unless the rule is that the number of blickets is odd. 2 (1) is odd \u2192 on. 2 and 4 (if 4 is a blicket, then 2 blickets \u2192 even \u2192 off. If 4 is not, then 1 \u2192 on. But in the step, putting 4 on with 2 turned it off. So maybe 4 is a blicket. Then 2 and 4 \u2192 2 blickets \u2192 even \u2192 off. Then adding 0 (non) makes the total blickets 2 \u2192 even \u2192 off. But in the step, adding 0 made it on. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if all objects on it are blickets. So:\n\n- 0,1,2: if 2 is a blicket but 0 and 1 are not, then the presence of non-blickets would make it off. But in the step, adding 2 turned it on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present. Then:\n\n- 0,1,2: if two are blickets, but which ones? Maybe 2 and 0. But then when 0 and 1 are on, if 0 is a blicket, but 1 is not, then it's one blicket \u2192 off. Adding 2 (another blicket) makes two \u2192 on. Then taking 2 off leaves one \u2192 off. Putting 2 back \u2192 two blickets (0 and 2) \u2192 on. But earlier, when 0 and 2 were on the machine (after removing 1), the light was on. But in the step where they took 0 and 1 off (leaving 2), the light was on. So that would require that 2 alone is a blicket, which would contradict the 'exactly two' rule.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to look for patterns.\n\nKey observations:\n\n- Putting 2 alone activates the machine. So 2 must be a blicket, and the rule requires at least one.\n\n- When 2 and 4 are on, the machine is off. So that suggests that 4 might be a blicket, making the total two, which could imply a different rule (like even number). But adding 0 to 2 and 4 turns it on. If 0 is not a blicket, then 2 and 4 would be two blickets (even) \u2192 machine off. Adding 0 (non) doesn't change the count, but the machine turns on. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 is a suppressor. But the problem states that only blickets affect the machine.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket and the total number of objects is odd. Let's test:\n\n- 2 alone (1 object, odd) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 and 4 (2 objects, even) \u2192 off.\n\n- 0,2,4 (3 objects, odd) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 and 2 (2 objects, even) \u2192 off. But according to the steps, after removing 4, the light stayed on. So contradiction.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think about the minimal case:\n\n- Object 2 alone \u2192 on. So 2 is a blicket.\n\n- When 2 and 4 are on \u2192 off. So adding 4 (a non-blicket) doesn't change the fact that there's a blicket (2). Unless the rule requires exactly one object. But that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if the number of blickets is greater than the number of non-blickets. But in the case of 2 alone: 1 blicket, 0 non \u2192 1>0 \u2192 on. When 2 and 4 (assuming 4 is non): 1>1 \u2192 no. So light off. When adding 0 (non), making 2,4,0 (all non except 2): 1>2 \u2192 no. But in the step, light turns on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's a blicket and the total number of objects is a prime number. Let's see:\n\n- 2 alone (1 object, not prime) \u2192 off. But in the step, it was on. So no.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to list possible blickets based on when the light turned on.\n\nWhen the light turned on:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2 on \u2192 on.\n\n- After putting 2 on \u2192 on.\n\n- After putting 0,2,4 on \u2192 on.\n\n- After removing 4 (0 and 2) \u2192 on.\n\nWhen the light turned off:\n\n- After removing 2 from 0,1,2 \u2192 off.\n\n- After putting 3 on \u2192 off.\n\n- Putting 4 on (2 and 4) \u2192 off.\n\nSo, possible blickets:\n\n- Object 2: present in all on cases.\n\n- Object 0: present in some on cases (0,2,4 and 0,2) but not others (0,1).\n\n- Object 4: present in 0,2,4 but not in others. But when 4 was with 2, light was off.\n\nThis suggests that 2 is a blicket, and maybe 0 is also a blicket. Because when 0 and 2 are on, the light is on. But when 0 is with 1, it's off. So 0 might be a blicket only when paired with 2. But that's not possible; blicketness is an inherent property.\n\nAlternatively, the rule requires that either 2 is present, or 0 and some other object. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present and the total number of objects is even. Wait:\n\n- 0,1,2: 3 objects (odd) \u2192 but light on. So no.\n\n- 2 alone: 1 (odd) \u2192 on. No.\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's exactly one blicket, and it's object 2. So any other objects added would deactivate it. But when 0,1,2 are on, adding 2 (a blicket) and non-blickets 0 and 1, but the light is on. That would mean that the presence of non-blickets doesn't affect, which contradicts the step where 2 and 4 (assuming 4 is non) are on and light is off.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to use elimination.\n\nWe need to determine if object 5 is a blicket. But in all the steps, object 5 was never placed on the machine. So we have no direct evidence about 5. But maybe from the rule, we can infer. If the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, then 5 could be a blicket or not, but since it wasn't tested, we can't know. But perhaps the rule requires more, and the blickets are 2 and 0.\n\nWait, in the step where 0,2,4 were on and the light was on, then removing 4 left 0 and 2, light on. So if 0 is a blicket, then 0 and 2 would activate the machine. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on, light was off. So if 0 is a blicket, then 0 and 1 (assuming 1 is non) should activate the machine (since at least one blicket). But it didn't. So that suggests 0 is not a blicket. Therefore, the light must have turned on in the 0,2,4 case because 2 is a blicket and perhaps the number of objects is odd. But earlier, when 2 and 4 (even number) were on, light was off. Then adding 0 (making it 3) turned it on. But 3 is odd, and with 2 (blicket), maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is present and the number of objects is odd. So:\n\n- 0,1,2 (3 objects) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 (1) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,2,4 (3) \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 and 4 (2) \u2192 off.\n\n- 0 and 2 (2) \u2192 off. But according to the step, after removing 4, the light stayed on. Wait, no: when they added 0 to 2 and 4 (making 3 objects \u2192 on), then removed 4 (leaving 0 and 2 \u2192 2 objects), the light stayed on. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to think simpler.\n\nThe key experiments:\n\n- Putting 2 alone \u2192 light on. So 2 is a blicket.\n\n- Putting 2 and 4 \u2192 light off. This suggests that adding 4 somehow negates the effect. But according to the problem statement, only blickets affect the machine. So 4 must be a blicket. But if both 2 and 4 are blickets, then according to the rule \"at least one blicket\", the light should be on. But it's off. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if an odd number of blickets are present. If 2 and 4 are both blickets, then 2 \u2192 on (1, odd). 2 and 4 \u2192 2 (even) \u2192 off. Then adding 0 (non) \u2192 2 and 4 \u2192 off. But in the step, adding 0 to 2 and 4 turned it on. So that would require that 0 is a blicket, making the total 3 (odd). But then when 0 and 2 are on (2 blickets), it would be even \u2192 off. But in the step, it was on. Contradiction.\n\nThis is too confusing. Let's try to answer based on the available info. Object 5 was never tested. But the question is whether it's a blicket. Since there's no evidence of it being on the machine, and the rule may require certain combinations, perhaps object 5 is not a blicket. But the rule could be something like \"blickets are even-numbered objects\", which would make 2 and 4 blickets. But in the step where 2 and 4 were on, the light was off. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when a single blicket is present, and object 2 is the only blicket. Then object 5 is not a blicket. But the step where 0,2,4 are on and the light is on would be explained by the presence of 2. But when 2 and 4 are on, the light is off, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when object 2 is present along with any other object. So 2 alone \u2192 on. 2 with others \u2192 on. But when 2 and 4 were on, the light was off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the rule is that the machine turns on when object 2 and an even-numbered object (other than 2) are present. But that's arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the steps, I think the most plausible answer is that object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. However, the step where 2 and 4 were on and the light was off contradicts that. Unless 4 is a blicket, making the count two, and the rule requires an odd number. But then adding 0 (non) would make it three objects, but only two blickets \u2192 even \u2192 off. But in the step, it turned on. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 is a blicket, and the rule requires exactly one blicket. Then:\n\n- 2 alone \u2192 on.\n\n- 4 alone \u2192 on.\n\n- 2 and 4 \u2192 off.\n\n- 0,2,4 \u2192 off (if 0 is non, but adding 0 to 2 and 4 makes three objects, but still two blickets \u2192 off. But in the step, it turned on. So contradiction.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the best conclusion is that object 5 is not a blicket. Since there's no interaction with object 5, and the other blickets are 2 and possibly 0. But without more info, it's safer to say object 5 is not a blicket."}

So, the machine turns on based on certain rules involving the objects placed on it. From the actions taken during the game, I need to analyze which objects caused the machine to light up.\n\nFirst, the initial state was that object 6 was on the machine, but the light was off. Then, when they took object 6 off, the light remained off. So, having just object 6 on the machine initially didn't activate it. That might suggest object 6 isn't a blicket, but maybe there's a combination needed.\n\nNext, when they put objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine one by one, the light turned on after adding object 2. Then, removing 2 turned the light off, and putting it back on turned it on again. So object 2 seems to be a blicket. Then, when they removed objects 0 and 1, leaving only 2, the light stayed off when they took 2 off. Wait, no\u2014when they put 2 back on, the light came on again. Wait, after putting 0 and 1 and 2, the machine turned on. But when they removed 0 and 1, leaving only 2, the machine was off. Then putting 2 on again turned it on. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, after putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light went on. Then they took 2 off, which turned the light off. Then putting 2 back on made the light turn on again. That suggests that object 2 alone can activate the machine. But later, when they took 0 and 1 off, leaving only 2 on, the light was on. Wait, no. Let me look at the exact steps:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2 on, light is on.\n- Take 2 off: light off.\n- Put 2 back on: light on. So 2 alone makes it on.\nThen they take 0 and 1 off. So machine has only 2. Taking 0 off (machine still has 1 and 2?), wait no:\n\nWait, initial steps: the user did:\n\nput 0 on machine (light off)\nput 1 on machine (still off)\nput 2 on machine (light on). So three objects on machine: 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nThen take 2 off: light off. So remaining 0 and 1 on machine. Then put 2 back on: light on again. So 0,1,2 \u2192 on. Then take 0 and 1 off: machine has only 2. After that, when they take 0 off (which was on the machine), then 1 off, so machine is empty? Then they put 3 on (no effect), then 4 on (no effect), then 0 on (with 4 and 0? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me retrace each step:\n\n1. Start: object 6 is on machine, others on floor. Light off.\n2. Take 6 off: machine empty, light off.\n3. Put 0 on machine. Now machine has 0. Light off.\n4. Put 1 on machine. Now 0 and 1. Light still off.\n5. Put 2 on machine. Now 0,1,2. Light turns on.\n6. Take 2 off. Now 0 and 1. Light off.\n7. Put 2 back. Now 0,1,2. Light on.\n8. Take 0 off. Now 1 and 2. Light still on? Or off? Wait, the step says after taking 0 off, light is off. Wait, the user's log says:\n\nAfter taking 0 off, the light is off. Then taking 1 off (so machine is empty?), and putting 3 on (no effect), etc.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check the exact logs again:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on, the light is on. Then take 2 off \u2192 light off. Then put 2 back \u2192 light on. Then take 0 off \u2192 light off. So machine now has 1 and 2? Or maybe when they took 0 off, machine has 1 and 2, but light turned off. Then take 1 off \u2192 machine has only 2? But light was off after taking 0 off, which would mean that 1 and 2 together are not sufficient. But when 2 was on alone (after putting 2 back), the light was on. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the exact steps:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\n- put 0 on \u2192 light off (machine: 0)\n- put 1 on \u2192 light off (0,1)\n- put 2 on \u2192 light on (0,1,2)\n- take 2 off \u2192 light off (0,1)\n- put 2 on \u2192 light on (0,1,2)\n- take 0 off \u2192 light off (1,2)\n- take 1 off \u2192 light off (empty)\n- put 3 on \u2192 light off (3)\n- take 3 off \u2192 light off (empty)\n- put 2 on \u2192 light on (2)\n- put 4 on \u2192 light off (2,4)\n- put 0 on \u2192 light on (0,2,4)\n- take 4 off \u2192 light on (0,2)\n\nWait, no. Let me parse each action and the outcome:\n\nAfter the initial steps:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2 on, light is on. So 0,1,2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n- Take 2 off \u2192 light off. So 0 and 1 on \u2192 light off. Then put 2 back \u2192 light on. So 0,1,2 again \u2192 on.\n- Then take 0 off \u2192 light off. So 1 and 2 on \u2192 light off. So 1 and 2 together don't activate.\n- Then take 1 off \u2192 machine empty. Light off.\n- Then put 3 on \u2192 light remains off. So 3 alone doesn't activate.\n- Then take 3 off \u2192 still off.\n- Put 2 on \u2192 light on. So 2 alone activates.\n- Then put 4 on \u2192 light off. Wait, putting 4 on machine (now 2 and 4 are on) \u2192 light turns off. So 2 and 4 together don't activate. But 2 alone did. Then putting 0 on (so 2,4,0) \u2192 light on. Then taking 4 off leaves 2 and 0 \u2192 light remains on.\n\nSo this suggests that when 0 and 2 are on together, the machine activates. But earlier, when 0,1,2 were on, and then 0 was removed (leaving 1,2), the light went off. Then when 2 was alone, the light was on. But then adding 4 to 2 turned it off, and adding 0 to 2 and 4 turned it on again. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let's try to see possible rules.\n\nPossible rules could be that the machine activates when the total number of blickets on it is even, or odd, or a specific combination. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that certain individual objects are blickets and their presence (regardless of others) activate the machine, or that the sum of their \"blicktness\" meets a threshold.\n\nWait, when 2 was alone on the machine, the light turned on. So 2 is definitely a blicket. Then, putting 4 on (with 2) turned it off. So adding 4 (a non-blicket?) to 2 (blicket) caused the light to turn off. Then adding 0 (blicket?) to 2 and 4 made it turn on again. Then removing 4 (leaving 0 and 2) kept it on. So maybe 0 is also a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But that can't be because when 2 and 4 were on, the light was off. Wait, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present. If 2 and 0 are blickets, then:\n\n- 2 alone (1 blicket, odd) \u2192 on.\n- 2 and 4 (1 blicket, odd) \u2192 on. But when 4 was added to 2, the light turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. So when 0 and 2 are on, it's two \u2192 on. But earlier, 0,1,2 were on and activated. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then that's two \u2192 on, but 0,1,2 would be two blickets, same as 0 and 2. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the steps again:\n\n- put 0 on (no effect)\n- put 1 on (no effect)\n- put 2 on \u2192 light on. So 0,1,2 on, light on. So if 0 and 2 are blickets, then two blickets \u2192 light on. Then taking 2 off leaves 0 and 1 \u2192 light off. Then putting 2 back \u2192 0,1,2 \u2192 light on (two blickets again). Then taking 0 off leaves 1 and 2 \u2192 if 2 is a blicket, that's one \u2192 light off. Then take 1 off, put 2 on \u2192 light on (2 alone). Then put 4 on \u2192 light off. So 2 and 4 \u2192 light off. Then put 0 on \u2192 0,2,4 \u2192 light on. If 0 and 2 are blickets, two blickets \u2192 on. Then remove 4 \u2192 0 and 2 \u2192 light stays on. That fits if the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed, and 0 and 2 are the blickets.\n\nSo, when 0 and 2 are both on the machine, the light is on. When only one (like 2 alone) is on, it's off. But wait, in the steps:\n\nAfter putting 2 back on (after taking 0 and 1 off), the machine has only 2. The light turns on. So according to that, 2 alone activates the machine. That contradicts the earlier hypothesis of needing exactly two. So maybe the rule is different. Let me recheck:\n\n- After taking 0 off (machine has 1 and 2), light is off. Then take 1 off (machine empty). Then put 2 on \u2192 light on. So 2 alone \u2192 on. Then put 4 on \u2192 light off. So 2 and 4 \u2192 off. Then put 0 on \u2192 0,2,4 \u2192 on. Then take 4 off \u2192 0 and 2 \u2192 on. So 0 and 2 together \u2192 on. 2 alone \u2192 on. But when 2 and 4 are on \u2192 off. Hmm. This is inconsistent if the rule is based on the presence of certain blickets. Unless there's a different rule, like the machine activates when the sum of blicktness is even, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 0 and 2 are blickets, and the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But then, when 2 is alone \u2192 on. When 2 and 4 (non-blicket) \u2192 on. But in the log, after putting 4 on the machine with 2, the light turned off. So that contradicts. Therefore, maybe the rule is that the machine activates only if exactly one blicket is present. So:\n\n- 2 is a blicket. 2 alone \u2192 on (1 blicket).\n- Adding 4 (non) \u2192 2 and 4. Now one blicket \u2192 should stay on. But the light turned off. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if the number of blickets is even. So:\n\n- 0 and 2 are blickets. When both are on \u2192 even (2) \u2192 on. When only 2 \u2192 odd (1) \u2192 off. But earlier, when 2 was alone, the light was on. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if the total weight (sum) of blicktness is a multiple of some number, but that's getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: track which combinations activated the machine.\n\nFirst activation:\n\n0,1,2 \u2192 on. Possible blickets could be 2 (if others are not), but then when 0 and 1 are added and 2 is not, it's off. Then adding 2 makes it on. So maybe 2 is the only blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. Then why when 2 is on alone, it's on. But when 2 and 4 are on, the light turns off. That would mean that 4 is a blicket and the rule is even number of blickets. But that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's list all the steps where the machine turned on and what objects were present:\n\n1. After adding 2 to 0 and 1 \u2192 on. So objects 0,1,2 on. Light on.\n2. After removing 2 and putting back \u2192 0,1,2 \u2192 on again.\n3. After taking 0 and 1 off, putting 2 on \u2192 light on (only 2).\n4. Adding 4 to 2 \u2192 light off (2 and 4).\n5. Adding 0 to 2 and 4 \u2192 light on (0,2,4).\n6. Removing 4 from 0,2,4 \u2192 0 and 2 \u2192 light remains on.\n\nSo, the machine is on in the following cases:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 on.\n- 0,2,4 \u2192 on.\n- 0,2 \u2192 on.\n- 2 \u2192 on.\n\nBut it's off when:\n\n- 2 and 4 \u2192 off.\n- 0 and 1 \u2192 off.\n- 3 \u2192 off.\n- 4 \u2192 off.\n- 0 \u2192 off.\n- 1 \u2192 off.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of object 2 and/or object 0 activates the machine. Wait, when 0 and 2 are together, the machine is on. But when 2 is alone, it's on. When 0 is with 2 and 4, it's on. When 0 is added to 2 and 4, it turns on. So perhaps object 0 and 2 are blickets, and the machine activates if at least one of them is present. But when 2 is on with 4, it's off. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when exactly one of 0 or 2 is present. But when both are present (like 0,2), it's on. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 2 is a blicket and object 0 is an inhibitor. Wait, when 2 is alone \u2192 on. When 2 is with 0 \u2192 on. But when 2 is with 4 \u2192 off. Unless 4 is an inhibitor. But adding 0 to 2 and 4 makes it on again. So 0 and 2 are blickets, 4 is an inhibitor. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if the sum of the object numbers is even or odd. Let's see:\n\nWhen objects 0,1,2 are on: sum 0+1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 light on. Then when 2 is removed: 0+1=1 (odd) \u2192 light off. Hmm, not matching. When 2 is added again: sum 3 \u2192 on. When 0 is removed: sum 1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 light off. Then 1 removed, sum 2 \u2192 even. If the rule is sum even \u2192 on, then sum 2 (even) \u2192 on, but when they put 2 alone, the sum is 2 \u2192 even, and the light was on. But when 2 and 4 are on, sum 6 \u2192 even, but light was off. So that's contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is based on the number of objects. Let's check:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 3 objects \u2192 light on.\n- 2 \u2192 1 object \u2192 light on.\n- 0,2,4 \u2192 3 objects \u2192 light on.\n- 2,4 \u2192 2 objects \u2192 light off.\nSo maybe the machine activates when there's an odd number of objects. But when 2 is alone (1 object, odd) \u2192 on. 2 and 4 (2 \u2192 even) \u2192 off. 0,2,4 \u2192 3 \u2192 on. That fits. But initial step: 0,1,2 (3 \u2192 on), then removing 2 leaves 2 objects (even) \u2192 off. Adding 2 back makes 3 \u2192 on. Removing 0 and 1 leaves 1 (2) \u2192 1 object \u2192 on. But according to the log, after taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2 \u2192 2 objects), the light was off. Then taking 1 off (0 objects) \u2192 off. Then putting 2 on (1 object) \u2192 on. So this fits the rule of machine on when odd number of objects. But then why when adding 4 to 2 (total 2 \u2192 even), light off. Adding 0 to 2 and 4 (3 \u2192 on). Taking 4 off (2 objects \u2192 0 and 2 \u2192 even), but the light stays on. Wait, according to the log, after taking 4 off when the machine had 0,2,4 \u2192 removing 4 leaves 0 and 2 \u2192 2 objects \u2192 even, but light was on. This contradicts the previous pattern. So that's not the rule.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern where the machine activates when specific objects are present. The key moments when the machine turned on were when 2 was added, either alone or with others. Let's look:\n\n- When 2 is added to 0 and 1 \u2192 on.\n- When 2 is added again after being removed \u2192 on.\n- When 2 is put alone \u2192 on.\n- When 0 is added to 2 and 4 \u2192 on.\n- When 4 is removed from 0,2,4 \u2192 0 and 2 remain \u2192 on.\n\nSo in all cases where 2 is present, except when 4 is also present, the machine is on. When 4 is added to 2, the light goes off. Adding 0 to 2 and 4 turns it back on. Removing 4 from 0,2,4 leaves 0 and 2 \u2192 on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, 4 is an inhibitor, and 0 counteracts the inhibitor? Or perhaps 0 is also a blicket. But then, when 0 and 2 are present, regardless of others, the machine is on.\n\nWait, when 2 is alone \u2192 on. 2 and 4 \u2192 off. 0,2,4 \u2192 on. 0 and 2 \u2192 on. So maybe the presence of 0 cancels out the inhibitor effect of 4. But this is getting too complex. Let's think differently.\n\nThe first time the machine turned on was when 0,1,2 were all on. Then removing 2 turned it off. Adding 2 back turned it on. So 2 is critical. Then, when 0 and 1 were removed, leaving 2 alone \u2192 on. Then adding 4 to 2 turned it off. Adding 0 to 2 and 4 turned it on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if there's an odd number of blickets, and 2 is a blicket. But when 2 is alone \u2192 1 (odd) \u2192 on. 2 and 4 (assuming 4 is not a blicket) \u2192 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 on. But in the log, adding 4 to 2 turned it off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on if the number of blickets is at least two. But 2 alone would not, but according to the log, 2 alone does turn it on. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe object 0 and 2 are blickets. Then:\n\n- 0,1,2 \u2192 two blickets \u2192 on.\n- 0 and 1 \u2192 one blicket \u2192 off.\n- 2 alone \u2192 one \u2192 off. But according to the log, 2 alone turned it on. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 2 is a blicket and object 0 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one to be present. But then, when 2 is alone \u2192 on. 0 and 2 \u2192 on. 0,2,4 \u2192 on. 2 and 4 \u2192 on (since 2 is present). But in the log, when 4 was added to 2, the light turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's consider another angle. The initial setup had object 6 on the machine, but the light was off. So even with 6 on the machine, light is off. Therefore, object 6 is not a blicket. Because if it were, the machine would have been on initially. But the user took 6 off and then the machine remained off. So regardless of other combinations, object 6 doesn't activate the machine when placed alone. Hence, object 6 is not a blicket."}

So object 2 seems to be a blicket because its presence on the machine causes the light to activate. \n\nLater, they tried objects 3 and 4, but adding them alone didn't turn the light on. Then, they put object 0 back on the machine along with 2, and the light turned on. But when they removed object 4, the light stayed on. Wait, let me check again. After putting 0 and 4 on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 4, the light remained on. Hmm, that suggests that maybe object 0 is a blicket. But when they first added 0 and 1, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not. But later, putting 0 and 2 together turned it on again. Wait, when they put 0 on the machine again (after having 2 already on), the light turned on. Wait, no. Let me retrace:\n\nAfter taking objects 0,1 off, the machine had only 2 on, which was on and the light was on. Then they took 2 off, light off. Then put 3 on, light off. Then put 2 back, light on. Then took 0 and 1 off. Then put 3 on, which didn't help. Then tried 4, didn't help. Then put 0 back on machine (with 2 and 4?), no, wait. Let me look step by step.\n\nThe steps after taking 0 and 1 off:\n\n- Put object 3 on machine: light off.\n\n- Took 3 off.\n\n- Tried putting 2 again (already on machine, so no action). \n\n- Then put object 4 on machine (light off). \n\n- Then put object 0 on machine. At this point, machine has 0, 4, and 2? Wait, because 2 was already on the machine when they tried to add it again. Wait, after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine had object 2 on it. Then they added 3 (machine: 2 and 3), light off. Then took 3 off (only 2 remains, light on?). Wait, no. Let me check the exact steps:\n\nOriginal steps after taking 0 and 1 off:\n\n1. put object 3 on machine: light off. So machine has 2 and 3. Light off.\n\n2. take 3 off: machine back to just 2. Light on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when they put 3 on the machine (machine had 2 and 3?), but the light was off. Then removing 3 would leave 2 on the machine. But after taking 3 off, the light is off. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check the exact logs:\n\nAfter taking 0 and 1 off:\n\n- put object 3 on machine: machine has 3. Because previously, after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine had 2 on it. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the sequence:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nAfter initial setup, objects 6 was on machine, but taken off. Then:\n\n- put 0, 1, 2 on machine. Light on after adding 2. Then take 2 off (light off). Put 2 back (light on). Then take 0 and 1 off (machine now has only 2, light should be on? Because adding 2 alone made light on before. Wait, when they took 2 off, light went off. Then putting 2 back made light on. Then they took 0 and 1 off. So machine has 2. Then:\n\n- put 3 on machine: machine now has 2 and 3. Light off. Then take 3 off (machine back to 2. Light on again?). But according to the log, after putting 3 on machine, the light is off. Then taking 3 off, the light is off. Wait, that's conflicting. Because if machine had 2 alone, the light was on. Adding 3 made it off. Then removing 3 would leave 2, so light should turn on again. But according to the log, after taking 3 off, the light is off. That suggests that the presence of 2 alone is not sufficient. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, let me check the exact log entries:\n\nUser actions and results:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\nYou took object 1 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nSo after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine has only object 2 on it. But the light is off. Wait, but earlier when they put object 2 on the machine (after taking 0 and 1 off?), the light turned on. Wait, the log shows:\n\nAfter taking 0 and 1 off:\n\n- They put 3 on machine: light off.\n\nWait, no. Let me retrace all steps again:\n\n1. Start: objects 0-5 on floor, 6 on machine. Light off.\n\n2. Take 6 off. Now all objects on floor. Light off.\n\n3. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n\n4. Put 1 on machine: light off.\n\n5. Put 2 on machine: light turns on. So now machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\n6. Take 2 off: light off. Now machine has 0 and 1.\n\n7. Put 2 back on machine: light on. Now machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n\n8. Take 0 off: light remains on? Because when they took 0 off, machine has 1 and 2. Did the light stay on? Wait, after taking 0 off, the log says \"light is currently off\". Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nStep 8: take object 0 off machine. Result: light off. So machine now has 1 and 2. Light off.\n\nThen step 9: take object 1 off. Now machine has nothing. Light off.\n\nSo after that, machine is empty. Then:\n\n10. Put 3 on machine: light off.\n\n11. Take 3 off: light off.\n\n12. Try to put 2 on machine again. It's already on machine? Wait, no. At step 9, machine was emptied. Then step 10: put 3 on, then step 11: take 3 off. So machine is empty again. Then step 12: put 2 on machine. So machine has 2. Light turns on. Because earlier, when 2 was added, it turned on. But wait, in the log, when they put 2 on machine again (step 12?), the log says \"You put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" But according to the user's steps as written:\n\nWait, the user's steps after taking 0 and 1 off:\n\n- put object 3 on machine: light off.\n\n- take object 3 off: light off.\n\n- put object 2 on machine: but the log says \"object 2 is already on the machine. The light is off.\" Wait, no. Let me recheck the exact log provided:\n\nThe user's steps after taking 0 and 1 off:\n\n> put object 3 on machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n> take object 3 off machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n> put object 2 on machine\nobject 2 is already on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine had object 2 on it. Then they took 0 and 1 off, leaving 2 on the machine. Then they put 3 on, making the machine have 2 and 3. Light off. Then they took 3 off, leaving 2. So the machine still has 2 on it. So when they tried to put 2 on again, it's already there. Then they put 4 on machine (machine now has 2 and 4). Light off. Then put 0 on machine (machine has 0,2,4). Light on. Then took 4 off (machine has 0 and 2). Light remains on.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me summarize the key points:\n\n- Adding 0,1,2 makes light on. But when 2 is removed, light goes off.\n\n- Adding 2 back alone doesn't turn it on. Wait, no. After step 7: after taking 0 and 1 off, machine has 2. Then the light is off. Wait, but earlier when they put 2 on with 0 and 1, light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 left 2 on the machine, but light turned off. That suggests that 2 alone isn't sufficient. So maybe the rule is that multiple blickets are needed. For example, at least two blickets.\n\nWait, when they added 0,1,2: light on. Removing 2: light off. Then adding 2 back (with 0 and 1 still on?), no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. Put 0,1,2 on machine. Light on.\n\n2. Take 2 off. Light off (machine has 0 and 1).\n\n3. Put 2 back on. Light on again (machine has 0,1,2).\n\n4. Take 0 off. Light off (machine has 1,2).\n\n5. Take 1 off. Light off (machine empty).\n\nSo when machine has 1 and 2, light is off. So 1 and 2 together don't activate it. But when 0,1,2 are there, it does. Hmm. Then later:\n\nAfter step 5, machine is empty. Then:\n\n6. Put 3 on: light off.\n\n7. Take 3 off: light off.\n\n8. Put 2 on: light on? Because in step 3, putting 2 on when machine had 0 and 1 made it light on. But in step 8, putting 2 on an empty machine: does it turn on? Wait, according to the log, when they tried to put 2 on again (after removing 3), the log says \"object 2 is already on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\" Wait, that must be a mistake. Let me check the exact log again:\n\nThe user's commands after taking 1 off (machine empty):\n\n> put object 3 on machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n> take object 3 off machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n> put object 2 on machine\nobject 2 is already on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If the machine was empty after taking 3 off, then putting 2 on should add it. But the log says \"object 2 is already on the machine.\" Which suggests that the user tried to put 2 on when it was already there. So maybe there's a mistake in the log. Alternatively, perhaps after taking 0 and 1 off, object 2 was still on the machine. Let me check the exact steps again.\n\nOriginal steps after step 9 (taking 1 off):\n\nAfter step 9: machine has object 2 (because after step 7: put object 2 on machine (machine had 0,1,2, light on). Then step 8: take 0 off (machine has 1,2, light off). Step 9: take 1 off (machine has 2, light off). So at this point, machine has 2. Then:\n\n> put object 3 on machine: machine now has 2 and 3. Light off.\n\n> take object 3 off: machine back to 2. Light off.\n\nThen they try to put 2 on machine again, but it's already there. So the machine has 2, but light is off. So 2 alone doesn't activate the machine. Then they put 4 on machine (machine has 2 and 4, light off). Then put 0 on machine (now 0,2,4. Light on). Then take 4 off (machine has 0 and 2. Light remains on).\n\nSo when 0 and 2 are on the machine, light is on. But when 2 alone is on, light is off. So this suggests that both 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. Because 0 and 2 together make it on, but 0 alone didn't (when 0 was put on machine alone, light was off). Similarly, 2 alone doesn't. But 0 and 2 together do. Let's confirm:\n\nWhen they first put 0,1,2 on machine, light on. Then take 2 off (0 and 1 left, light off). So 0 and 1 don't activate it. Then adding 2 back (0,1,2) activates. Then remove 0 (1,2: light off). Remove 1 (2 alone: light off). So 2 alone doesn't. Later, putting 0 and 2 (after 4 is removed) activates the light. So 0 and 2 together activate. Therefore, both 0 and 2 are blickets. The rule might be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. \n\nNow, what about object 7? The user didn't test object 7 at all. Since 7 was never put on the machine, there's no direct evidence. But the user's goal is to determine which are blickets. Since 0 and 2 seem to be blickets (as their combination activates the machine), but without testing 7, can we infer anything? \n\nIf the rule is that two blickets are needed, and the known blickets are 0 and 2, then 7 might not be a blicket unless there's evidence. However, if the rule is different, like the sum of some property, but given the interactions, the most plausible rule is that the machine turns on when two or more blickets are present. Since 0 and 2 together activate it, and each alone doesn't. \n\nTherefore, object 7 hasn't been tested, but since it's not part of any active combinations, and there's no evidence that it's a blicket, the answer should be False."}
