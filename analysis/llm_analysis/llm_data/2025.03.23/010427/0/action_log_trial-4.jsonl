You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on top of the machine, object 3 is on top of the machine, object 4 is on the floor, object 5 is on the floor, object 6 is on top of the machine, object 7 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> take 3 off machine\n3 is not a recognized object. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take 6 off machine\n6 is not a recognized object. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take 2 off machine\n2 is not a recognized object. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take object 0 off machine\nobject 0 is already on the floor. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take object 3 off machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take object 2 off machine\nYou took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n---\n\nGiven the observations so far, and the list of hypothesis (hypothesis space), take an action which will disprove the existing hypothesis.\n\nDirectly output the answer, ensure only one answer is included.\nOutput the action in the format '> action'.
