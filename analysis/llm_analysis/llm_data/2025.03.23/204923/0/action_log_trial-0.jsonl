Then they placed objects 0 through 4 one by one onto the machine. The machine's light turned on only after putting object 4 on. Hmm, maybe the rule is that a specific number of objects need to be on the machine? Or perhaps certain objects are blickets and their combination activates the machine.\n\nWait, when they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. But before that, objects 0-3 were already there. So maybe object 4 is a blicket, and the presence of at least one blicket turns the machine on? But then why didn't the machine turn on when they placed object 0,1,2, or 3? Unless those aren't blickets. Since the machine only turned on when object 4 was added, that suggests that object 4 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. \n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Let me think. The user put all objects 0-4 on the machine, and the light turned on when 4 was added. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket. But I need to test other combinations to confirm. For example, if I take object 4 off, does the machine turn off? Then putting it back would turn it on again. Alternatively, maybe multiple blickets are required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of some property of the objects (like their numbers) reaches a certain threshold. But since the numbers are arbitrary, that's less likely. The problem states that blickets have blicktness, so the presence of at least one blicket on the machine turns it on. \n\nSo, the current setup has objects 0-4 on the machine, and it's on. To test if object 4 is the only blicket, I can try removing it and see if the machine turns off. Let's try taking object 4 off. If the machine turns off, then object 4 is a blicket. Then I can test others by adding them back one by one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple blickets. But since adding object 4 was the trigger, perhaps it's the key. Let me proceed step by step. The next action should be to remove object 4 and see if the machine turns off. That would confirm if it's a blicket.

The user is trying to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine. So far, they've put objects 0-4 on the machine. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then when they took it off, it turned off again, and putting it back turned it on. That suggests that object 4 is a blicket because it's directly causing the machine to turn on. \n\nBut maybe there's more to the rule. The initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but when they took it off, the machine was off. Then adding 0-4, only when 4 was added did it turn on. So maybe the rule is that only one blicket is needed, and 4 is the key. But maybe there are other blickets. Let's test other objects.\n\nWait, the user might want to check if other objects also work. For example, maybe object 5 was a blicket but when taken off, the machine turned off. But since when they put 4 on, it turned on again, maybe 4 is a blicket. But perhaps the rule is that any blicket on the machine turns it on. So if there are multiple blickets, the machine is on as long as at least one is present.\n\nTo confirm, maybe try putting object 5 back on. Let's see if that also works. The current state has object 4 on the machine, which is on. If I take 4 off and put 5 on, does the machine stay on? Let's try that. Alternatively, putting another object with 4 to see if combination matters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket is needed. But since putting 4 alone turned it on, that might not be the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's last action was putting object 4 back on the machine, and the light is on. Now, the next step is to test other objects. Let's try putting object 5 on the machine again. Since initially, object 5 was on the machine but the light was off. When they took it off, the light was off. But when they added 4, it turned on. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. Let's test that.\n\nSo the next step could be to take object 4 off and put 5 on, then see if the machine stays on. If it doesn't, then 5 isn't a blicket. Alternatively, put 5 along with 4 to see if they both work together.\n\nAlternatively, test another object. Let's try putting object 6 on the machine with 4. If the machine stays on, maybe 6 isn't a blicket. But to confirm, perhaps remove 4 and see if the machine turns off, indicating 6 isn't a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want to check if other objects besides 4 are blickets. Let's try putting object 0 again. Wait, when they first put 0-3 on, the machine was off until 4 was added. So maybe 4 is the only blicket so far. But maybe there are others. Let's try putting object 5 on the machine now, along with 4. If the machine is already on because of 4, adding 5 won't change it. But if 5 is a blicket, then even if 4 is removed, 5 could keep it on. \n\nAlternatively, take 4 off and put 5 on. Let's see:\n\nTake object 4 off machine, then put object 5 on machine. If the machine turns on, then 5 is a blicket. If not, then it's not. Since initially, when 5 was on the machine, the light was off, but maybe that was because other conditions weren't met. Wait, the initial state had object 5 on the machine but the machine was off. So that suggests that 5 alone isn't a blicket. But maybe when combined with others?\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that two blickets are needed. But in the previous steps, when 4 was alone, the machine was on, so that contradicts. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that any single blicket turns it on, so 4 is a blicket, and others might not be. To confirm, test another object. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine with 4. If the machine stays on, then 1 isn't a blicket. But if removing 4 and leaving 1, the machine turns off, so 1 isn't a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want to check object 5 again.

That suggests object 4 is a blicket because it's directly causing the machine to turn on when present.\n\nBut maybe there's more to the rule. The initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but when taken off, the machine was off. So maybe object 5 isn't a blicket. The user has tested objects 0-4, but objects 6 and 7 haven't been tested yet. They need to check if other objects can also activate the machine or if it's only object 4. \n\nWait, the current state has object 4 on the machine, and the light is on. To test others, maybe they should remove object 4 and see if another object can work. Alternatively, add another object with 4 to see if multiple are needed. But since the machine turned on only when 4 was added, it might be a single blicket rule. However, to confirm, they should test other objects. Let's try putting object 6 on the machine while 4 is there, then see if removing 4 turns it off. Or maybe test object 6 alone. \n\nAlternatively, the user might need to check if combinations are required. Since the first time when objects 0-3 were on, the machine was off until 4 was added, maybe only 4 is sufficient. But to be thorough, they should test objects 5,6,7. Let's try putting object 5 on the machine. If it's not a blicket, the machine stays off unless 4 is there. \n\nWait, the current setup has object 4 on the machine. Let's try taking object 4 off and putting another object (like 5) on. If the machine stays off, then 5 isn't a blicket. Then try 6 and 7. \n\nSo the next step could be to take object 4 off and see if the machine turns off (which it should), then test another object. Let's start by removing 4 to check its effect again. But the user already did that before. Maybe now, after putting 4 back, they can try adding another object. \n\nAlternatively, the user might want to test object 5. Since it was initially on the machine but the machine was off, maybe it's not a blicket. But when they took it off, the machine was off. So perhaps 5 isn't a blicket. \n\nNow, to check objects 6 and 7. Let's try putting object 6 on the machine. If the machine turns on when 6 is there without 4, then 6 is a blicket. Otherwise, not. \n\nSo the next command could be putting object 6 on the machine. Let's see. The current objects on the machine are 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, no, when they first put 0 on, then 1, etc., up to 4. So all objects 0-4 are on the machine when they put 4 on, which caused the machine to turn on. Then they took 4 off, so the machine turned off. Then put 4 back, so now the machine is on again. Wait, but when they put 4 on again, were the others still there? Let me retrace:\n\nThe user started by taking object5 off the machine. Then put 0 on machine (so 0 is there). Then put 1 on, so now 0 and 1. Then 2, 3, and 4. So when they put 4 on, all objects 0-4 are on the machine, and the machine turned on. Then they took 4 off, so 0-3 remain, and the machine turned off. Then putting 4 back (so 0-4 again) turned it on again. \n\nSo the presence of 4 is necessary. But maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is present. Since adding 4 made it work, but when 4 was removed, it turned off. So 4 is a blicket. But maybe others are also blickets. To check, perhaps remove 4 and see if others can activate it. \n\nAlternatively, try putting object 5 on the machine. Let's see.

The initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but taking it off didn't change the state (the light was off). So maybe object 5 isn't a blicket. The other objects (0-3) were all placed on the machine before object 4, but the machine only turned on when 4 was added. That implies that maybe only certain objects (like 4) are blickets, and the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. \n\nHowever, I should check other objects to confirm. For example, maybe there are multiple blickets. Let's test another object. Since object 4 works alone, perhaps others do too. Let's try putting object 0 alone on the machine to see if it turns on. Wait, earlier when they put object 0 on first, the light was off. Then adding 1, 2, 3 didn't change it until 4 was added. So maybe only 4 is a blicket so far. \n\nBut maybe the rule is that multiple blickets need to be present. Let's see. If I put object 4 and another object together, does it still work? Let's try putting object 0 and 4 together. But first, let's clear the machine. The current state is object 4 is on the machine, and the light is on. Let's take object 4 off, then put another object (like 0) on, then see if adding 4 again makes a difference. Wait, but the user might need to test other combinations. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that any single blicket turns it on. Since object 4 works alone, that's possible. \n\nBut to confirm, I should test another object. Let's try putting object 1 alone on the machine. If the machine doesn't turn on, then it's not a blicket. So the next step should be to remove object 4, then test another object. Let me see the current state. The last command was putting object 4 back on, so the machine is on. To test another object, I need to take 4 off first. Let's do that.

From the previous steps, when they put object 4 on the machine, the light turned on. Then when they took it off, the light turned off again. That suggests that object 4 is a blicket because it seems to activate the machine by itself. But maybe there's more to the rule? Let me think.\n\nThe initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but when they took it off, the machine was off. Then they put objects 0-4 on the machine one by one. Wait, actually, they put objects 0,1,2,3, and then 4. When they put 4 on, the machine turned on. So maybe object 4 is a blicket. But maybe the rule is that only certain objects need to be present. \n\nWait, when they put objects 0,1,2,3 on the machine first (all of them), and then added 4, the machine turned on. So maybe the presence of object 4 is necessary. But when they took 4 off, the machine turned off. That suggests that 4 alone can activate it. So maybe 4 is a blicket, and the rule is that any single blicket on the machine turns it on. But maybe there are other blickets too. \n\nBut let's check other objects. The user hasn't tested objects 5,6,7 yet. Object 5 was initially on the machine but when taken off, the machine was off. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. Let's test another object. Maybe try putting object 0 alone on the machine to see if it works. If the machine doesn't turn on, then 0 isn't a blicket. \n\nSo the next step should be to test another object. Let's try putting object 0 on the machine by itself. If the light stays off, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then try object 1, etc. But since the user already put 0,1,2,3 on the machine before adding 4, maybe the combination of those didn't work until 4 was added. That suggests that 4 is necessary. But maybe the rule requires at least one blicket. Since 4 alone works, it's a blicket. Let's confirm by testing others. \n\nSo now, after taking 4 off, the machine is off. Let's try putting object 0 on the machine alone. If it doesn't turn on, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then try 1, etc. Let's proceed step by step. The next command should be to put object 0 on the machine again, but alone. Wait, but currently, after the last step, all the objects except 4 and 5 are on the machine? Wait, let me check the previous steps again. \n\nLooking back: The user started by taking object5 off the machine. Then put 0,1,2,3,4 on the machine. Wait, the sequence was:\n\nAfter taking object5 off, the machine was off. Then they put object0 on, then 1, 2, 3, then 4. So when they put 4 on, the machine turned on. Then they took 4 off, and the machine turned off again. Then put 4 back on, and it turned on. Then they took it off again, leading to the current state where the machine is off, and objects 0,1,2,3 are still on the machine? Or were they removed?\n\nWait, the user's actions:\n\n1. take object5 off machine: now object5 is on floor, others (0-4,6,7 on floor except 5 was on machine initially. Wait, initial state had object5 on machine. After taking it off, all objects 0-7 are on floor except 5 was moved to floor. So after that, the user starts putting objects on the machine:\n\nput 0 on machine (now 0 is on machine, others on floor except 5 is now on floor?)\n\nThen put 1 on machine (so 0 and 1 on machine), then 2, 3, then 4. When they put 4 on, the machine turned on. So when all objects 0-4 are on the machine, but the machine turned on when 4 was added. Then taking 4 off turns it off again. Then putting 4 back on turns it on again. Then taking 4 off again, so now the machine is off, and the objects on the machine would be 0,1,2,3 (since when they took 4 off the last time, the others were still there?

Then I put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When I put object 4 on, the light turned on. Then when I took it off, the light turned off again. That suggests that object 4 might be a blicket because it seems to activate the machine when placed alone.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to the rule. The machine turned on only when object 4 was on it. Let me test other objects to see if they also work. Maybe I should try putting other objects with or without object 4 to see combinations. But first, let's confirm if object 4 is indeed a blicket. Since putting it alone turned the machine on, that's a strong indicator. \n\nNow, I should check other objects. Let's try putting object 0 and 4 together. If the machine turns on, maybe multiple blickets are needed or it's an OR condition. But first, let's see. Wait, right now, after taking object 4 off, the machine is off. Let me put object 4 back on first. Wait, the last step was taking object 4 off, so the machine is off. Let me try putting object 0 and 4 together. But first, I need to put object 0 on. Wait, object 0 was already on the machine when I put it there earlier, but when I added the others up to 4, but maybe I need to check combinations. Hmm, perhaps I should test each object individually first. \n\nWait, when I first put objects 0,1,2,3, and then 4, the machine turned on when 4 was added. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is needed. But maybe there are others. Let me test object 5 again. Since initially, object 5 was on the machine, but when I took it off, the machine was off. But maybe that was because when I took it off, I then started adding others. Wait, the initial state had object 5 on the machine, but when I took it off, the machine stayed off. So maybe object 5 isn't a blicket. \n\nNow, to check other objects. Let me try putting object 1 alone on the machine. Wait, earlier when I put object 1 on, the light was off. But maybe I need to test each one individually. Let me try putting object 0 alone. Let me take all others off first. Wait, currently, after the last steps, the objects on the machine might be a mess. Let me check the current state. Wait, the user can use 'look' to see the current setup. Oh right, I should have used 'look' to check where everything is. Since the last command was taking object 4 off, and before that, after putting 0-4 on, but then taking 4 off, maybe the others are still on? Wait, no. Let me think through the steps again:\n\nStarting over:\n\n- The initial state had object5 on the machine, others on floor.\n\nUser first took object5 off machine. Then put 0 on machine. Then 1, 2, 3, 4. So after putting 4 on, all objects 0-4 are on the machine, and the light turned on when 4 was added. Then the user took 4 off, so the machine turned off. Then put 4 back on, so it turned on again. Then took 4 off again, so now the machine is off. \n\nBut the current state: after the last command \"take object4 off machine\", the machine has objects 0,1,2,3 on it? Because when you put each on, they stay unless taken off. Wait, when you put object0 on machine, then 1,2,3,4. So when you take 4 off, the others (0-3) are still on the machine. Then when you put 4 back, it's added again. Then taking 4 off again leaves 0-3 on the machine. Wait, but in the last steps:\n\nAfter putting 4 on machine (step where light turned on), then taking 4 off (light off). Then putting 4 back (light on again). Then taking 4 off again (light off). \n\nSo currently, after the last \"take object4 off machine\", the machine has objects 0,1,2,3 on it (since those were added and never taken off). Because when you put an object on, it stays until taken off. So the current state is: objects 0,1,2,3 are on the machine, and 4 is on the floor. Object", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Then I put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When I put object 4 on, the machine turned on. When I took it off, it turned off again. That suggests that object 4 is a blicket because it's making the machine work when it's present. But maybe there's more to the rule. \n\nWait, but when I put objects 0-3 on first, the machine was still off. Only when I added object 4 did it turn on. So maybe the rule is that at least one blicket needs to be on the machine. Since object 4 is the one that turned it on, it's likely a blicket. But I should test other objects to see if they can also turn it on. \n\nI should try putting other objects alone to see if they work. Let's try object 0. Take everything off first. Right now, after taking object 4 off, the machine is off. Let me put object 0 back on by itself. Wait, currently, objects 0,1,2,3 are still on the machine? Wait, no.

Then I took 4 off again, and now the machine is off. The objects on the machine now: after taking 4 off the last time, the other objects (0,1,2,3) were still on the machine? Or were they taken off? Hmm, the initial steps: \n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- Object 5 was on the machine. The user took it off. Then put 0,1,2,3,4 on the machine one by one. So after putting 4 on, all objects 0-4 are on the machine. Then taking 4 off would leave 0-3 on. Wait, but when the user put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then taking 4 off made it off again. Wait, but if 0-3 were still on, then why did the machine turn off when 4 was removed? That suggests that maybe 4 is necessary, so perhaps the rule is that only object 4 is a blicket, and others aren't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when exactly one blicket is present. But in the first test, when 0-4 were all on, adding 4 made it on. Wait, perhaps the initial sequence was that putting 0,1,2,3 on didn't do anything, but adding 4 turned it on. So 4 is a blicket, and others aren't. \n\nBut to confirm, I should test other objects. Let's try putting object 0 alone on the machine. Let me first take all the objects off except 0. Wait, but currently, after the last steps, the user took object 4 off, and the machine is off. The objects on the machine now: after putting 0,1,2,3,4 on, then taking 4 off, the machine turned off. But when the user took 4 off again (the last step), the machine is off. Are the other objects still on? Let me retrace:\n\nAfter the first sequence:\n\n- After putting 0 on, machine off.\n\n- Then 1, still off.\n\n- 2, off.\n\n- 3, off.\n\n- 4 on, machine on.\n\nThen taking 4 off: machine off. Then putting 4 back on: machine on.\n\nThen taking 4 off again: machine off. \n\nBut the objects 0,1,2,3 were still on the machine during all this? Or were they taken off? Wait, when you put an object on the machine, does it stack them, or is the machine a single slot? The problem says \"objects can be on the machine or the floor\", so the machine can have multiple objects on it. So when you put each object on, they all stay. \n\nSo when the user put 0,1,2,3,4 on the machine, all five are on it. Then taking 4 off leaves 0-3 on.

Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then taking it off turned it off again, so that suggests object 4 is a blicket. But maybe there's more to the rule?\n\nWait, the initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but when they took it off, the machine was off. So maybe object 5 isn't a blicket. Then when they added objects 0-4, only when 4 was added did it turn on. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket? But maybe there are others. Let me check.\n\nThe user tried putting 0,1,2,3, then 4. The light came on only when 4 was added. Then taking 4 off turns it off. So that suggests 4 is a blicket. But maybe there's another object that also works. Let's test others. Maybe the rule is that only one blicket is needed, so if there's at least one blicket, the machine turns on. But to confirm, maybe I should test other objects. For example, try putting object 0 alone. If the machine doesn't turn on, then 0 isn't a blicket. Similarly for 1,2,3. Let's try putting object 0 on the machine now. Since the user's last step had all objects 0-4 except 4 was just taken off. Wait, the current state after the last command: after taking object 4 off, the machine is off. The objects on the machine now are 0,1,2,3? Wait, let me retrace:\n\nInitially, objects 0-7 are on floor except 5 on machine. Then user took 5 off, so all 0-7 on floor. Then they put 0 on machine, then 1, 2, 3, 4. So when they put 4 on, the machine turned on. Then they took 4 off, so the machine turned off. Then put 4 back on, so on again. Then took 4 off again, so now the machine is off. The objects on the machine now would be 0,1,2,3? Because when they added 4, they took it off again. Wait, let me track step by step:\n\n1. Start: 5 on machine, others on floor.\n\n2. Take 5 off machine: now all 0-7 on floor.\n\n3. Put 0 on machine: machine has 0.\n\n4. Put 1 on machine: now 0 and 1 on machine.\n\n5. Put 2 on machine: 0,1,2.\n\n6. Put 3 on machine: 0,1,2,3.\n\n7. Put 4 on machine: now all 0-4 on machine. Then the light turned on. So adding 4 caused it to turn on.\n\n8. Take 4 off: now 0-3 on machine, light off.\n\n9. Put 4 back on: light on again.\n\n10. Take 4 off again: now 0-3 on machine, light off.\n\nSo currently, after the last command (taking 4 off), the machine has objects 0,1,2,3 on it, and the light is off. The user's last valid command was taking 4 off, leading to the machine being off. Now, to test if any of 0-3 are blickets, we can try removing some and see. Alternatively, test individual objects.\n\nSince when only 4 was present, the machine was on. But when 0-3 were there without 4, it was off. So 4 is a blicket. But maybe others are too. Let's try putting object 0 alone on the machine. If the machine doesn't turn on, then 0 isn't a blicket. Let's do that.\n\nSo the current state: objects 0,1,2,3 are on the machine, and the light is off. To test object 0, we need to remove the others. Let's take off 1,2,3 first. Then put 0 alone and see.\n\nBut the user might have limited steps. Let me see how many steps are left. The user has used 10 steps so far (including the invalid ones, but the count might be different). Since the user is supposed to have 32 steps, there's time. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, to isolate object 0, take off 1,2,3. Let's do that:\n\nTake 1 off: now 0,2,3", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Ensure only one command is included.", "response_message": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So far, I've been putting different objects on the machine to see which ones make it turn on. The user started by taking object 5 off the machine, which was already on it, but that didn't turn it on. Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When object 4 was added, the machine turned on. Then when they took object 4 off, it turned off again. Putting it back turned it on again. \n\nHmm, so object 4 seems like a blicket because whenever it's on the machine alone, the light turns on. But when they put object 5 back on later, the light was off. Wait, maybe there's more to the rule. Maybe it's not just a single object. Let me think.\n\nThe initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but when taken off, the machine was off. So maybe object 5 isn't a blicket. The user tried putting objects 0-4 on, and only when 4 was added did it turn on. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket so far. But maybe there are others. Let's test other objects. \n\nWait, the user tried putting object 5 on again after taking 4 off, and the machine stayed off. So 5 isn't a blicket. Now, maybe I should check the other objects. Let's try putting object 0 alone on the machine. When they first put 0 on, the machine was off. Then adding 1, 2, 3, then 4 turned it on. So maybe the rule is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. Since adding 4 made it work, 4 is a blicket. But maybe there are others. Let's test object 0 again by itself. \n\nThe user hasn't tested objects 0-3 alone except when they were added in sequence. Let me try putting object 0 alone. The current state after the last command (putting 5 on machine) has the machine off. So if I take all others off except 0, but maybe I need to clear the machine first. Wait, the current objects on the machine are object 5. Let me take that off first. \n\nWait, the last command was putting object 5 on the machine, which resulted in the light being off. So to test object 0, I should take object 5 off, then put 0 on alone. Let me do that. \n\nSo first, take object 5 off the machine. Then put object 0 on. If the light stays off, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then try object 1, etc. But since the user has limited steps, maybe I should proceed step by step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that only object 4 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. But to confirm, I should check other objects. Let's try putting object 1 alone. Let me see the current state. The user's last action was putting object 5 on the machine, which is off. So first, take object 5 off. Then put object 1 on. If the light is off, then 1 isn't a blicket. Then proceed similarly for others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that multiple blickets are needed. But since adding 4 alone turned it on, probably it's a single blicket. But to be thorough, I should check others. Let me try putting object 2 alone. \n\nWait, but the user might have limited steps. Let me see how many steps are left. The user has used 12 steps so far (the initial steps up to the last \"put object 5 on machine\" was step 12). Since the total allowed is 32, there's time. \n\nSo the next step should be to test another object. Let's try object 1. To do that, first, remove object 5 from the machine. So the command would be \"take object 5 off machine\". Then put object 1 on. Let's do that first.\n</think>\n\n> take object 5 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

When I first took object 5 off the machine, the light was off. Then I put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When I put object 4 on, the light turned on. Taking it off turned it off again. That suggests object 4 is a blicket because it seems to activate the machine by itself.\n\nBut then when I tried object 5 again later, putting it on didn't work. So maybe 4 is a definite blicket. But maybe there are others. I need to test the other objects more thoroughly. Let me check objects 0,1,2,3 again. Maybe some of them are also blickets but I didn't notice because they were on when 4 was there. \n\nWait, when I first put 0-4 on, the machine only turned on when 4 was added. That might mean that only 4 is a blicket. But maybe the rule is different. Like, maybe it requires multiple blickets. But in that case, when I had all objects 0-4 on, including 4, the light was on. But when I took 4 off, it turned off. So that suggests that 4 alone is sufficient. \n\nHmm, but maybe there's another object that also works. Let me test object 5 again. Wait, when I put object 5 on the machine after taking it off, the light was off. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. Let me try putting other objects alone. For example, put object 0 alone on the machine and see if it turns on. \n\nWait, earlier when I put object 0 on first, the light was off. Then adding 1, 2, 3, and then 4 turned it on. So maybe only 4 is a blicket. But I should test each object individually to confirm. Let me try putting object 1 alone on the machine. \n\nSo next step: take all objects off except object 1 and see. Wait, but I need to do this step by step. Let me first take all objects off the machine. Then put object 0 alone. \n\nWait, right now, after the last command, object 5 was taken off, and the machine is off. The current state is: objects 0-3 and 5-7 are on the floor, and object 4 is on the machine? Wait, no. Let me check the previous steps again. \n\nWait, after the user's first action was taking object 5 off the machine. Then they put 0 on, then 1, 2, 3, then 4, which turned it on. Then they took 4 off, put it back, etc. Then later, after some invalid commands, they put object 5 back on, but it didn't work, then took it off again. \n\nThe current state might be that object 4 is on the machine? Or maybe not. Let me track the steps again step by step:\n\n1. Start: objects 0-7 on floor except 5 on machine.\n2. User takes 5 off machine. Now machine has nothing, light off.\n3. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n4. Put 1 on (so now 0 and 1 are on machine?), but the light is still off.\nWait, but the machine's state is only mentioned when the action is done. Let me retrace:\n\nAfter step 3: put object 0 on machine. The light is off.\n\nThen step 4: put object 1 on machine. Still off.\n\nStep 5: put 2 on, still off.\n\nStep 6: put 3 on, still off.\n\nStep 7: put 4 on machine. Now the light turns on. So when 4 is added, the machine turns on. That suggests that 4 is a blicket. \n\nThen step 8: take 4 off, light turns off again. \n\nPutting it back (step 9) turns it on again. \n\nThen after some invalid commands (maybe the user was trying other things but the system didn't process them?), then putting 5 on again didn't work. \n\nNow, the current state after the last command (taking 5 off) would have the machine's state as off, and object 5 is off the machine. \n\nBut to confirm, I need to check which objects are currently on the machine. Let me think: after step 9 (putting 4 back on), the machine has 0,1,2,3,4 on it? Or were they removed? Wait, when you put objects on the machine, they stay unless taken off.

The user is trying to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine. So far, they've tried putting objects 0 through 4 on the machine. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then taking it off turned it off again. That suggests object 4 is a blicket because it's directly causing the machine to turn on.\n\nBut wait, when they put multiple objects (0-4) on the machine, the light came on when object 4 was added. So maybe the rule is that only one blicket is needed? Or maybe it's an \"any\" rule where any blicket on the machine turns it on. Since object 4 alone works, that's probably a blicket. \n\nNow, they tried object 5 earlier, which was initially on the machine but when they put it back, the machine didn't turn on. So object 5 isn't a blicket. The other objects (0,1,2,3) didn't cause the machine to turn on when placed, so they might not be blickets either. But maybe there's more to the rule. \n\nWait, when they first put 0-4 on the machine, the light turned on when 4 was added. So maybe 4 is the only blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is present. But to confirm, maybe test other combinations. For example, putting object 4 with others to see if it still works. But since the user has limited steps, maybe they should check the remaining objects (6 and 7). They haven't been tested yet. \n\nSo the next step should be to test objects 6 and 7. Let's try putting object 6 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then 6 is a blicket. If not, then maybe it's not. Same with 7.

The first thing I did was take object 5 off the machine because it was already there when I started. Then I tried putting objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When I put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then I took it off and put it back, and the same thing happened. So that suggests object 4 is a blicket because it can activate the machine by itself.\n\nBut then I tried taking object 4 off and putting other objects like 5, 6, and 7 on, but the machine didn't turn on. So maybe those aren't blickets. Wait, but maybe there's more to the rule. The machine turned on only when object 4 was the only one on it. What if there are other blickets that require combinations? Hmm, but so far, only object 4 has worked alone. Let me check the others again. Maybe I should test combinations. For example, put object 0 and 1 together. If the machine turns on, then maybe it's an OR or AND rule. But since time is limited, maybe I should confirm if object 4 is the only blicket. Wait, but the problem says there are multiple blickets. Oh, right, the user mentioned \"blickets\" plural. So maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, when I put objects 0-4 on the machine, the light turned on only when I added object 4. So maybe the rule is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. Since object 4 works alone, it's a blicket. But maybe others are too. Let me test another object. Like object 5. When I put it on alone, the machine was off. So probably not a blicket. What about object 6 or 7? They also didn't work alone. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket? But the problem states there are multiple. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I first put objects 0-3 on the machine, then adding 4 turned it on. Maybe the rule is that the machine needs exactly four objects? But no, because when I took 4 off and put it back, it worked again. Or maybe the number isn't the key. Alternatively, maybe the presence of a blicket (like 4) is enough. But then why didn't the machine turn on when I had 0-3 on it? Because 4 was off. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket, and the rule is any blicket on the machine turns it on. But the problem says \"blickets\" plural, so maybe I need to check others again. Maybe I missed another object. Let me try putting object 2 and 4 together. Wait, but I need to do this step by step. Let me try putting object 0 and 4. If the machine stays on, then maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Alternatively, maybe I should test each object individually again. Let me try putting object 1 alone on the machine. Wait, earlier when I put object 1 on, the machine was off. So maybe only 4 is a blicket. But the problem might have more. Maybe I need to check all objects again. Let me try putting object 5 again. Wait, I did that and it didn't work. Hmm. Maybe the rule is that only one blicket exists here, but the problem says \"blickets\", so perhaps I made a mistake in my tests. Alternatively, maybe the initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but when I took it off, maybe that was a blicket. Wait, when I first started, object 5 was on the machine, but when I took it off, the machine was off. Then when I added 4, it turned on. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that two blickets need to be present. But since 4 alone works, that can't be. Maybe the rule is \"at least one\", so 4 is the only one. But the problem might have more. Let me think again. The user hasn't said how many blickets there are, just that I need to find them. Since I only found 4 so far, maybe others are there but I need to test more combinations. For example, maybe object 0 is a blicket but requires another. Let me try putting 0 and 4 together.

Ensure only one command is included.", "response_message": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So far, I've been putting different objects on the machine to see which ones make it turn on. The first thing I did was take object 5 off the machine because it was already there when I started. Then I tried putting objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When I put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then I took it off and put it back, and it worked again. That suggests that object 4 is a blicket because it can activate the machine by itself.\n\nBut then I tried object 5 again, putting it on after taking it off, and the machine didn't turn on. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. Then I tried objects 6 and 7, but neither of them turned the machine on either. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket so far. Wait, but maybe there's more to the rule. The machine turned on only when object 4 was present. So the rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on it. Since object 4 works alone, it's definitely a blicket. The others (0,1,2,3,5,6,7) don't seem to work when tested individually. \n\nBut I should check if there's a combination required. Maybe two non-blickets together can activate it? Let me test that. For example, put object 0 and 1 together. Wait, but I haven't tested combinations yet. Since I only have 32 steps, I need to be efficient. Let me see: I've used up a bunch of steps already. Maybe the rule is simply that only object 4 is a blicket and the machine needs at least one blicket. Since when I put 4 alone, it works, and others don't. So maybe that's the case. But I should confirm by testing another combination. Like putting 4 with another object to see if it still works. Let me try putting object 0 and 4 together. Wait, but first, I need to clear the machine. Let me take off any objects. Currently, objects 6 and 7 are on the machine. Let me take them off first. \n\nWait, the last command was putting 7 on the machine, so the machine has 6 and 7. The light is off. So I should take them off. Let me do that. But the user's last input was putting 7 on, so the current state is objects 6 and 7 on the machine. The light is off. So to test 4 with another object, I need to first remove 6 and 7. Let me take them off. But the user's next step is to output a command. The user's last message ended with an invalid command (None), and now they want me to output the next command. \n\nHmm, maybe I should first clear the machine. Let me take object 6 off the machine. Wait, but the user's last command was putting 7 on, so the machine has both 6 and 7. To take them off, I need to do take each off. But perhaps the user wants to test another combination. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that only object 4 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when it's present. Since all other tests didn't work, maybe that's the case. But to confirm, perhaps I should test another object in combination. Let me try putting object 4 and 5 together. Let's see. \n\nFirst, I need to remove 6 and 7. Let me take object 7 off first. So the next command would be '> take object 7 off machine'. But the user wants only one command. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to proceed to the answer. Wait, the user's instruction says to \"Directly output the command in the format '> command'. Ensure only one command is included.\" So perhaps after the last steps, the next logical step is to test another combination. But given the current state, maybe the user is trying to see if there are other blickets. Since objects 6 and 7 are on the machine and it's off, perhaps they are not blickets. So the only blicket is 4. Therefore, the answer would be that the blickets are object 4, and the rule is at least one blicket must be present. But the user hasn't asked for the answer yet; they are still in the process of commands. Wait, the user's last message says \"Directly output the command in the format '> command'...\" So maybe they want the next step in the process. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there are any other blickets.

The first thing I did was take object 5 off the machine because it was already there when I started. Then I tried putting objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When I put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then I took it off and put it back, and the machine turned on again. That suggests that object 4 is a blicket because it consistently activates the machine.\n\nBut then I tried object 5 again, and when I put it on, the machine stayed off. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. Then I tried objects 6 and 7, but even when I put them on, the machine didn't turn on. Wait, but when I took object 7 off, the machine was still off. Hmm, maybe I need to test combinations. \n\nWait, the rule might be that only certain objects (like 4) are blickets, and having at least one of them on the machine turns it on. But I should check if there are others. Let me try putting object 4 with another object to see if it's an \"any\" or \"all\" rule. For example, if I put object 0 and 4 together, does it stay on? Or maybe object 4 alone is enough. Since when I had objects 0-3 on, the machine was off, but adding 4 turned it on. So maybe 4 is the only blicket so far. \n\nBut I need to check the others again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me try putting object 6 alone on the machine. Wait, I already tried that and it didn't work. What about object 7? Same result. What about object 1? Let me try putting object 1 alone again. Wait, earlier when I put object 1 on, the machine was off. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another rule. Like, maybe two objects need to be on together. But when I put 0-4, the machine turned on only when 4 was added. So maybe 4 is the key. Let me confirm by testing other combinations. Let's try putting object 4 and another non-blicket, like 0. If the machine turns on, that supports that 4 alone is sufficient. \n\nWait, I should also check if there are other blickets. Let me try putting object 2 and 4 together. But first, I need to clear the machine. Right now, objects 6 and 7 are on the machine? Wait, looking back, after putting 6 and 7 on, the machine was off. Then I took 7 off, so now objects 6 and 0-4 might be on? Wait, no. Let me retrace:\n\nAfter putting 0-4, then 5, then 6 and 7. Wait, actually, the last steps were putting 6 and 7 on the machine. Then I took 7 off. So currently, object 6 is still on the machine. The machine is off. So maybe I should take object 6 off and try putting 4 again. Let me do that. \n\nWait, the user's last command was taking 7 off, leaving 6 on. So the current state is object 6 is on the machine, and the light is off. So to test if 4 is a blicket alone, I can take off 6 and put 4 on. Let me try that. \n\nSo first, take object 6 off. Then put 4 on. If the machine turns on, that confirms 4 is a blicket.

When I put object 5 back on the machine later, the machine didn't turn on. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. Same with 6 and 7\u2014they didn't do anything when I put them on. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket so far. \n\nBut I need to check if there's a combination rule. Like, maybe two blickets need to be on the machine together. But when I put multiple objects on before, like 0-3, the machine was off until I added 4. So maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is present.

Ensure only one command is included.", "response_message": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So far, I've been putting different objects on the machine to see which ones make it turn on. The first thing I did was take object 5 off the machine because it was already there, but that didn't do anything. Then I started testing objects 0 through 4. When I put all of them except 4 on the machine, the light stayed off. But when I added object 4, the light turned on. That suggests that object 4 is a blicket because it activated the machine. \n\nWait, but when I took object 4 off, the light turned off again. Then putting it back turned it on. So that definitely points to object 4 being a blicket. The machine seems to require at least one blicket to be on it to turn on. \n\nNow, I need to check the other objects. I tried object 5 again, but it didn't work. Then I tried objects 6 and 7, but even when both were on the machine, the light stayed off. Taking them off didn't change anything. So maybe those aren't blickets. \n\nHmm, but maybe there's a different rule. Like, maybe multiple blickets are needed? But when I had objects 0-4 (including 4) on the machine, the light was on. But when I took 4 off, it turned off. So maybe it's just any single blicket. Since only object 4 works so far. \n\nWait, maybe I should test other combinations. Like, try putting object 4 with others to see if it's the only one. Let me try putting object 0 and 4 together. Wait, but I need to make sure. Let me see the current state. The last commands were taking objects 6 and 7 off, so now the machine probably has none except maybe object 4? Wait, let me retrace:\n\nAfter the last steps, the user took object 7 and 6 off the machine, so the machine is empty now. The light is off. So now, I should test individual objects again. Let me try putting object 0 on the machine again. If I put object 0 on, the light stays off. Then try object 1, same. Object 2, 3, same. Only when I put 4 on, it turns on. So that confirms 4 is a blicket. \n\nWhat about the others? Maybe there are more blickets. Let me check object 5 again. Put it on alone, but it didn't work before. Same with 6 and 7. So maybe only 4 is a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets? But in the first test when all 0-4 were on (including 4), the light was on. But if 4 is the only one, then even with others, it's still on. So that would fit. \n\nSo the conclusion is that object 4 is a blicket, and the others aren't. The rule is that at least one blicket must be present. \n\nTherefore, the next step is to confirm that other objects don't work. Since I already tested 5,6,7, maybe I should check if combining non-blickets doesn't work. But since the user is probably expecting the answer now, maybe I should just list the blickets as 4. \n\nWait, but the problem might have more than one. Did I miss any tests? Let me see. The user tried putting 0-4 on, but the light turned on when adding 4. So maybe when 4 was added, that's when it turned on. So the others are not blickets. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the blickets are object 4. So the user should output the command to maybe confirm, but since the problem asks to directly output the command, perhaps they need to list the blickets. Wait, no, the user is supposed to output the next command. Wait, the user's last command was taking off 6 and 7, and now the machine is empty. The user might need to test another object, but maybe the assistant has already gathered enough info. Wait, the user's last message says to \"Directly output the command in the format '> command'. Ensure only one command is included.\" So maybe the user is done and needs to answer the question, but the problem is to list the blickets. Wait, no, the initial problem says \"You will be given a problem. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within <>. Please do not write any explanations. ... Directly output the command in the format '> command'.\" Wait, maybe I'm confused.

From the previous steps, they've tried putting several objects on the machine. \n\nFirst, they took object 5 off the machine, which was initially on it, but that didn't turn it on. Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine. When they placed object 4, the machine turned on. Taking it off turned it off again, so that suggests object 4 is a blicket. But maybe there's more to the rule?\n\nThey also tried objects 5, 6, and 7. Putting 5 on didn't work. Then 6 and 7 together also didn't turn it on. Taking them off didn't change anything. So maybe 6 and 7 aren't blickets. But wait, when they put 4 on alone, the machine turned on. So 4 is definitely a blicket. \n\nBut what about the others? Let's see. The initial setup had object 5 on the machine, but when taken off, the machine was off. So maybe 5 isn't a blicket. The user tried putting 0-3 on, but until 4 was added, it turned on. Wait, actually, when they put 0,1,2,3,4 on the machine, the light turned on when 4 was added. But then when they took 4 off, it turned off. So maybe the rule is that only one blicket is needed, and 4 is the only one so far. \n\nBut maybe there are other blickets. Let's check. The user hasn't tested objects 6 and 7 alone. They put both 6 and 7 on, but the machine stayed off. So maybe neither are blickets. But to confirm, maybe test each individually. \n\nWait, the user tried putting 6 on alone? Let me check the steps again. After putting 6 on, the light was off. Then they put 7 on, still off. Then took 7 off, still off. So 6 alone didn't work. So 6 isn't a blicket. \n\nWhat about object 0,1,2,3? When they were all on the machine along with 4, the machine turned on when 4 was added. But maybe those others aren't blickets. To confirm, maybe try putting just one of them, like 0, and see if the machine turns on. If not, then they aren't blickets. \n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. Since the current steps have only tested combinations, maybe the rule is that only object 4 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule requires multiple blickets. But since adding 4 alone turned it on, that suggests it's a single blicket. \n\nSo the possible blickets are only 4. The others (0,1,2,3,5,6,7) aren't. \n\nBut to be thorough, maybe test another object alone. For example, try putting object 0 on the machine by itself. If the machine doesn't turn on, then 0 isn't a blicket. \n\nThe user hasn't done that yet. Let me see the last commands. The last valid command was trying to take off object 6, leaving the machine off. Now, the user needs to test another object. Let's pick object 0. So the next step should be putting object 0 on the machine alone to see if it's a blicket. If not, then proceed to test others. \n\nAlternatively, since time is limited, maybe the answer is that only object 4 is a blicket, and the rule is presence of any blicket. But to confirm, the user should test another object. \n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake in their approach. Let me recount:\n\n- When they put 0,1,2,3,4 on the machine, the light turned on when 4 was added. So before adding 4, the machine was off with 0-3. So those aren't blickets. \n\nThus, the only blicket is 4. The rule is that the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket (object 4) on it. \n\nTherefore, the final answer would list object 4 as the blicket and the rule as \"the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present.\" \n\nBut the user might need to confirm by testing another object. Since in the last steps, they tried 6 and 7 and they didn't work. So I think that's sufficient. \n\nSo the commands already done", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

So, the user is trying to determine which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. From the previous steps, they've tried putting several objects on the machine. \n\nFirst, they took object 5 off the machine, which didn't turn it on. Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Taking it off turned it off again. That suggests object 4 is a blicket because it's necessary for the machine to activate.\n\nThen they tested objects 5, 6, and 7. Putting 5 on didn't work. Objects 6 and 7 also didn't trigger the machine when placed. So maybe only object 4 is a blicket. But wait, maybe there's a combination? Let me check again.\n\nWhen they put 0-4 on, the machine turned on when 4 was added. So maybe the presence of 4 alone is enough. Since taking 4 off turns it off, that supports that 4 is a blicket. The others (0-3,5,6,7) don't seem to have any effect. \n\nThe rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Since only object 4 works, the rule is presence of a blicket (object4).

From the steps taken, the user started by taking object 5 off the machine, which was initially on it. Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then taking it off turned it off again, and putting it back turned it on again. That suggests that object 4 is a blicket because whenever it's on the machine, the light turns on.\n\nThen they tried objects 5, 6, and 7. Putting 5 on didn't do anything, and same with 6 and 7. When they took those off, the light stayed off. So objects 5,6,7 aren't blickets. \n\nNow, for objects 0-3: when they put all of them (0,1,2,3) on the machine together, the light was off until object 4 was added. Wait, actually, when they put 0,1,2,3,4 on, the light turned on only when 4 was added. But when they removed 4, the light turned off. That suggests that maybe the rule is that only object 4 is a blicket, and having it alone or with others is needed. But when they had 0-3 on without 4, the machine was off, so those aren't blickets. So object 0 isn't a blicket. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another rule? Like, maybe multiple blickets are needed? But when 4 was alone, the machine was on. So if 4 alone works, then it's a blicket. The others when tested in combinations (like 0-3) didn't trigger the light until 4 was added. So objects 0,1,2,3 are not blickets. Therefore, object 0 is not a blicket.

From the user's actions, they started by taking object 5 off the machine since it was already there. Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Taking it off turned it off again, and putting it back turned it on again. That suggests object 4 is definitely a blicket because it's controlling the machine.\n\nThen they tried objects 5, 6, and 7. Putting 5 on didn't do anything, same with 6 and 7. Taking them off didn't change anything either. So those probably aren't blickets. \n\nNow, objects 0,1,2,3 were all placed on the machine before 4. The machine only turned on when 4 was added. That implies that maybe the rule is that at least one blicket needs to be on the machine. Since adding 4 made it work, and the others didn't, those (including object 2) might not be blickets. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a different rule. Like maybe multiple blickets are needed? But when they put 4 alone, it worked. So the simplest explanation is that only 4 is a blicket, and the machine turns on if any blicket is present.

Putting it back turned it on again. \n\nThat suggests that object 4 is a blicket because whenever it's on the machine, the light turns on. The other objects (0-3) didn't seem to do anything until 4 was added. When they tested objects 5,6,7, putting them on the machine didn't turn it on. So object 4 is definitely a blicket. The rule might be that only object 4 is a blicket and it needs to be the only one on the machine. Or maybe there's more, but based on the tests, object 4 is definitely a blicket.\n</think>\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

So the user is trying to determine which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. From the commands they've executed, here's what I can gather:\n\nFirst, they started by taking object 5 off the machine. The machine was off, so that didn't help. Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Then taking it off turned it off again, and putting it back turned it on again. That suggests object 4 is a blicket because it's directly causing the machine to turn on when placed.\n\nThen they tried objects 5, 6, and 7. When they put object 5 on the machine, the light stayed off. Same with 6 and 7. Even when they put multiple (like 6 and 7 together), it didn't turn on. So those probably aren't blickets. \n\nThe key here is that only object 4, when placed alone, turned the machine on. Since the machine requires at least one blicket to be on it to turn on, and object 4 does that, it's definitely a blicket. The others (including 5) didn't trigger the machine when tested individually or in combinations (except when 4 was there). So object 5 isn't a blicket. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a combination rule? Like needing two blickets? But in the steps, when they put 0-3 on, the machine was off until 4 was added. So when 0-3 were all on, it was off. Adding 4 turned it on. So maybe the rule is that only one blicket is needed, and 4 is the only one.

From the user's actions, they started by taking object 5 off the machine, which was initially on it. Then they put objects 0 through 4 on the machine one by one. When they put object 4 on, the machine turned on. Taking it off turned it off again, and putting it back turned it on. That suggests object 4 is a blicket because it's controlling the machine's state.\n\nThen they tried objects 5, 6, and 7. When they put object 5 on the machine, the light stayed off. Same with 6 and 7. Even when they took 7 off, nothing changed. So objects 5,6,7 don't seem to activate the machine on their own. Since the machine turned on only with object 4, and turning it off when removed, it's likely that only object 4 is a blicket. The others, including 7, probably aren't.
