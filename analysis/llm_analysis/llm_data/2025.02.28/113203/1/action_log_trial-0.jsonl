The same occurred with object 2 and object 3. However, when object 1 was placed on the machine, the light remained on, suggesting it may not be a blicket. The chi-square analysis shows significant relationships between object 0 and object 3, and between object 2 and object 3, indicating that object 3 is likely related to the activation of the machine. Given that the light turned on with object 3 present, it suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 2154, "total_tokens": 2386}}
