Additionally, the chi-square analysis indicates a strong relationship between object 3 and the other objects, suggesting that it likely shares the attribute of being a blicket. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 2155, "total_tokens": 2349}}
