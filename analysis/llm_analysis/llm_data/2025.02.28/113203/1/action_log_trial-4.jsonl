The chi-square analysis shows strong relationships between the objects, particularly between object 3 and the others. Since the light remained on when object 3 was placed on the machine, it suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 2156, "total_tokens": 2306}}
