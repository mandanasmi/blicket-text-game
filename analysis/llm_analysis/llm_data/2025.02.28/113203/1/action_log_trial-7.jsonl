Additionally, the chi-square analysis shows strong relationships between object 3 and the other objects, suggesting that it likely contributes to the machine's activation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 2157, "total_tokens": 2331}}
