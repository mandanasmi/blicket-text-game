The chi-square analysis shows strong relationships between the objects, particularly between object 3 and the other objects, suggesting that object 3 may also be a blicket. However, since the light was consistently on with object 0 and other combinations, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket without further testing.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 2153, "total_tokens": 2317}}
