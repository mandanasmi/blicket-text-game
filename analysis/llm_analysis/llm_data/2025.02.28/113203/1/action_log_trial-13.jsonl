Additionally, the chi-square analysis shows a strong relationship between object 3 and the other objects, particularly with object 2, which also turned the machine on. The consistent ability of object 3 to activate the machine suggests it is likely a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 2157, "total_tokens": 2334}}
