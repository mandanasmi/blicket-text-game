This suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket. The chi-square analysis also indicates strong relationships between the objects, particularly between object 3 and the others, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 2155, "total_tokens": 2335}}
