The chi-square analysis shows significant relationships between the objects, suggesting that they share a common attribute that activates the machine. Since object 3 was included in the tests and the light was consistently on when it was placed on the machine, it can be concluded that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 2157, "total_tokens": 2281}}
