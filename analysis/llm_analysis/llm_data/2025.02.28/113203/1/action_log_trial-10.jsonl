However, when object 3 was taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that it may not be a blicket on its own. The chi-square analysis shows strong relationships between the objects, particularly between object 3 and the others, suggesting that it may not be a blicket independently.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 2156, "total_tokens": 2342}}
