You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> {'object0': 'unknown', 'object1': 'unknown', 'object2': 'unknown', 'object3': 'unknown'}\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nYou put object 2 on the machine.
