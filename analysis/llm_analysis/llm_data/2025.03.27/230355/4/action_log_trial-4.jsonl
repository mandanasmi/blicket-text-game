There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. Right now, object 1 is on the machine, and the machine's light is off. The other two are on the floor. My goal is to figure out which ones are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the current state. Since object 1 is on the machine but the light is off, maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Or perhaps the rule isn't as simple as having just one blicket on the machine. Maybe the machine requires a combination of certain objects. Alternatively, maybe the rule is more complex, like needing a certain number of blickets, or specific ones.\n\nLet me start by testing the existing setup. If I remove object 1 from the machine and see if the machine's state changes. Wait, but the light is already off. So maybe removing it won't do anything. Alternatively, maybe adding another object. Let's try putting object 0 on the machine. If the machine turns on, that might indicate that object 0 is a blicket. But since object 1 was on the machine and it didn't activate, maybe the combination of 0 and 1 is needed. Or maybe object 1 is not a blicket, and object 0 is. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's state depends on the presence of all blickets. For example, if the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it, and if object 0 is a blicket, then adding it would make the machine turn on. But since the current setup (only object 1) is off, maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. \n\nAnother possibility is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. But since object 1 is on the machine and it's off, that would mean object 1 is not a blicket. So maybe object 0 or 2 is. Let's test that. \n\nFirst, let me take object 1 off the machine. That way, I can test each object individually. \n\nSo the command would be: take 1 off the machine. Then, check the machine's state. If after removing it, the light remains off, which it already is, but that doesn't tell me much. Then, I can try putting object 0 on the machine. If the machine turns on, that suggests object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe object 2. Then, try object 2. \n\nWait, but I have limited steps. Let me plan efficiently. \n\nCurrent state: machine has object 1, light off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Let me remove it first. \n\nSo, first action: take 1 off the machine. Then, the machine is empty. Then, put object 0 on. If light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, try 2. If neither, then maybe the rule requires more than one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. Suppose there are two blickets. If I put both on, the machine turns on. Let's see. But starting with 0 and 2 on the floor, perhaps. \n\nBut first, let's test individual objects. \n\nSo, first step: take 1 off. Then, put 0 on. Check light. Then take 0 off, put 1 on. Check, then put 2 on. \n\nBut maybe I can do that step by step. \n\nBut given the initial state, maybe removing 1 is the first move. So the command would be 'take 1 off machine'. Then, after that, the machine is empty, so the light would still be off. Then, I can try putting each object on one by one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the sum of the blicktness is above a threshold, or it's an AND or OR rule. \n\nBut let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, remove object 1 from the machine. So that's step 1: take 1 off. Then, check the machine's state. The light is still off. Then, put object 0 on. If the light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 2. \n\nSo, first command: take 1 off the machine."}

So far, I've tried putting object 0 and 2 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Initially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. Then I took object 1 off, and the light remained off. Then I put object 0 on, still off. Then added object 2, still off. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on when certain combinations are present. Maybe all blickets need to be on the machine? But there are 3 objects. Or maybe at least one blicket is needed, but maybe not all. Let's think. Since putting 0 and 2 didn't work, maybe they aren't blickets. But maybe 1 is a blicket, but when it was on the machine initially, the light was off. That doesn't make sense. Unless the rule is different, like the machine turns on only when exactly one blicket is on, but multiple might cancel it. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if an odd number of blickets are present. Or maybe it's based on weight or some other property.\n\nWait, maybe I should test each object individually. Let's start by testing each one alone. So far, object 1 was on the machine alone at the start, and the light was off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Then I put object 0 alone, light off. Then object 2 alone, light off. So none of them alone activate the machine. So maybe the rule requires more than one blicket. But how? Let's try combining them.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. If there are two blickets, then putting both on would activate it. Let's try putting 0 and 1 together. Or 1 and 2. Wait, right now, 0 and 2 are on the machine, but light is off. So if 0 and 2 are on, and light is off, then maybe they aren't both blickets. Or maybe the rule is different. Let's try putting objects 0 and 1 on the machine. Let me take off 0 and 2 first.\n\nWait, current state is objects 0 and 2 on the machine. Let's take them off and try other combinations. Maybe the blicket is object 1, but only when combined with another. But when object 1 was alone, it didn't work. Let me try putting object 1 back on the machine. Then maybe add another object.\n\nSo first, take object 0 and 2 off. Then put 1 on. Then add 0. Then check the light. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nBut each step counts. Let's plan:\n\nTake object 0 off the machine. Take object 2 off. Then put 1 on. Then put 0 on. Then check if the light turns on. If it does, then maybe 1 and 0 are blickets. But if not, then maybe another combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine only activates when a specific object is present, regardless of others. For example, maybe object 2 is a blicket, but only when it's the only one on. But when I put 2 on alone, the light was off. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on if at least one blicket is present, but the initial state had object 1 on the machine and the light was off. So that would mean object 1 is not a blicket. Then maybe objects 0 or 2 are blickets, but when they are on alone, it's not enough. Maybe the rule requires exactly two blickets. Let's try putting 0 and 1 together. But first, need to get 1 on the machine again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is based on the order in which objects are placed. But that seems complicated. Another possibility: the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is even or odd. Let's suppose there are two blickets. Putting both would make it even, but maybe that's the condition. Or maybe the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when all blickets are on the machine, and there are three blickets. But in that case, putting all three on should activate it. Let's try that. But initially, when objects 0 and 2 were on, adding 1 would make all three. Wait, but initially, object 1 was on, and light was off. Then taking 1 off and putting 0 and 2 on didn't help. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly one blicket is on. So if object 1 is a blicket, then when it's on alone, the machine should activate. But initially, object 1 was on, and the light was off. So that can't be. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on when the number of blickets on it is a multiple of some number. Or maybe it's a logical AND or OR. For example, if all blickets are on, then activate (AND), or if any blicket is on (OR). But given that when object 1 was alone, the light was off, and 0 and 2 were added and still off, maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly two blickets are on. If there are two blickets among the three, then putting those two would activate it. Let's try combinations. For example, if 0 and 1 are blickets, put them on together. If the light turns on, then they are the blickets. Similarly for other pairs.\n\nSo the possible pairs are 0+1, 0+2, 1+2. Let's test each pair.\n\nFirst, let's test 0 and 1. Current state: objects 0 and 2 are on the machine. So I need to take 2 off and put 1 on.\n\nCommand: take object 2 off the machine. Then put object 1 on the machine. Then check the light.\n\nIf the light turns on, then 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, try another pair.\n\nBut since steps are limited, I need to plan efficiently. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the total number of objects on it is even. But that's unlikely, since with 2 objects (0 and 2) it's even but didn't activate.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that a specific combination of objects (like XOR). For example, either object 0 or 1, but not both. But need to test.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that a blicket must be placed on the machine after another specific object. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the light turns on when all blickets are off the machine. But that seems counterintuitive.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state was object 1 on the machine, light off. Then when I took object 1 off, light still off. Then put 0 on, light off. Then put 2 on, light off. So none of these combinations worked. So perhaps the blicket is object 1, but the rule is that the machine turns on when it's NOT on the machine. So when object 1 is on the machine, light off; when it's off, light on. But when I took object 1 off, the light stayed off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present AND another condition. For example, maybe two blickets are needed, or a specific combination.\n\nWait, maybe the blickets are objects 0 and 2. But when both are on the machine, the light is off. So that can't be. Unless the rule is different. Maybe the machine turns on when a blicket is the only object on it. For example, if object 0 is a blicket, putting it alone would activate. But when I put object 0 on alone, the light was off. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Maybe I need to try more combinations. Let's try putting all three objects on the machine. If the light turns on, then perhaps all are blickets. But the initial state had object 1 on the machine, and the light was off, so adding 0 and 2 might make it turn on. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent state: objects 0 and 2 are on the machine. So I need to put object 1 on as well.\n\nCommand: put object 1 on the machine. Then check the light. If it turns on, maybe all three are blickets. But that seems unlikely. Let's try.\n\nBut first, let me check if that's possible. If all three are blickets and the rule is that all must be on the machine, then putting all three would activate. But initial state had only object 1 on, light off, so that can't be. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but in the initial state, object 1 was on (if it were a blicket), the light would be on. But it wasn't. So object 1 is not a blicket. Then the blickets must be among 0 and 2. But when both are on, the light is off. So maybe neither are blickets. That can't be, as the problem states there are some blickets.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when exactly one blicket is on, but the blicket is object 0. Wait, when I put object 0 on alone, light was off. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is placed on it, but only if another blicket is already there. Like, the machine needs at least two blickets. So if 0 and 2 are blickets, putting both would activate. But when I put 0 and 2, the light was off. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when the sum of some property (like weight) reaches a threshold. But we don't have info on weights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if the number of blickets on it is greater than or equal to 1. But then, if any blicket is on, it should activate. But in that case, when object 0 was on alone, it would activate if it's a blicket. But it didn't. So maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Similarly for 1 and 2.\n\nWait, this is a problem. If none of the objects are blickets, then the answer would be that there are no blickets, but the problem states that some are. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is more complex. For example, the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on, but not all three. Or maybe it's an XOR of two blickets.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's consider that the initial state had object 1 on the machine, and the light was off. Then, after removing 1 and putting 0 and 2 on, the light remains off. So perhaps none of these are blickets. But that can't be, so maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are off. But that's the opposite of what's expected. Alternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a specific combination of objects is present, not necessarily all blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blicket is object 1, but the machine only turns on when object 1 is off. But then when I took it off, the light stayed off.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to test more combinations. Let's try putting object 1 and 0 on the machine. So:\n\nTake object 2 off, take object 0 off (if needed). Then put 0 and 1 on.\n\nWait, current state: 0 and 2 are on the machine. So first, take 2 off, then put 1 on.\n\nSo:\n\n> take object 2 off the machine\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nThen check the light. If the light turns on, then maybe 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, try other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a single blicket is on, but only if it's object 1. But initial state had object 1 on and light off, so that can't be.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the light turns on when the number of blickets on it is odd. For example, if there are two blickets, then putting one on (odd) turns it on. But when I put 0 on, light off. If 0 is a blicket, then that would have made it odd (1 blicket), but light didn't turn on. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the light is on if the number of blickets on it is even. So if there are two blickets on, it turns on. But when 0 and 2 are on, light is off. So that would mean that 0 and 2 are not both blickets.\n\nWait, perhaps the blicket is object 1. But when it's on the machine alone, light is off. Maybe the rule requires object 1 to be off. So when object 1 is off the machine, the light turns on. But when I took it off, light remained off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But when objects 0 and 2 were on, light was off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a specific object is on, but only when another is also on. Like, object 0 and 1 together. Or maybe object 1 and 2. Let's test that.\n\nCurrent state: objects 0 and 2 are on the machine. Let's take object 2 off, then put 1 on. So:\n\n> take object 2 off the machine\n\nNow, machine has 0 on. Then:\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nNow machine has 0 and 1. Check light. If on, then maybe 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, try another pair.\n\nIf the light is still off, then maybe the pair 1 and 2. So take 0 off, put 2 on. Then machine has 1 and 2. Check light.\n\nAlternatively, after putting 0 and 1 on, if light is still off, then maybe the blickets are 1 and 2. Let's try that.\n\nBut I need to go step by step. Let's proceed with the first step: taking 2 off and adding 1.\n\nSo, the next command would be to take object 2 off the machine. Then put object 1 on the machine. Then look.\n\nBut since each step counts, I need to do each command one by one. Let's start with taking object 2 off."}

The initial setup had object 1 on the machine, but when I took it off, the machine stayed off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, but the light didn't turn on. Then I added object 2, making both 0 and 2 on the machine, but still no light. Then I took off object 2, leaving just 0 on, and the machine is still off. Hmm.\n\nSo, the machine didn't activate with just object 0 or 2 individually. Maybe the rule isn't about a single blicket. What if it requires a combination? Let's test putting object 1 on the machine again. Initially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. But maybe when combined with another object? Wait, in the first step, I tried taking 1 off and the machine stayed off. Then when I put 0 and 2 on, nothing happened. Maybe the blicket is object 1, but it's only active when placed alone? Wait, no. When object 1 was on the machine initially, the light was off. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on it. Let's see: we tried 0 and 2 together, but that didn't work. Maybe neither 0 nor 2 are blickets. So perhaps the blicket is object 1. Let's try putting object 1 back on the machine alone. If that turns it on, then maybe 1 is a blicket. But initially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. Unless there's a different condition, like the machine activates when a blicket is placed after others? Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is placed on it, but only if it's the only one. Wait, that doesn't fit with the initial state. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. If there are two blickets, then both need to be present. Let's see. Suppose objects 0 and 1 are blickets. If I put both on the machine, maybe the light turns on. But I need to test combinations.\n\nWait, let's list out the current state. Object 0 is on the machine, objects 1 and 2 are on the floor. The machine is off. If I put object 1 on the machine, then objects 0 and 1 are on it. If the machine turns on, that could mean that at least one of them is a blicket, but maybe both. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But then in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine and the light was off, which would mean object 1 isn't a blicket. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. If there's only one blicket, then putting it on the machine would activate it. But in the initial setup, object 1 was on the machine and the light was off, so maybe object 1 isn't a blicket, but there's another. Let's think. If object 0 is a blicket, but when I put it alone on the machine, the light didn't turn on. So maybe the rule isn't just having one blicket. Maybe it's a certain number of blickets. For example, two or more. But when I had 0 and 2 on the machine, nothing. So maybe 0 and 2 are not blickets. Then perhaps the blicket is 1, but the machine only activates when it's placed with another non-blicket? That seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on it. Then, if I put object 1 on the machine alone, and it turns on, that would indicate it's a blicket. But initially, it was on the machine and the light was off, which contradicts that. So maybe the initial state had object 1 on the machine, but the light was off, which suggests that object 1 isn't a blicket. So perhaps the blickets are 0 and 2. But when both were on the machine, the light didn't turn on. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but only if it's the only one on the machine. But when 0 was alone, nothing happened. Hmm. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's an odd number of blickets on it. Or perhaps the rule is more complex, like a specific combination. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine again, maybe with another object. For example, put 1 and 0 on the machine. Let's try that. First, remove object 0 from the machine, then put 1 on. Then see if the light turns on. Or put 1 and 0 together. Let's see. Current state: 0 is on the machine, 1 and 2 are on the floor. So I need to take 0 off, then put 1 on. Then check. If the light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, maybe try combinations. But let's proceed step by step. First, take object 0 off the machine. Then put object 1 on. Let's do that."}

So I need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule makes the machine turn on. The machine's light is off right now. Let's recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. Then I took object 1 off, and the light stayed off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, light still off. Then put object 2 on, still off. Then both 0 and 2 were on the machine, light off. Then I took them both off, still off. So none of those combinations turned the machine on.\n\nWait, maybe the initial setup had object 1 on the machine, and the light was off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket? Or maybe the rule isn't just having any blicket on. Maybe it's a specific combination. Let's think.\n\nThe blicketness is about mutual information between the object's state and the machine's state. So a blicket's presence affects the machine's state. So perhaps the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it, but maybe not. Or maybe it's when all blickets are on, or some other rule.\n\nBut in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. So if object 1 were a blicket, but the machine didn't turn on, that would mean that just having a blicket on isn't enough. Maybe the rule requires more than one? Or maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Let's test that again.\n\nWait, when I took object 1 off the machine, the light stayed off. So maybe having object 1 on the machine wasn't making it turn on. But then, when I put object 0 on, nothing. Then object 2 on, still nothing. So maybe none of those are blickets. But that can't be right because the problem says some are blickets. So perhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe the machine turns on only when all blickets are on it. If there are two blickets, then putting both on would turn it on. Or maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket to be on. Let's test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are present. But since there are three objects, maybe two are blickets, and putting both on would turn it on. Let me try putting objects 0 and 1 on. Wait, initially, object 1 was on the machine, and light was off. So if object 1 is a blicket, then maybe adding another blicket would make it turn on. Let's try combinations.\n\nLet's start by putting object 1 back on the machine. Previously, when object 1 was on, light was off. Then, maybe adding another object. Let's try putting object 1 and 0 on. Or maybe 1 and 2. Let's try that.\n\nWait, the current state: all objects are off the machine. Let's try putting object 1 on. If that's a blicket, maybe alone it's not enough. Then add another. Let's see.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then maybe 1 is a blicket. But previously, when 1 was on, the light was off. Hmm. Wait, maybe there's a different rule. Like the machine turns on only when a specific combination is present, regardless of individual blickets. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are on. Let's test that.\n\nSo let's try putting object 0 and 1 on. Then 0 and 2, then 1 and 2, then all three. If any of those combinations turn the machine on, then we can narrow down the blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket to be on. If putting object 0 on alone didn't work, then 0 isn't. If putting 1 on alone didn't work, then maybe 1 isn't. But if putting 2 on alone works, then 2 is a blicket.\n\nWait, earlier when I put object 0 and 2 on the machine, the light stayed off. So if the rule is that at least one blicket is needed, then neither 0 nor 2 are blickets. But that would leave only object 1. But when object 1 was on the machine initially, the light was off. So that can't be. So maybe the rule is different. Maybe the machine only turns on when all blickets are on. Suppose there are two blickets. Then, if I put both on, the machine turns on. Let's try combinations.\n\nLet's try putting object 1 and 0 on. If that turns it on, then maybe those two are blickets. But earlier, when 0 was on alone, it didn't work. So if 0 is a blicket, maybe it's only when combined with another. Let's try that.\n\nSo step by step. Let's start fresh. All objects are off the machine now. Let's put object 1 on first. Then check. Then add others.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, maybe not. But previously, when 1 was on, the light was off. So maybe 1 isn't a blicket. Let's try putting 0 and 1 together. Wait, but how to do that. Let's first put 0 on, then 1.\n\nBut when I put 0 on earlier, the light stayed off. Then adding 1. Let's see:\n\nPut object 0 on the machine: light off. Then put object 1 on the machine. If the light turns on, then maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, then maybe not. Let's try that.\n\nBut I need to do it step by step. So first:\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nThen check the light (look). Then put object 1 on the machine. Then check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state updates immediately when objects are added or removed. So maybe after each 'put' command, the light's state is observed. But in previous steps, when I put objects 0 and 2 on, the light was still off. So maybe the combination of 0 and 2 isn't sufficient. Let's try other combinations.\n\nAnother approach: try each object alone. If putting an object on the machine turns the light on, then it's a blicket. But in previous steps, none of the objects alone did that. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when a certain number of blickets are present, like exactly two. So I need to find two objects that, when both are on, the machine lights up.\n\nLet me try putting 0 and 1 on the machine. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, take any objects off. Then put 0 on. Light off. Then put 1 on. Check if light is on.\n\nBut in the initial setup, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. So if 1 is a blicket, but alone it's not enough. Maybe combining with another blicket. Let's try putting 1 and 2 on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0 and 2 together. Wait, previously, when 0 and 2 were on, light was off. So that combination isn't working. So maybe 1 and 0, or 1 and 2.\n\nLet's try putting 1 and 0 on. So:\n\nTake all objects off (they already are off). Put 0 on. Light off. Then put 1 on. Check. If light turns on, then 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, try 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on. Suppose there are two blickets. If I put both on, then the machine turns on. So let's test pairs.\n\nLet's start with objects 1 and 2. Put 1 on, then 2. If light turns on, then those are blickets. If not, try another pair.\n\nBut first, need to put them on. Let's proceed.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are on the floor.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nIf the light is still off, then proceed to add object 2.\n\nBut when I put object 1 on earlier (initially), light was off. So let's add 2 now.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nCheck if light is on. If yes, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then maybe 0 and 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all three are needed. Let's try that.\n\nBut earlier, when 0 and 2 were on, light was off. So adding 1 might make it on. Let's see.\n\nBut this is getting a bit time-consuming. Let's think of possible rules. Maybe the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is on. If so, then none of the objects when placed alone worked, so maybe none are blickets? But that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when no blickets are on. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on if any blicket is off the machine. But that seems less likely. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's state depends on the presence of a blicket in a certain position. For example, maybe the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on the machine. If that's the case, then the fact that putting any single object on the machine didn't turn it on suggests that none of them are blickets. But the problem states that some are. So perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the machine turns on only if all blickets are on the machine. So if there are two blickets, both need to be on. Let's test that.\n\nSuppose objects 0 and 1 are blickets. Then putting both on should turn the machine on. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are on the floor.\n\nPut 0 on: light off. Then put 1 on: check if light turns on. If yes, then both are blickets. If not, try other pairs.\n\nBut when I did that earlier, when 0 was on and then 1 was added, maybe the light didn't turn on. Wait, no, in previous steps, after taking object 1 off the machine, I put 0 on, then 2 on, but the light stayed off. Then I removed both, and then the current state is all objects off. So let's try putting 0 and 1 on.\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nLight is off. Then:\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nCheck if light is on. If yes, then 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, try 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0 and 2 are blickets. But when I put them both on before, the light stayed off.\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when exactly one blicket is on. So if two blickets are on, it doesn't turn on. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are on. For example, if there are two blickets, putting one on would turn it on, putting both would turn it off. But that might require more testing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires a specific combination, like object 1 and 2 together. Let's try putting 1 and 2 on.\n\nCurrent state: all objects off. So:\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight stays off. Then:\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nIf light turns on, then those two are blickets, and the rule is that both need to be present. Otherwise, try other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is activated by a single blicket, but that blicket is object 2. Let's try putting object 2 on alone.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then not.\n\nBut earlier when I put object 2 on the machine along with 0, the light stayed off. But if 2 is a blicket, then even alone it should activate the machine. So if putting 2 alone doesn't work, then maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, but maybe the machine's activation depends on the absence of a blicket. Like, if a blicket is off the machine, it turns on. So if a blicket is on the machine, it stays off. That would be a different rule. Let's consider that.\n\nFor example, suppose object 1 is a blicket. If it's on the machine, the light is off. If it's off, the light is on. But in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. When I took it off, the light stayed off. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that all non-blickets are on the machine. That seems unlikely. Or maybe the presence of a blicket on the floor activates the machine. So if a blicket is on the floor, the machine turns on. So when a blicket is removed from the machine (put on the floor), the machine activates. Let's test that.\n\nIn the initial state, object 1 was on the machine. The light was off. Then when I took it off (put on floor), the light stayed off. So if object 1 were a blicket, then putting it on the floor should activate the machine, but that didn't happen. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to systematically test each object alone and in combinations.\n\nLet's try each object alone:\n\n- Put object 0 on: light off.\n- Put object 1 on: light off.\n- Put object 2 on: light off.\n\nSo none activate the machine alone. Then try pairs:\n\n- 0 and 1: light off.\n- 0 and 2: light off.\n- 1 and 2: ?\n\nHaven't tried 1 and 2 together yet. Let's do that.\n\nCurrent state: all objects off.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nCheck light. If it turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, maybe all three are needed.\n\nIf even with all three on, light is off, then perhaps the rule is different, like requiring a specific configuration not based on presence/absence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is removed. Let's think.\n\nIn initial state, object 1 was on the machine. Light off. Then I took it off, light remained off. So that doesn't support that.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's activation depends on the number of objects on it, regardless of being blickets. But the problem states that blickets have mutual information, so the rule must relate to the blickets.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. So if there are two blickets, putting both on activates it. Let's test pairs.\n\nLet's try putting 1 and 2 on.\n\nAfter putting 1 on and then 2, check light. If on, then they are blickets. If not, try other pairs.\n\nBut in previous steps, when I put 0 and 2 on, light was off. So 0 and 2 are not both blickets. Let's try 1 and 2.\n\nSo:\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nIf light is on, then 1 and 2 are blickets, rule is both must be present. If not, then maybe all three.\n\nBut earlier, when all three were on, maybe the light was off. Wait, no, I haven't tried all three yet. Let's try that.\n\nAfter putting 1 and 2 on, light is off. Then add object 0.\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nCheck if light turns on. If yes, then all three are blickets. If not, then the rule must be something else.\n\nBut this is using many steps. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are off.\n\n1. Put object 1 on. Light off.\n2. Put object 2 on. Light off.\n3. Put object 0 on. Light still off.\n\nIf all three are on, light is off, then the rule isn't about the number of blickets on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a specific single blicket is on, but we haven't found it yet. But when we put each alone, light was off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is based on the order in which objects are placed. For example, the last object placed is a blicket. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when a blicket is added after another object. For instance, adding a blicket followed by a non-blicket. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on when all non-blickets are on it. So if some objects are non-blickets, putting all of them on would activate the machine. But that depends on the number of non-blickets. If there are two non-blickets, putting both on would activate. But I need to know which are non-blickets, which is the opposite of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, the machine turns on when no blickets are on it. So if all blickets are off, the machine activates. But in the initial state, object 1 was on (a possible blicket), and the light was off. If the machine turns on when no blickets are on, then taking object 1 off should turn it on. But when I took object 1 off, the light stayed off. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's think of other possible rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on, and the others are off. Or maybe a certain combination of blickets and non-blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's activation is based on the sum of some property of the blickets. For example, the total weight or some other attribute. But since we can't see that, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be temporal. Like, the machine turns on after a certain sequence of actions. But the problem states that the machine's state is based on the current configuration, not past actions.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\". So, the presence of a blicket affects the probability of the machine being on. So, if an object is a blicket, then whether it's on the machine or not changes the probability of the machine being on. But in the observations so far, the machine has always been off. So perhaps the rule requires the absence of a blicket. Or maybe the machine is on only when a certain condition involving blickets is met.\n\nWait, but in all the configurations we've tried, the machine's light has remained off. That's odd. Unless we haven't tried the correct combination yet.\n\nWait, maybe the machine was on initially, but no. The first description said the light was off when object 1 was on the machine. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are off. Let's see.\n\nIf object 1 is a blicket, then when it's on the machine, the light is off. When it's off, the light turns on. But when we took object 1 off initially, the light stayed off. So that can't be. Unless there's another blicket.\n\nAlternatively, if there are two blickets, and the machine turns on when both are off. But that would require that when both are off, the light is on. But when we have all objects off, the light is off. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on. Suppose there are two blickets. If I put one on, the machine turns on. But in previous steps, putting any single object on didn't work. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, then putting either alone should turn it on. But they didn't. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is an XOR-type: it turns on when an odd number of blickets are on. If there are two blickets, then putting one on would activate it, putting both would deactivate. But when we put 0 and 2 on earlier, the light was off. So if 0 and 2 are blickets, putting two (even) would turn it off. But when they were both on, it was off. But when they were off, it was off too. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when a specific single blicket is on. But when we put each on alone, it didn't work. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on when a certain blicket is on, but only if another is off. For example, if object 1 is a blicket and must be on, and object 0 is a non-blicket and must be off. But how to test that.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires that all blickets are on and some non-blickets are off. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I might need to try putting all three objects on the machine to see if that changes anything.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are off.\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nCheck if light turns on. If yes, then maybe all three are blickets, and the rule requires all to be on. If not, then the rule is something else.\n\nBut earlier, when I had 0 and 2 on, light was off. Adding 1 might make it on. Let's see.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's proceed.\n\nAfter putting all three on, if light is still off, then perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the machine is always off, but that's impossible because the problem states some are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's light was on in some previous step but I missed it. Let me check the history.\n\nInitial setup: object 1 on machine, light off.\n\nThen took 1 off: light still off.\n\nPut 0 on: light off.\n\nPut 2 on: light off.\n\nTook 2 and 0 off: light off.\n\nSo in none of these steps did the light turn on. So either I haven't tried the right combination yet, or the rule is such that the machine is off in all cases except when certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on only when all blickets are off. Suppose there are two blickets. If both are off, light is on. But when all objects are off, light is off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the machine turns on when a blicket is on and another condition is met, like another blicket is off. For example, if object 1 is a blicket and must be on, and object 2 is a blicket and must be off. Then the machine turns on when 1 is on and 2 is off. But how to test that.\n\nLet's try putting 1 on and keeping 2 off. So object 1 on, others off. Light off. Then take 1 off and put 2 on. Light off. Then put 1 on and 2 off. Light off. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly two blickets are on. Suppose objects 0 and 1 are blickets. Putting both on should activate it. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent state: all objects off.\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nIf light turns on, then rule is at least two blickets. Otherwise, no.\n\nBut in previous steps, when 0 and 2 were on, light was off. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, this would activate the machine. Let's see.\n\nAssuming this is the next step:\n\nAfter putting 0 and 1 on, check the light. If it turns on, then those are the blickets. If not, then perhaps 1 and 2.\n\nBut given the step limit, I need to proceed.\n\nSo, the next command should be to put object 1 on the machine again, then check. But I need to output one command at a time.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are off.\n\nSo, let's try putting object 1 and 2 on the machine. Let's do:\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\nThen put object 2 on the machine.\n\nIf light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then maybe all three are blickets and need to all be on. But when all three were on earlier, light was off. Wait, no, I haven't tried all three yet. Let's try that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a blicket is placed on the machine after another object. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when all objects except one blicket are on. Not sure.\n\nGiven that all previous combinations didn't work, perhaps the rule requires that a certain object is not on the machine. For example, the machine turns on when object 1 is off. But in initial state, object 1 was on, and light was off. When taken off, light stayed off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I might need to think outside the box. Perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly one object is on the machine, and that object is a blicket. But when I tested each object alone, none worked. So perhaps none are blickets, but the problem states some are. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when two objects are on the machine, and one of them is a blicket. So even if only one blicket is present among two objects. But then, when I put 0 and 1 on, if either is a blicket, the machine would turn on. But when I put 0 and 1 on earlier, light was off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when the total number of objects on it is even (or odd). But that's not related to blickets, which contradicts the problem's definition.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I missed a step where the light was on. Let me review all previous steps:\n\n- Initial: 1 on machine, light off.\n\n- Took 1 off: light off.\n\n- Put 0 on: light off.\n\n- Put 2 on: light off.\n\n- Took 2 and 0 off: light off.\n\nSo far, all steps resulted in light off. So perhaps the correct combination hasn't been tried yet. Let's try putting 1 and 2 on again.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are off.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nCheck light. If still off, then try adding 0.\n\nBut that would use more steps. Let me proceed.\n\nIf after adding 1 and 2, light remains off, then put 0 on. But when all three are on, light still off. Then perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when no objects are on. But when all are off, light is off. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is based on the order of placement. For example, placing a blicket first and then a non-blicket. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly two blickets are on, regardless of others. Suppose there are two blickets among the three. Let's say 0 and 1. Then putting both on should activate the machine. But when I put 0 and 1 on, light is off. So that's not it. Then maybe 1 and 2.\n\nBut when I put 1 and 2 on, light is off. Then maybe 0 and 2. Which also didn't work. So that leaves all three being blickets, but when all are on, light is off. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when at least one blicket is not on the machine. So if a blicket is removed, the machine turns on. For example, if object 1 is a blicket, then when it's off the machine, the light turns on. But initially, when object 1 was on, light was off. When I took it off, light stayed off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on the machine and at least one other blicket is off. But this requires at least two blickets. For example, if 0 and 1 are blickets. Putting 0 on and 1 off: machine on. Putting both on: machine off. But when I put 0 on and 1 off, the light was off. So that's not it.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let's hypothesize that the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on, and there are two blickets. So putting one of them on would activate it. But when I tried each alone, it didn't work. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a blicket is placed on the machine after another blicket. Like a sequence. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that the light turns on when the number of blickets on the machine is a multiple of a certain number, like two. But that's unclear.\n\nGiven that I've tried various combinations and the light remains off, perhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe the machine turns on when a specific single blicket is off. For example, if object 1 is a blicket and the machine turns on when it's off. But when I took it off initially, the light stayed off. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly one blicket is on, but that blicket is object 2. But when I put object 2 on alone, light was off. So that's not possible.\n\nAt this point, I might need to reconsider the initial steps. Maybe there's a mistake in my earlier assumptions. For example, when I took object 1 off initially, the light remained off. But what if object 1 is a blicket and the machine's rule is that it turns on when it's absent? But in that case, removing it should turn the light on, which didn't happen. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when at least one blicket is on and at least one non-blicket is on. So a combination. Suppose object 1 is a blicket, and objects 0 and 2 are non-blickets. Then putting 1 and 0 on would turn it on. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent state: all objects off.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nCheck if light turns on. If yes, then rule is a blicket and a non-blicket. If not, then no.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's proceed.\n\nIf after putting 1 and 0 on, light turns on, then 1 is a blicket, and 0 is a non-blicket. But when I put 0 on alone, light was off, and with 1, it turns on. That would fit the rule: the machine needs at least one blicket and at least one non-blicket. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine needs a specific pair of blicket and non-blicket. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try this combination.\n\nSo, the next command is to put object 1 on the machine, then object 0. But I can only output one command at a time.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are off.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then the rule is that both 1 and 0 must be on. But earlier, when 0 and 2 were on, light was off. So if this combination works, then 1 is a blicket and 0 is a non-blicket. But that doesn't make sense because mutual information requires that the object's state affects the machine's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket and a non-blicket are both on. If 1 is a blicket and 0 is a non-blicket, then putting both on would activate it. Let's see.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Given the remaining steps, I need to try different combinations.\n\nAnother approach: since the problem states that some objects are blickets, and none of the single or paired combinations have worked, maybe the machine turns on when all blickets are off. Suppose there's one blicket. When it's off, the machine turns on. But when I took it off, the light stayed off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on, but there are three blickets, and putting one on isn't enough. But that contradicts the mutual information definition.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should try a different combination that I haven't tried yet. Like putting object 1 and 2 on the machine again.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are off.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nLight off.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n\nIf the light turns on now, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, try adding object 0.\n\nBut given the step limit, I'll proceed with the next command."}

The initial setup was objects 0 and 2 on the floor, and object 1 on the machine. The machine was off. Then, when I took object 1 off, the machine stayed off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, still off. Then added object 2, machine remained off. Then removed both 0 and 2, machine off. Then put object 1 back on, still off.\n\nHmm, so putting individual objects on the machine didn't turn it on. Maybe the rule requires a combination. Let's try putting two objects together. Since putting 0 and 2 together didn't work, maybe 0 and 1, or 1 and 2? Let's test that.\n\nWait, when objects 0 and 2 were both on the machine, maybe that's not the right combo. Let me try putting object 1 with another. Since when object 1 was initially on the machine alone, the light was off. Maybe it needs another. Let's try putting object 1 and 0 on together.\n\nFirst, make sure machine is empty. Take off object 1. Then put 0 on, then 1. Let's see.\n\nWait, currently, object 1 is on the machine. Let me take it off first. Then put object 0 on, then object 1. If the machine turns on with both 0 and 1, maybe they are blickets. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. So maybe need to find which two are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that all blickets must be on the machine. If there are two blickets, then putting both on would activate. Let's test combinations.\n\nWait, initial state had object 1 on the machine, and the machine was off. So if object 1 is a blicket, maybe it's not sufficient alone. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present, or when a certain combination. Let's try combinations.\n\nSo possible scenarios:\n\nTest 0 and 1 together. Put 0 and 1 on the machine. If machine turns on, maybe they are both blickets. If not, then maybe another pair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all three are needed. Let's check.\n\nBut since the machine didn't turn on when all three were on the machine (since initially 1 was on, then adding 0 and 2 didn't activate it, but wait, when were all three on? Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine. Then I took it off. Then put 0 on, then 2 on. So machine had 0 and 2. Machine was off. Then I took them off. Then put 1 back on. So in none of these steps were three objects on the machine. Maybe try putting all three on now.\n\nBut first, let's try combinations of two. Let's start by putting 0 and 1 on. Let me do that.\n\nFirst, take object 1 off (since it's currently on the machine). Then put 0 on, then 1. Let's see.\n\nWait, current state after last command: object 1 is on the machine, others are on the floor. So to test 0 and 1 together, I need to put 0 on the machine while 1 is there. Let's do that.\n\nSo command: put object 0 on the machine. If the machine light turns on, that would suggest that 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, maybe another pair."}

So, the goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. Blickets are objects that have a non-independent relationship with the machine's state. So, their presence on the machine affects whether the machine lights up, based on some hidden rule.\n\nSo far, the user has tried several combinations. Let's recap the actions and outcomes:\n\n1. Initially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. When they took it off, light stayed off.\n2. Then they put object 0 on, machine stayed off.\n3. Then added object 2, still off. Then removed both 0 and 2, put 1 back on, still off. Then added 0 again, still off.\n\nHmm. So in all these cases, the machine hasn't turned on yet. That suggests maybe none of the individual objects are blickets, or perhaps the rule requires multiple blickets. Or maybe the rule is something else, like a specific combination or order.\n\nWait, but the initial state had object 1 on the machine, and the light was off. Taking it off didn't change anything. So putting 1 on the machine alone didn't work. Then putting 0 and 2 on together also didn't work. Then putting 1 again alone, nothing. Then 0 alone, nothing.\n\nSo maybe the rule isn't as simple as having any single blicket. Maybe it requires two or more blickets to be on the machine at the same time. Let's consider that possibility.\n\nBut we haven't seen the machine turn on yet. So perhaps the blickets are objects 0 and 2, but they need to be on together. Wait, in step when both 0 and 2 were on the machine, the light was still off. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe object 1 is a blicket but only in combination with another. But when 1 was on alone, it didn't work. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is different. Like, the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on it. But then if there's a blicket, putting it alone should work. But in initial state, object 1 was on the machine, and it was off. So that would mean 1 isn't a blicket. Then putting 0 on alone didn't work, 2 on alone didn't work either. So maybe none are blickets? But the problem states that some are. So perhaps the rule is more complex.\n\nWait, maybe the machine only turns on when a certain number of blickets are present. For example, if there's at least one, but maybe there's another condition. Or maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on it. Let's say there are two blickets, and both need to be on the machine. But when 0 and 2 were on, nothing happened. So maybe 0 and 2 aren't the blickets. Alternatively, maybe 1 and another. Let's try to test combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is odd, or even. Or maybe a specific number. But without seeing the machine turn on, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe the initial state had object 1 on the machine, and the light was off. Then taking it off didn't change. So perhaps object 1 isn't a blicket. Then putting 0 on alone didn't work. Putting 2 on alone didn't work. Then putting 0 and 2 together didn't work. So maybe the blicket is object 2, but only when combined with another? But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when a specific blicket is on, but only if another is not. Or maybe it's a XOR situation. But without seeing the light turn on, it's hard to deduce.\n\nWait, maybe the user hasn't tried all possible combinations yet. Let's think. So far:\n\n- 1 alone: off\n- 0 alone: off\n- 2 alone: off\n- 0 and 2 together: off\n- 1 and 0 (if that's possible? Let's check the steps. When 0 was on and 2 was added, then both 0 and 2 were on. Then they were taken off, and 1 was put on. Then 0 was added again. Wait, when 1 was on the machine, then 0 was added, so both 1 and 0 were on. But the light was still off. So even with 1 and 0 on together, it didn't turn on.\n\nSo that combination also didn't work. Hmm. So perhaps none of the objects are blickets? But the problem says some are. That can't be. So maybe the rule is different. Like, the machine turns on when all blickets are off the machine. But that seems counterintuitive. Or maybe when a certain weight or arrangement is present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on only when a specific object is not on it. For example, if a blicket is on the floor. Let's see: when 1 was on the machine initially, light off. When taken off, light off. When 0 was on, light off. When 2 was added, still off. Then all off, then 1 on again, light off. Then 0 added, light off. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that exactly one blicket is on, but only if it's a certain one. But we tried each alone and none worked.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on, but only if another condition is met. For example, the machine's state depends on the presence of two blickets, but in a way that requires a specific pair. Let's say objects 1 and 2 are blickets, but both need to be on. When 1 was on the machine initially, and then 2 was added (step where 0 and 2 were on), but then maybe the user didn't have 1 and 2 on together. Wait, let's check the steps again.\n\nWait, initial setup: 1 was on the machine. Then user took 1 off, put 0 on, then put 2 on. So at that point, 0 and 2 were on the machine. Then user took both off, put 1 on, then added 0 again. So 1 and 0 were on. So in none of these cases were 1 and 2 on together. So maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 need to be on. Let's test that.\n\nSo the next step could be to put both 1 and 2 on the machine and see. Let's see the current state after the last action. The user just put object 0 on the machine again, so now object 0 is on the machine, and object 1 was on the machine but then 0 was added. Wait, let me check the last commands:\n\nAfter taking object 0 off, the user put object 1 on the machine. Then looked, then put object 0 on the machine again. So now, objects 0 and 1 are on the machine. The light is off. So that combination didn't work. Then the user tried putting 0 on again, but maybe it's already on. Wait, no: in the last step, after taking 0 off earlier, they put object 1 on, then added 0 again. So currently, 0 and 1 are on the machine. But the light is off. So that combination isn't working.\n\nSo perhaps the blickets are 1 and 2, but they need to be on together. Let's try that. The user needs to take 0 off, put 1 and 2 on.\n\nSo next command could be take object 0 off the machine, then put object 1 and 2 on. But each command is a single step.\n\nAlternatively, first take 0 off, then put 2 on, then put 1 on. Let's see.\n\nBut the user has limited steps, so need to be efficient. Let's think: the user hasn't tried putting 1 and 2 together yet.\n\nCurrent state after last command (put object 0 on machine): objects 0 and 1 are on the machine (wait, no: in the previous steps, after taking object 0 off, the user put object 1 on the machine. Then put object 0 on again. So now, objects 0 and 1 are on the machine. The light is off. So the next step could be to take 0 off, then put 2 on, and see if 1 and 2 together work.\n\nBut maybe I should first check the current state again. Let me look:\n\nAfter the last command, the user put object 0 on the machine. The previous state was object 1 on the machine (from when they put object 1 on), then adding object 0. So now, objects 0 and 1 are both on the machine, light is off. So the user needs to test other combinations.\n\nSo possible next steps:\n\nTake object 0 off, then put object 2 on. Then check if the light turns on when 1 and 2 are on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires three objects on. But there are only three objects, and initial state had one on, which didn't work. But maybe all three must be on. But when 0 and 2 were on, then adding 1 (but 1 was on the floor). Wait, the user hasn't tried all three on the machine yet.\n\nSo let's try that. Take 0 and 1 off (but currently, they are on), then put all three on. But that would take multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. But the user hasn't found which two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on, but none of the tested objects are blickets. But that's impossible because the problem states some are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine only turns on when a certain object is removed. But that's not typical.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the commands. Let me recheck the sequence of actions and outcomes:\n\n1. Start: objects 0 (floor), 1 (machine), 2 (floor). Light off.\n2. Took object 1 off. Now all on floor. Light off.\n3. Put 0 on machine. Now 0 on, others floor. Light off.\n4. Put 2 on machine. Now 0 and 2 on. Light off.\n5. Took 2 off, then 0 off. Now all floor. Light off.\n6. Put 1 on. Light off.\n7. Put 0 on. Light off.\n\nSo in none of these cases did the light turn on. So perhaps the blickets are 0 and 2, but only when both are on. But when they were on together, light was off. So that can't be. Or maybe the machine requires exactly three objects on? But there are three objects. Let's try putting all three on the machine.\n\nTo do that, need to put 1, 0, and 2 on. Currently, 0 and 1 are on. So the next step is to put 2 on. Then check if the light turns on. So the command would be \"put object 2 on the machine\". Let's see what happens.\n\nBut let's think: if putting all three on makes the light turn on, then the rule could be that all blickets must be on. If there are three blickets, but that's possible. But maybe the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine is even, or odd, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on only when a specific combination is present, like object 1 and 2 together, or something else.\n\nBut the user needs to test this. So next command: put object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the combination of 0,1,2 being on does it. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the light turns on when a certain object is present regardless of others. But previous tests didn't show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on. But none of the individual objects worked. So maybe none are blickets, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. The user hasn't seen the machine turn on yet. So perhaps the blickets are 0 and 2, but the machine only turns on when they're both on and another condition is met, like object 1 is off. Let's check:\n\nWhen 0 and 2 were on, object 1 was on the floor. The light was off. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, if 1 is on the machine with them. But that would be all three, which was tested (when 0 and 2 were on, then adding 1 would make all three). But that hasn't been tested yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a certain object is on, but only if another is not. For example, if object 1 is on, but object 0 is off. Or something like that.\n\nBut without any positive examples, it's hard to deduce. The user needs to try different combinations. Let's try putting all three on the machine. So next command: put object 2 on the machine. Then look. If that doesn't work, try removing one and see.\n\nBut given the steps, the user might be running out of steps. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the current state is objects 0 and 1 on the machine. The next step would be to put object 2 on. Let's do that."}

So far, here's what I've observed:\n\nInitially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. After taking it off, the light stayed off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, but the light was still off. Adding object 2 to the machine (so both 0 and 2 were on it) also didn't turn it on. Then I took both 0 and 2 off and put 1 back on, but the light was still off. Then I added 0 again (so 0 and 1 were on the machine), and the light stayed off. Finally, when I put 2 on along with 0, the light turned on. Wait, no\u2014when I put 2 on the machine again after taking them all off, the steps were:\n\nWait, let me check the exact sequence again. \n\nFirst, after taking all objects off, I put 1 on, then 0, then 2. But when I put 2 on, the light came on. Wait, in the last step, after taking 0 and 2 off, I put 1 on (light off), then added 0 (still off), then added 2, and then the light turned on. So the combination of objects 0, 1, and 2? No, wait, when I put object 2 on, the machine had 0 and 2 on it, because after taking 0 and 2 off earlier, I put 1 on, then added 0, then added 2. So at that point, objects 0, 1, and 2 are all on the machine? Wait no, let me check again:\n\nWait the last steps were:\n\n- Take object 2 off the machine (so machine has 0 and 2 off)\n- Take object 0 off (machine is empty)\n- Put object 1 on (machine has 1)\n- Light is off\n- Put object 0 on (machine has 1 and 0)\n- Light is off\n- Put object 2 on (machine now has 1, 0, 2)\n- Light turns on.\n\nWait, but in the output after that last command, it says \"You put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\"\n\nWait, but the machine's state after that would have objects 0, 1, and 2 all on it. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are on. But let's check previous steps.\n\nEarlier, when I had objects 0 and 2 on the machine (without 1), the light was off. Then, when I added 2 again (with 0 and 1 on the machine?), but maybe there's a different rule. Wait, maybe the machine turns on when at least two blickets are on it. Or perhaps it's a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 2 is a blicket, and when it's placed on the machine with any other, but earlier when 0 and 2 were on, the light was off. Wait, that doesn't add up. Let's list all the trials:\n\n1. Initial state: 1 on machine, others off. Light off. After taking 1 off, light stays off. Then putting 0 on machine (only 0), light off. Then adding 2 (0 and 2 on), light off. Then taking both off. Then putting 1 on (alone), light off. Adding 0 (1 and 0), light off. Adding 2 (1,0,2), light on.\n\nSo when all three are on, the light turns on. But that seems like the rule might be that all three are blickets and all must be on. But that's possible. However, earlier when 1 was on alone, the light was off. So if all three are required, then each is a blicket. But that's a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe only object 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least two blickets. But in that case, when 2 was on with 0 (assuming 0 is not a blicket), the light would stay off. But when 2 was added to 1 and 0, maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on it. Let's hypothesize that objects 1 and 2 are blickets. Then, when 1 was alone, light off. When 1 and 0 (assuming 0 is not), light off. When 1 and 2 are on, then light on. But in the last step, when 1, 0, and 2 are on, the light is on. So maybe the presence of 1 and 2 together triggers it. Let me check earlier steps.\n\nWait, when object 1 was on the machine initially, and then taken off, the light was off. Then when object 0 was added alone, light off. Then adding 2 (so 0 and 2 on machine), light off. Then taking both off. Then putting 1 on, then adding 0, then adding 2: light on. So in that case, when 1, 0, and 2 are all on, light is on. But if the rule is that all three are needed, then they are all blickets. But when 1 was on alone, it didn't trigger. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But that's not possible because when 1 was on alone, the light was off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are on it. But I need more data.\n\nWait, another possibility: the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. But in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine (light off), which would mean 1 is not a blicket. Then when we added 0 and 2, but light stayed off. Then when we put 1, 0, and 2, the light came on. If the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly three blickets are present, then all three are blickets. But that's a possible rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on the machine. If there are two blickets, say 1 and 2, then when both are on, the light turns on. Let's check:\n\nIn the initial state, 1 was on, light off. If 1 is a blicket but the machine requires another one, then adding 2 would turn it on. But when 0 and 2 were on, the light was off. So if 2 is a blicket, but 0 is not, then having 2 alone would not be enough. But when 1,0,2 are on, maybe the presence of 1 and 2 (both blickets) turns it on. But when 1 was on alone, it didn't. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on, the light turns on. But in the last step, 1,0,2 are on. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then the presence of both would trigger the light, which is what happened. So that could be the case.\n\nBut wait, when I had 1 and 0 on the machine (assuming 0 is not a blicket), the light was off. Then adding 2 (a blicket) to make 1,0,2 on the machine would mean two blickets (1 and 2), so the light turns on. That fits. Then in the earlier case where 0 and 2 were on, if 2 is a blicket but 0 is not, then only one blicket (2) is present, so the light stays off. Then when adding 1 (another blicket), the total becomes two, so the light turns on. So this suggests that the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are on it, and the blickets are 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine alone, and the light was off. If 1 is a blicket, then according to the rule of at least two, that wouldn't trigger. But if the rule is exactly two, then having 1 and 2 would trigger. So in that case, in the last step, when 1,0,2 are on, the machine has two blickets (1 and 2), so the light turns on. That fits. So the blickets would be 1 and 2. The rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are on it.\n\nBut wait, earlier when 0 and 2 were on the machine, the light was off. If 2 is a blicket, but 0 is not, then only one blicket (2) is present, so the light stays off. Then when adding 1 (another blicket) to make 0,1,2 on the machine, the light comes on because two blickets (1 and 2) are present. That makes sense.\n\nBut how can we confirm this? Let's think of other possible tests. For example, put 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, that supports the rule. If it doesn't, then maybe another rule.\n\nBut in the current steps, we haven't tried that. The user's last action was putting object 2 on the machine when 0 and 1 were already on it, resulting in the light turning on. So the machine has 0,1,2 on it. But if the rule is that having both 1 and 2 on the machine (regardless of 0), then that would explain the light turning on. So to test this, the next step could be to remove object 0 and see if the light stays on. If the light requires 1 and 2, then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) should keep the light on. If the light goes off, then the rule might require all three.\n\nBut since the user has limited steps, maybe we should try to verify. However, in the current scenario, after putting 2 on, the light is on. Let's check the current state: objects 0,1,2 are all on the machine. The light is on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are present. But earlier when 0 and 2 were on, the light was off, which would contradict that. Therefore, the rule can't be all three. So the alternative is that the presence of both 1 and 2 triggers it.\n\nBut how do we confirm that? Let's think. Suppose we remove object 0 now. If the light stays on, then the rule is that 1 and 2 are on. If the light goes off, then maybe the rule is that all three are needed.\n\nBut the user might not have enough steps. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any two blickets are present. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, then having either of them plus another (but that doesn't fit). Wait, no. The earlier case when 1 was alone didn't turn it on, but when 1 and 2 are present (with or without others), it does. So maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. So if both are present, regardless of others, the light turns on. That would fit. Because in the last step, adding 2 to 0 and 1 (so 1 and 2 are present) turns it on. If that's the case, then the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut earlier, when 1 was on the machine alone (initially), the light was off. When we added 2 to 0 (objects 0 and 2 on), the light was off. Then when 1,0,2 are on, the light is on. So the presence of 1 and 2 together triggers it. That suggests that the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. Therefore, they are the blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then when they are both on, the light turns on. But when they are on with others, it's still on.\n\nSo to test this, we can try putting 1 and 2 on the machine without any others. If the light turns on, that supports the rule. If not, then maybe another combination.\n\nBut in the current state, the machine has 0,1,2 on it. The light is on. So if we take 0 off, leaving 1 and 2, and the light remains on, that would confirm that the presence of 1 and 2 is sufficient. If the light goes off, then the rule requires all three.\n\nBut since the user is trying to minimize steps, perhaps the agent can do that. However, the agent's next step is to decide what to do. The current state is that objects 0,1,2 are on the machine, and the light is on. The next command could be to take 0 off and see if the light stays on.\n\nSo the next command would be 'take object 0 off the machine', and observe if the light remains on. But the agent hasn't done that yet. However, given the current information, perhaps the agent can infer based on the existing data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turned on when 2 was added, even though 0 and 1 were already on. So when 2 was placed, the light turned on. That suggests that the presence of 2 is the key. But earlier, when 0 and 2 were on, the light was off. So that's conflicting. So why did the light turn on when 2 was added to 0 and 1?\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine the steps:\n\nAfter taking all objects off (0,1,2 on floor), the agent puts 1 on (machine has 1, light off). Then adds 0 (machine has 1 and 0, light off). Then adds 2 (machine has 1,0,2, light on). So the addition of 2 caused the light to turn on. But when 0 and 2 were on earlier, the light was off. So what's the difference between these two scenarios?\n\nIn the first case, objects 0 and 2 were on (without 1), light off. In the second case, 1,0,2 are on, light on. So the presence of 1 along with 0 and 2 is causing the light to turn on. That suggests that 1 is a blicket, and the rule requires at least one blicket. But that doesn't fit because when 1 was alone, the light was off. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the sum of blicktness is a certain value. For example, if each blicket contributes 1, and the machine needs a total of 2. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on, sum is 2, light on. But when 1 is alone, sum is 1 (off). When 2 is alone, sum is 1 (off). When both are present, sum 2 (on). But in the last step, when 1,0,2 are on, sum is 2 (if 1 and 2 are blickets), so light on. That would fit. So the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. Then the blickets are 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires at least two blickets. So having 1 and 2 would trigger it, regardless of others.\n\nBut in the first case where 0 and 2 were on, if 2 is a blicket and 0 is not, then only one blicket (2) is present, so light stays off. Then adding 1 (another blicket) brings the total to two, so light turns on. That fits.\n\nSo based on the current information, the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are on it. Or exactly two.\n\nBut how to confirm. Let's think of possible tests. For example, put 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is at least two. If not, then perhaps something else.\n\nBut in the current state, the agent hasn't tried that. But given the steps taken, the only time the light turned on was when all three were on. But that contradicts unless the rule requires all three. However, that would mean all three are blickets, but when they were all on, the light is on. But earlier, when 0 and 2 were on (without 1), the light was off. If 0 is a blicket, then that would mean two blickets (0 and 2) were on, but the light was off, which would contradict the rule of at least two. Therefore, 0 can't be a blicket.\n\nWait, but in the last step, when 0,1,2 are on, the light turns on. If the rule is that all three are needed, then they are all blickets. But earlier, when 0 and 2 were on, the light was off. So that would mean that even with two blickets (0 and 2), the machine stays off, which would require all three. So the rule would be that all three must be on the machine. But then why did the light turn on when all three are present? That would mean all three are blickets. But when 0 was on alone, the light was off. So that's possible if the rule is that all blickets must be present. So if all three are blickets, the machine only turns on when all are on. Then in the initial state, object 1 was on alone (light off). Then when 0 and 2 were added, still missing 1 (wait, no, initial state was object 1 on machine, others on floor. Then the agent took 1 off, put 0 on, then added 2. So at that point, machine had 0 and 2 on, light off. Then after removing them and putting 1, then adding 0 and 2, the machine had all three, light on. So the rule would be that all three are blickets and must be on the machine. That would explain the light turning on only when all three are present. But that would mean all three are blickets. But why when 0 and 2 were on (assuming they are blickets), the light didn't turn on? Because the rule requires all three. So if all three are blickets and the machine requires all of them to be present, then the light would only turn on when all three are on. That fits the observations.\n\nBut in that case, the blickets are 0,1,2, and the rule is that all must be on the machine. But how does that fit with the initial state where 1 was on alone (light off). Yes, because the rule requires all three. So the agent's steps would lead to the conclusion that all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous step where 0 and 2 were on (without 1), and the light was off. If all three are required, then that's correct. However, the mutual information definition says a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. If an object is a blicket, then its presence affects the machine's state. If the machine requires all three, then each object's presence is necessary for the machine to be on. Therefore, each object's presence is not independent of the machine's state. So mutual information would be non-zero. Therefore, all three would be blickets.\n\nBut is there a more efficient rule? For example, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket. But then, when 1 was on alone, the light should be on. But it wasn't. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires exactly two blickets. But if all three are blickets, then having two would turn it on. But in that case, when 0 and 2 were on, the light should be on. But it was off. So that's conflicting.\n\nSo the only scenario that fits all observations is that all three objects are blickets, and the machine turns on only when all three are on the machine. Therefore, the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be present. Thus, each object is a blicket, and the rule is that all must be on the machine for it to activate.\n\nBut wait, when the agent added object 2 to the machine (which already had 0 and 1), the light turned on. So that's when all three are present. Earlier, when only two were present (0 and 2), the light was off. That fits the rule. However, in the initial state, object 1 was alone on the machine, and the light was off. If 1 is a blicket, but the machine requires all three, then that's correct. So yes, this seems to fit.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all three objects are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are placed on it."}

So far, I've done several experiments. Let's recap the steps and outcomes.\n\nInitially, the setup was: object 0 on floor, object 1 on machine, object 2 on floor. The machine was off. Then I took object 1 off, leaving all objects on the floor. Then I put object 0 on the machine, but the machine stayed off. Then added object 2, but still off. Then removed both 0 and 2, and put object 1 back on. Machine remained off. Then added 0 and 2 again, and this time when I added object 2, the machine turned on. Then removing object 0 didn't turn it off. Now, with objects 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is on.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 and 2 on the machine, it turned on. Then removing object 0 left the machine still on. So maybe object 2 is a blicket. But what about object 1? When object 1 was alone on the machine, the light was off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Then, when I had objects 1 and 2 on the machine, the light was on. Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, the last steps: After putting object 1 on the machine (alone), machine was off. Then added 0 and 2. When I added object 2 (so objects 0,1,2 were on the machine?), no, wait. Let's look at the history step by step.\n\nWait, after taking object 0 and 2 off, I put object 1 on the machine (so machine has 1). Then I put object 0 on the machine (machine has 0 and 1). Then put object 2 on the machine (machine has 0,1,2). The light turned on when I put object 2 on. Then I took object 0 off (so machine has 1 and 2), and the light stayed on.\n\nSo when objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. But when object 1 was alone, the light was off. So maybe object 2 is a blicket. But also, when objects 0 and 2 were on the machine, the light was off. Wait, no. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the step where I put object 0 on the machine (after having object 1 off), then object 2 on, the light turned on. So machine had 0 and 2, and light turned on. Then removing 0 left 2 on the machine, but the light stayed on. Wait, no. Wait, after putting object 2 on, the light turned on. Then when I took object 0 off, the machine was still on. So with object 2 on the machine, the light is on. So maybe object 2 is a blicket. But earlier, when object 2 was on the machine with object 0 (after putting 0 and 2 on), the light turned on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So perhaps object 2 is a blicket. Then, when object 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. But when object 1 was alone, it was off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But object 2 is a blicket. Then what about object 1? If when 1 is alone, machine is off, but when 1 and 2 are on, machine is on, then 1 might not be a blicket. But earlier, when object 1 was on the machine alone, machine was off. So maybe 1 is not a blicket, 2 is. What about object 0? When 0 was on the machine with 2, the machine turned on. But when 0 was alone (earlier steps), machine was off. So that suggests that 0 is not a blicket. But wait, when 0 and 2 were on the machine, the light turned on. If 2 is a blicket, then even if 0 is present, the machine would turn on. So maybe the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket activates the machine. So if 2 is a blicket, then whenever it's on the machine, the machine is on. But when object 2 was put on the machine with 0 (which is not a blicket), the machine turned on. Then removing 0 (so only 2 remains) kept the machine on. That fits. So object 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut what about when object 1 is on the machine with 2? The machine is on. So that's consistent. But what if object 1 is not a blicket. Then the machine is on because 2 is present. So that works.\n\nBut wait, when object 1 was on the machine alone, the light was off. So 1 is not a blicket. Object 0 was on the machine alone (earlier) and the light was off. So 0 isn't a blicket. Object 2, when on the machine, causes the light to turn on. So 2 is a blicket. Then, the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it. So the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is placed on it. And the blicket is object 2.\n\nBut wait, in the step where objects 0 and 2 were on the machine, the light turned on. Then, when object 0 was removed, the light stayed on. That's consistent with 2 being a blicket. So, the conclusion is that object 2 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it.\n\nBut let's check other possibilities. What if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine? But in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine (alone) and the light was off. If the rule required all blickets to be on, but there's only one blicket (object 2), then putting object 2 on would activate it. But in that case, when objects 1 and 2 are on, the machine would be on, which is what happened. Hmm, but that requires that all blickets are present. But if there are multiple blickets, then all must be on. But in this case, maybe there's only one blicket (object 2). So the rule could be either \"any blicket\" or \"all blickets\". Since there's only one, both would look the same. But to confirm, maybe test if multiple blickets are needed. However, with three objects, maybe there are multiple.\n\nWait, let's see. When I put object 2 on the machine with object 0, the machine turned on. So if object 2 is a blicket, that's enough. If there was another blicket, say object 1, then when 1 and 2 are on, the machine should still be on. But when 1 was alone, the machine was off. So 1 isn't a blicket. So likely, only object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present.\n\nBut let's check another scenario. What if the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on it, and one of them is a blicket. But in the case where object 2 is on the machine alone, the light is on. Wait, when I put object 2 on the machine with object 0, the light turned on. Then when I took object 0 off, leaving 2 alone, the light stayed on. So the machine is on when object 2 is present, regardless of the number of objects. So the rule is presence of any blicket.\n\nTherefore, the blicket is object 2, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is placed on it."}

From the interaction logs, I need to look at when the machine's light turned on or off based on the objects placed on it.\n\nInitially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. Then, they took object 1 off, put object 0 on the machine (light stayed off). Then added object 2, still off. Then they removed both 0 and 2, put 1 back on, then added 0 and 2 again. The light turned on when object 2 was placed on the machine along with 0, but after removing 0, the light stayed on with just 1 and 2. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, let's go step by step:\n\n- When object 1 was on the machine initially, light was off. Taking it off and putting 0 and 2 on didn't turn it on. Then they took both off and put 1 back on, light still off. Then added 0 and 2 again. When they put 2 on after 0, the light turned on. Then when they took 0 off, leaving 1 and 2 on the machine, the light stayed on. Hmm. Wait, after putting 0 and 2 on the machine, the light came on. Then when 0 was removed, the light remained on. That suggests that having object 2 on the machine might be the key, but maybe there's a combination. \n\nWait, the critical point is when they put object 2 on the machine after 0 was already there. The light turned on. Then when they took 0 off, leaving 1 and 2 on, the light stayed on. Wait, no. Let me check the exact steps:\n\nAfter several moves, they had:\n\n- Put object 0 on machine (light off)\n- Put object 2 on machine (light turns on)\nSo when 0 and 2 are both on, the light is on. Then they take 0 off, leaving object 1 and 2 on the machine. Wait, no: after putting 0 and 2 on the machine (with 1 on the floor), the machine light is on. Then taking 0 off, so only 2 is on the machine. But in the 'look' command after that, it says objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the last steps before exit:\n\nThey took object 0 off the machine, leaving object 1 and 2 on the machine? Wait, no. Let me recount the steps:\n\nAfter putting object 1 on the machine (light off), then:\n\n- put object 0 on machine (light off)\n- put object 2 on machine (light now on)\nSo objects on machine: 0,1,2? Wait, no. Wait, when they put object 0 on, the machine had object 1 on it. Then put object 2 on. So machine has 1,0,2? Wait, no, initial positions after taking 1 off and putting 0 and 2 on:\n\nWait, let me recheck the sequence:\n\nOriginal setup: object 1 was on machine. Then:\n\n- take object 1 off (now machine empty)\n- put object 0 on (machine has 0, light off)\n- put object 2 on (machine has 0 and 2, light off)\n- Then take both off, put object 1 on (machine has 1, light off)\n- put object 0 on (machine has 1 and 0, light off)\n- put object 2 on (machine has 1,0,2, and light turns on)\nThen take object 0 off (machine has 1 and 2, light remains on)\n\nWait, but when they put object 2 on the machine after 0 was added to 1, the light turned on. Then removing 0, the light stays on. So the presence of 2 and 1 might be sufficient, but that's conflicting. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. If object 2 is a blicket, and maybe object 1 or 0 is also a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, when objects 0 and 2 are on together, the machine turns on. Then when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2 on, but the light stays on. Wait, but in that case, 1 might be a blicket too. Or perhaps the machine stays on once triggered, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The light's state changes when objects are added or removed. So when they took 0 off, leaving 1 and 2 on, the light remained on. That suggests that 2 is a blicket, and maybe 1 is not. Because when 2 is on the machine, even with 1 (which was on the machine initially when the light was off), but adding 2 caused the light to turn on. But when 1 was alone, the light was off. When 1 and 2 were on the machine (after removing 0), the light stayed on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But that can't be because when 1 was on the machine alone, the light was off. Wait, but when 1 was on the machine, maybe 1 isn't a blicket. So putting 2 on the machine with 0 made the light turn on. Then when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2 on, but 1 isn't a blicket, but 2 is. So the machine would stay on as long as 2 is present. But why did the light stay on when 0 was removed? Because 2 was still there. So the machine's rule is that it's on if any blicket is on it. So object 2 is a blicket. Then, when they put 2 on the machine, even with others, it turns on. Then, when they remove 0, the light remains on because 2 is still there. So 2 is a blicket. What about object 0? When they put 0 and 2 on the machine, the light turned on. But if 2 is a blicket, then the presence of 2 alone would be enough. So why when they put 0 and 2 on, the light turned on. But earlier, when they put 0 and 2 on the machine (without 1), the light was off. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nAfter taking object 1 off, they put 0 on (light off), then put 2 on (light still off). Then took both off. Then put 1 on (light off), then put 0 on (light off), then put 2 on (light on). So in that case, when 1, 0, and 2 were on the machine, the light turned on. But when only 0 and 2 were on (without 1), the light was off. So that suggests that the combination of 0,1,2 is required? But that's unlikely. Alternatively, the presence of 1 and 2 together. But when 1 was on the machine alone, light was off. When 1 and 0 were on, light off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. If 2 is a blicket, and either 0 or 1 is also a blicket. But let's see:\n\nScenario 1: Put 0 and 2 on machine (light off). Then put 1 on (if 1 is a blicket, then 0,1,2: maybe two blickets would turn it on). But in the log, when they put 0 on, then 2, the light turned on. Wait, no. Let me check the exact steps again:\n\nAfter taking 0 and 2 off, they put 1 on (light off). Then put 0 on (light off). Then put 2 on (light turns on). So the machine has 1,0,2 on it. But when they added 2, the light turned on. Then they took 0 off (machine has 1 and 2), light stays on. So if 2 is a blicket and 1 is not, then having 2 on the machine would be sufficient. But when 2 was on the machine earlier with 0 (without 1), the light was off. Wait, in the first steps:\n\n- After taking 1 off, put 0 on (light off)\n- put 2 on (light off)\nSo with 0 and 2 on the machine, light was off. Then later, when 1,0,2 are on, the light turns on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2, light stays on. That suggests that the presence of 1 and 2 together is sufficient. But when 1 was alone, light was off. So maybe 1 and 2 together are blickets. But then, when 0 and 2 were on, light off, which would suggest 0 is not a blicket, but 2 is only a blicket when combined with 1. But that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then when they are both on the machine, the light is on. Let's see:\n\nIn the final state, after removing 0, the machine has 1 and 2. The light is on. So if both 1 and 2 are blickets, then that fits. But earlier, when 1 was alone, light was off, so that would require that two blickets are needed. So the rule is that the machine turns on when two or more blickets are present. Then, when 1 and 2 are on, light is on. But when 0 and 2 were on (without 1), light was off, which would mean that 0 is not a blicket, and 2 is a blicket. But then 2 alone wouldn't trigger the machine. Hmm, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is present. But that doesn't fit because when 1 and 2 are both on, the light is on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. But if 1 is a blicket, then when it was alone, the light should have been on. But initially, when object 1 was on the machine, the light was off. So that can't be. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. If there's only one blicket (object 2), then when it's on the machine, the light turns on. But in the earlier case, when they put 0 and 2 on the machine, the light was off. But later, when they put 1,0,2 on, the light turned on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 on, light stays on. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the machine's state is updated only when you perform an action. Let me reconstruct the exact steps:\n\n1. Initial state: objects 0 (floor), 1 (machine), 2 (floor). Light off.\n\n2. take object 1 off machine. Now objects 0 (floor), 1 (floor), 2 (floor). Light off.\n\n3. put object 0 on machine. Now machine has 0. Light off.\n\n4. put object 2 on machine. Now machine has 0 and 2. Light off.\n\n5. look: objects 0 and 2 on machine. Light off.\n\n6. take object 2 off. Machine has 0. Light off.\n\n7. take object 0 off. Machine empty. Light off.\n\n8. put object 1 on machine. Machine has 1. Light off.\n\n9. put object 0 on machine. Machine has 1 and 0. Light off.\n\n10. put object 2 on machine. Now machine has 1,0,2. Light turns on.\n\n11. take object 0 off. Machine has 1 and 2. Light remains on.\n\nSo after step 10, when adding object 2 to the machine (which already had 1 and 0), the light turns on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2, light stays on.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of object 2 is causing the light to turn on. Because when 2 was added, even with others, the light turned on. But when 2 was on the machine with 0 earlier (without 1), the light didn't turn on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when object 2 is present along with at least one other object. But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, object 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket to be on. But when 2 was on with 0, light was off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly object 2 is on. Wait, but in the last step, when 1 and 2 are on, the light is on. So that can't be. Alternatively, the machine turns on if object 2 is present, regardless of others. But in the initial case where 2 was on the machine with 0, the light was off. That contradicts that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if the total number of blickets on it is odd. Suppose 2 is a blicket. Then when 2 is added alone, it's odd (1), so light on. But earlier, when 2 was added with 0 (non-blicket), the total is 1 (still odd), so light should be on. But in that case, the light was off. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires all blickets to be on. If there are two blickets, say 1 and 2, then when both are on, the light is on. If only one is on, it's off. So when 1 was alone, off. When 2 was added to 1, light on. When 2 was added to 0, light off (since 1 is not there). But in the final step, after removing 0, 1 and 2 are on, light on. So that fits. So 1 and 2 are blickets. The rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But how many blickets are there? If it's 1 and 2, then when both are on, light on. But when they put 0 and 2 on earlier (without 1), the light was off. Then when they added 1,0,2, light on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 (both blickets), light stays on. So the rule would be that all blickets must be on the machine. But if 1 and 2 are blickets, then when they are both on, light on. If that's the case, then object 0 is not a blicket. Because when 0 was on with 2 (without 1), light was off. So 0 isn't a blicket. So answer for object 0: False.\n\nBut wait, in the scenario where they added 0 and 2, light was off. But when they added 1,0,2, light turned on. If the rule is that all blickets must be present, and the blickets are 1 and 2, then when both are on the machine, light turns on. But in that case, when they added 2 to 1 and 0 (which is 1 and 2 on the machine), the light turned on. That fits. Then removing 0 doesn't affect because the blickets are still there. So yes, 0 is not a blicket. So the answer is False."}

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

So, from the interactions, the machine's light turns on when certain objects are placed on it. The key is to see when the machine's state changes and which objects are involved.\n\nStarting with the initial setup: objects 0 and 2 were on the floor, and object 1 was on the machine. The light was off. Then, when object 1 was taken off and later put back on, the light stayed off. \n\nWhen objects 0 and 2 were both placed on the machine (after putting 0 and then 2), the light turned on. But when object 0 was taken off, leaving 1 and 2 on the machine, the light remained on. Wait, no\u2014wait. Let me check the steps again. \n\nWait, after putting object 0 and 2 on the machine, the light turned on. Then when object 0 was removed, leaving 1 and 2 on the machine, the light stayed on. Wait, no. Wait, let me trace:\n\nAt one point, they put object 1 on the machine (after taking others off), and the light was off. Then they added object 0 and 2, and the light turned on. Then when object 0 was taken off, leaving objects 1 and 2 on the machine, the light was still on. But when object 1 was on the machine alone, the light was off. \n\nWait, let's reconstruct:\n\nStep 1: Initially, object 1 is on the machine, others on floor. Light is off.\n\nAfter taking 1 off and putting 0 and 2 on the machine, light remains off. Then putting 2 on the machine again? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact sequence.\n\nWait, let's go through each action:\n\n1. Take object 1 off the machine. Now all objects are on the floor. Light is off.\n2. Put object 0 on machine. Light remains off.\n3. Put object 2 on machine. Light remains off.\n4. Then take both 0 and 2 off. Light remains off.\n5. Put object 1 on machine. Light is still off.\n6. Then put object 0 and 2 on the machine again. After putting 2 on, the light turns on. So with objects 0, 1, 2 on the machine? Wait no. Wait, after step 5, object 1 is on the machine. Then they put object 0 on (so machine has 1 and 0), light off. Then put object 2 on (machine has 1, 0, 2), light turns on. Then take object 0 off (machine has 1 and 2), light remains on.\n\nSo when objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. But when object 1 was alone on the machine, the light was off. So adding object 2 to object 1 caused the light to turn on. Wait, no. Wait, after putting object 0 on (machine has 0 and 1?), no. Let's check the exact steps again.\n\nWait, the user's actions:\n\nAfter taking object 1 off, they put 0 on, then 2 on. Then look: both 0 and 2 are on the machine, but light is off. Then they take 2 and 0 off. Then put 1 on (alone), light off. Then put 0 on, then 2 on. At this point, the machine has 0,1,2? Wait no. Wait, initial after step 5: machine has 1. Then step 6: put 0 on machine. So machine has 1 and 0. Light is off. Then step 7: put 2 on machine. Now machine has 1,0,2. Then light turns on. Then taking 0 off leaves 1 and 2 on machine, light stays on.\n\nSo when 1 and 2 are on the machine together, the light is on. But when 1 was alone, it was off. So maybe the presence of 2 with 1 makes the machine turn on. But wait, when 0 and 2 were on the machine (without 1), the light was off. Then adding 0 and 2 to 1 caused it to turn on, and removing 0 leaves 1 and 2, light stays on. So the presence of 2 and 1 together turns it on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present, but maybe there's an AND condition. Wait, but in the case where 0 and 2 were on the machine, the light was off. Then when adding 1 (and 0 and 2), the light turned on. Then removing 0 (so 1 and 2 remain), light stays on. So the key was adding 2 and 1 together? Or maybe the presence of 2 is a blicket. Wait, but when 2 was on the machine with 0 and 1, the light was on. When 2 was on with 0 (without 1), it was off. When 2 was on with 1 (after removing 0), it stayed on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, but only when combined with 1? Or perhaps 2 is a blicket and 1 is not. Wait, but earlier when 1 was on alone, the light was off. When 2 was added to 1, the light turned on. So perhaps 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when 2 is on the machine alone, the light should turn on. But when they put 2 on the machine with 0 (without 1), the light was off. Wait, no. Let's check the exact steps again.\n\nLet me list the key steps:\n\n- After taking 1 off, put 0 on machine. Light off. Then put 2 on machine. Light off. So objects 0 and 2 on machine, light off. So neither 0 nor 2 alone (or together) activate the machine. Then they take 0 and 2 off, put 1 on machine. Light off. So 1 alone doesn't activate. Then put 0 on (machine has 0 and 1), light off. Then put 2 on (machine has 0,1,2), light turns on. Then take 0 off (machine has 1 and 2), light remains on. So when 1 and 2 are on, light is on. So the presence of both 1 and 2 causes the light to turn on. But when 1 was alone, it didn't. So the rule might be that both 1 and 2 need to be on the machine. But wait, in the step where 1 and 2 are on the machine (after removing 0), the light is on. But in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine (alone) and the light was off. So when 1 and 2 are both on, the light is on. That suggests that both 1 and 2 are blickets, but the rule is that both need to be present. Wait, but then when 0 and 2 and 1 are all on, the light is on. So the presence of 1 and 2 together triggers it. So the rule is that the machine turns on if both 1 and 2 are on it. So 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is the conjunction of 1 and 2. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of blickets is even or something else. But given the data points:\n\n- 1 alone: off\n- 0 and 2: off\n- 1, 0, 2: on\n- 1 and 2: on\n\nSo the machine turns on when both 1 and 2 are on. So 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. But then why does the machine stay on when 0 is added? Because 0 isn't a blicket. Wait, no\u2014when 0 is added along with 1 and 2, the light is on. Then when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2, it stays on. So the presence of 0 isn't affecting it. So the machine's state depends only on whether 1 and 2 are both present. So both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. But in that case, the answer to whether object 2 is a blicket is True. Because if the machine's state depends on 2 being present (when 1 is also present), then 2 is a blicket. Because mutual information between 2's state and machine's state is non-zero. So when 2 is present (with 1), the machine is on. When 2 is absent (even if 1 is present), the machine is off. Therefore, object 2's presence is informative of the machine's state, hence it's a blicket. Similarly for object 1. So object 2 is a blicket. So the answer should be True."}
