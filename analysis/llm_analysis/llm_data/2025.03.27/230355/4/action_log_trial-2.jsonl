I'll put it on the machine. If the machine turns on, then maybe object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. Let me try that.\n\nWait, but the rule might require more than one object. Like, maybe the machine turns on only when multiple blickets are placed. Hmm. But starting with individual testing makes sense to isolate variables. If putting one alone doesn't activate it, then maybe combinations are needed. But the problem says that a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So mutual information exists. So if the presence of the object affects the probability of the machine being on, it's a blicket. \n\nSo first step: put object 0 on the machine. Check if the light turns on. If yes, maybe 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe not, but maybe it's part of a combination. But since mutual information is key, even if it's part of a necessary combination, each one in the combination would be a blicket. Because their presence affects the machine's state.\n\nSo let's try putting 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens."}

Let's start by recalling what's happened so far. The user tried putting object 0 and 1 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Now, both 0 and 1 are on the machine, and 2 is on the floor. The machine is still off.\n\nHmm, maybe putting two objects isn't enough, or maybe one of them isn't a blicket. Wait, but the definition says a blicket's state has mutual information with the machine. So if adding an object changes the machine's state, that object is a blicket. But in this case, adding 0 and 1 didn't turn it on. So maybe neither is a blicket, or maybe the rule requires a specific combination. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. If there are multiple blickets, maybe all need to be present. But since 0 and 1 are on the machine and it's still off, maybe 2 is the blicket. Let me test that. Let's try putting object 2 on the machine. If that turns it on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe the rule is more complex, like needing exactly one blicket or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But since adding 0 and 1 didn't work, perhaps they aren't blickets. So adding 2 might be the key. Let's try that. \n\nWait, but what if the rule is that the machine turns on only if exactly one blicket is on it? Suppose 0 and 1 are both blickets, but when both are on, they cancel each other out. That's possible but maybe less likely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. But without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nSo the next logical step is to test object 2. Since 0 and 1 together didn't work, maybe adding 2 will. Let's put object 2 on the machine now. If the light turns on, then maybe all three are needed, or 2 is the only blicket. If it doesn't, then perhaps the rule is more complex, like a specific combination. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that only one blicket is present. So if 2 is a blicket, putting it alone would turn it on. Let's try that. But first, the current state has 0 and 1 on the machine. So maybe I should take them off first to test 2 alone. Let me plan: take off 0 and 1, then put 2 on. Let's see. \n\nWait, but each step counts. Let's consider the steps taken so far. The user already used two steps to put 0 and 1 on. Then three 'look' commands. That's five steps. So remaining steps are 27. So I need to be efficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But since putting 0 and 1 didn't work, they might not be blickets. So perhaps 2 is the only blicket. Let me test that. So first, take off 0 and 1, then put 2 on. \n\nBut to do that, the commands would be 'take object 0 off machine', 'take object 1 off machine', then 'put object 2 on machine'. But that's three steps. Alternatively, maybe just put 2 on top of the existing objects. If the machine turns on, then 2 is the blicket. But if adding 2 to 0 and 1 makes it turn on, then maybe the rule is that the presence of 2 (a blicket) activates it regardless of others. Or maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on. Suppose there's only one blicket (object 2). Then putting it on would activate the machine. \n\nSo current state: 0 and 1 are on machine. Machine is off. Let's try adding 2. If the machine turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe none are, or the rule is different. \n\nSo next command: put object 2 on machine. Let's see what happens."}

Take 0 off (1 and 2 remain): light turns off.\n\nSo, the machine was on when all three were on. Removing any one (0) turned it off. That suggests that all three are required for the machine to turn on. But if all three are required, then all three would be blickets. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when a specific combination is present. Let's test further.\n\nBut wait, after step 3, all three are on and the light is on. Then taking 0 off makes it go off. If the rule was that the presence of object 2 is necessary, then having 2 on the machine should make it turn on regardless of others. But when 0 was removed (leaving 1 and 2), the light went off. That suggests that 2 alone isn't sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Let's see. Suppose objects 0 and 2 are blickets. When 0 and 1 are on, only 0 is a blicket, so not enough. When 2 is added (0,1,2 on), maybe the rule is that at least two blickets are needed. But then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) would have 2 as a blicket, but maybe 1 isn't. So the count drops to one, hence off. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on only when all blickets are on it. If the blickets are 0,1,2, then all must be on. But when I took off 0, it turned off. That supports that all three are blickets. But when I had 0 and 1 on (without 2), the machine was off. Adding 2 made it on. So if all three are blickets, then the rule might be that all blickets must be present. But then, if all three are blickets, the machine would only turn on when all are on. But in that case, putting 2 on the machine (with 0 and 1 already on) would turn it on. Then taking any off would turn it off. So maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Then all three are blickets. But how do we confirm?\n\nAlternatively, maybe only object 2 is a blicket, but the machine requires that all objects on the machine are blickets. So when 0 and 1 (non-blickets) are on, adding 2 (a blicket) would mean that there's a mix. But the machine would only turn on if all on it are blickets. Wait, but in that case, when 0 and 1 (non-blickets) are on, adding 2 (a blicket) would mean the machine has non-blickets, so it stays off. But in the previous steps, when all three were on, the light turned on. So that would contradict that rule. Unless the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket, but that doesn't fit because when 0 and 1 were on (assuming they aren't blickets), adding 2 (a blicket) would make it turn on. But in the actual steps, adding 2 made it turn on. Wait, yes. So if 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it, then when 0 and 1 (non-blickets) are on, adding 2 (a blicket) would make the machine turn on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) would still have 2 on, so the machine should stay on. But in the steps, taking 0 off made it turn off. So that contradicts that rule. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that exactly one blicket is present. If 2 is the only blicket, then when you add it, the machine turns on. But when you take off 0 (leaving 1 and 2), the machine would stay on. But in the steps, it turned off. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that the number of blickets on it is even. But in this case, adding 2 (if it's a blicket) would make the count 1 (assuming 0 and 1 are not), so the light would turn on only if the count is even. But that seems less likely.\n\nWait, let's consider another angle. When all three are on, the machine is on. Removing any one (object 0) makes it off. So perhaps the machine is on only when all three are on. Then all three would be blickets. But then why did the machine not turn on when 0 and 1 were on? Because 2 wasn't on. So if all three must be on, then they are all blickets. But the problem states that a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state is dependent on the presence of all three, then each of them is a blicket. But perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are present, regardless of which they are. But that would mean all three are blickets. But maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when the total number of objects on it is three. But that's not the case because if you have three objects on, it's on. But if that's the case, then the blicket concept is irrelevant. But the problem says that some objects are blickets, and the machine's activation depends on them. So the rule must relate to the presence of specific objects (blickets), not the count.\n\nWait, let's think again. When objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, the light is off. Adding object 2 turns it on. Then removing object 0 (leaving 1 and 2) turns it off. So the presence of object 2 alone (with 1) isn't enough. But when all three are on, it's on. So maybe the machine requires that all blickets are present. If object 2 is the only blicket, then putting it on should turn the machine on. But when 0 and 1 are on, adding 2 turns it on. But then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) would still have the blicket (2) on the machine. So why did the light turn off? That doesn't fit. Therefore, maybe the presence of object 0 is also a blicket. So the machine requires both 0 and 2 to be on. Let's test that hypothesis.\n\nSuppose objects 0 and 2 are blickets. The rule is that both must be on the machine. When I put 0 and 1 on, the machine is off (missing 2). Adding 2 (now 0,1,2) makes it on (since both 0 and 2 are present). Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) means only 2 is present, so the machine turns off. That fits. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be on the machine. Then those two are blickets. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that at least two blickets are needed. If objects 0,1,2 are blickets, then any two would trigger. But when 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. So that's not the case. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that exactly two specific blickets must be on. Let's say 0 and 2. So when both are on, the machine is on. So in the case where 0,1,2 are on, the machine is on because 0 and 2 are present. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2, so only 2 is present (a single blicket), so the machine turns off. That would fit. So the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. But how to confirm this?\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I should try other combinations. For example, take all off, then put 0 and 2 on. If the machine turns on, that supports the rule. Then remove one of them and see if it turns off. But in the current state, after taking 0 off, the machine is off. The current state has objects 1 and 2 on the machine, and the light is off. So perhaps if I take 1 off and put 0 back on, leaving 0 and 2 on, the machine should turn on. Let's try that.\n\nBut I need to proceed step by step. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state after the last action: objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. The light is off. So next steps could be taking 1 off and putting 0 on again. Let's see.\n\nBut since the user's next command is to be output, I need to decide what to do next. Let's think of possible commands to test the hypothesis.\n\nIf the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be on the machine, then:\n\n- Putting 0 and 2 on (without 1) should turn the machine on.\n- Putting 2 alone shouldn't turn it on.\n- Putting 0 alone shouldn't turn it on.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on (without 2), the machine was off. Adding 2 (making all three) turned it on. Removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) turned it off. So if 0 and 2 are the blickets, then having both on the machine should activate it, regardless of others. So let's test that.\n\nCurrent state: objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. Light is off. Let's take object 1 off. Then the machine will have only object 2. If the machine requires both 0 and 2, then putting 0 on again (with 2) should turn it on.\n\nSo possible steps:\n\nTake object 1 off the machine. Then the machine has only object 2. If the light is still off, then putting 0 on (with 2) should turn it on. Let's do that.\n\nBut I need to output the next command. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, take object 1 off the machine. So command: take object 1 off machine.\n\nWait, but the user's last action was 'take object 0 off machine', leading to the current state where objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. Then the light is off. The next step would be to try to take object 1 off to see if the machine's state changes.\n\nSo the next command could be: take object 1 off machine.\n\nAfter that, the machine would have only object 2. If the light remains off, then putting object 0 back on (with 2) should turn it on if 0 and 2 are the blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 2 is the only blicket, but the machine requires that all objects on it are blickets. So if non-blickets are on, the machine won't turn on. So when objects 0 and 1 (non-blickets) are on, adding 2 (a blicket) would mean the machine has non-blickets (0 and 1) and a blicket (2), so it stays off. Wait, but in the previous steps, when all three were on, the light turned on. That contradicts that rule. Because if 0 and 1 are non-blickets, then even with 2, the machine has non-blickets, so it should stay off. But it turned on. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. This is getting a bit confusing. Let's summarize the observations again:\n\n- 0 and 1 on: light off.\n- Add 2: light on.\n- Remove 0: light off.\n\nPossible rules:\n\n1. All three must be on (so all are blickets). But then, each object's presence is necessary. So each is a blicket because their absence affects the machine.\n\n2. Exactly two specific objects (like 0 and 2) must be on. So those two are blickets. Then, when both are on, regardless of others, the machine is on. But in the case where all three are on, including 1 (non-blicket), the machine is on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) turns it off. So that fits.\n\n3. The machine is on if at least one blicket is present, but only if no non-blickets are present. So if any non-blicket is on the machine, it stays off. So if 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not, then when 0 and 1 are on, adding 2 (a blicket) would require that no non-blickets are present. But since 0 and 1 are non-blickets, the machine stays off. But in the steps, adding 2 turned it on. So that can't be.\n\nAnother approach: mutual information. A blicket is an object whose presence affects the machine's state. So, if an object is a blicket, then there's some scenario where adding or removing it changes the machine's state.\n\nIn the steps:\n\n- Adding object 2 caused the machine to turn on. So object 2's presence might be a factor.\n\nBut then, when object 0 was removed (with 1 and 2 still on), the machine turned off. So the absence of object 0 caused the machine to turn off. That suggests that object 0 is also a blicket, because its presence was required for the machine to be on.\n\nWait, but when object 0 was on the machine along with 1 (before adding 2), the machine was off. Adding 2 turned it on. So object 2's presence is necessary. Then, removing object 0 (leaving 1 and 2) turned it off. So object 0's presence is also necessary. So both 0 and 2 are blickets. Because their presence affects the machine's state. Let's see:\n\n- If object 0 is a blicket: When it's on the machine, does it affect the machine's state? Well, when it's on with 1, the machine is off. But when 2 is added, the machine is on. When 0 is removed, the machine turns off. So the presence of 0 in combination with 2 is necessary. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. Thus, they are both blickets.\n\nBut then, what about object 1? When 1 is present with 0 and 2, the machine is on. But when 1 is present with 0 and 2, the machine is on. But if 1 is not a blicket, then its presence or absence doesn't affect the machine. So, if 0 and 2 are the blickets, and the rule is that both must be present, then regardless of 1's presence, the machine should be on as long as 0 and 2 are on. But in the previous steps, when 0 and 2 were on (along with 1), the machine was on. Then, when 0 was removed (leaving 1 and 2), the machine turned off. So that fits. But what if we remove object 1 and have just 0 and 2 on the machine? The machine should be on. But we haven't tested that yet.\n\nSo the next step is to test whether having only 0 and 2 on the machine turns it on. To do that, I need to take object 1 off the machine. Currently, after taking 0 off, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. Let's take object 1 off, leaving object 2 alone. If the machine remains off, then putting 0 back on should turn it on. Let's try that.\n\nSo the commands would be:\n\n1. take object 1 off machine.\n\nIf the machine remains off, then:\n\n2. put object 0 on machine.\n\nIf the machine turns on, then that confirms that having 0 and 2 (but not 1) is sufficient. So the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present, regardless of others. Thus, they are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, if after taking object 1 off, the machine has only object 2. If the light is still off, then adding 0 to it (with 2) turns it on, that would confirm that 0 and 2 are necessary.\n\nSo let's proceed with that.\n\nCurrent state: objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. Light is off.\n\nNext command: take object 1 off machine.\n\nAfter that, the machine has object 2 alone. If the light is still off, then put 0 on machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present.\n\nBut according to previous steps, when 0 and 2 were on the machine along with 1, the light was on. Removing 1 leaves 0 and 2. If the light stays on, then the presence of 1 is irrelevant. But in the earlier steps, when 0 was removed (leaving 1 and 2), the light turned off. So that suggests that 0's presence is required.\n\nWait, but when all three were on (0,1,2), the light was on. Removing 0 left 1 and 2, and the light turned off. So the machine's state depends on 0's presence. But when 0 and 1 were on (without 2), the light was off. Adding 2 made it on. So 2's presence is also required. So the machine requires both 0 and 2 to be present. So they are both blickets.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both object 0 and object 2 are on it. Object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nTo confirm this, we need to test:\n\n- Put 0 and 2 on the machine (without 1). If the light turns on, then the hypothesis is correct.\n\nCurrently, after the last action (taking 0 off), the machine has 1 and 2. Let's take 1 off, then add 0.\n\nSo steps:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nThen the machine has object 2. Light remains off.\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then the rule is that 0 and 2 must be present. Then, taking either off would turn it off.\n\nBut given the step limit, perhaps it's better to proceed with these commands.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should exit now if they think they have the answer. But I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's proceed with taking object 1 off."}

So, the machine turns on when certain objects (blickets) are placed on it. From the previous steps, when I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. But when I added object 2, the light turned on. Then, when I removed objects 0 and 1, leaving only object 2, the light turned off again. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, after putting all three on, the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving 2) made the light off. But when I had only 2 on the machine earlier, the light was on. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recap the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put 1 on machine: light off.\n3. Put 2 on machine: light turns on. So with all three, it's on.\n4. Then take off 0: light turns off. Then take off 1: light stays off. Now only 2 is on the machine, but light is off. But when I first put 2 on with 0 and 1 already there, it turned on. But when 2 is alone, it's off. Hmm. That suggests that maybe the machine requires all three to be on? But when all three were on, the light was on. Then removing any one of them turns it off. But that would mean all three are blickets. But when I first added 0 and 1, it didn't turn on. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is present. Wait, but adding 2 made it turn on when others were already there. Alternatively, maybe 2 is the only blicket, but the machine only activates when it's the only one on. But that doesn't fit because when all three were on, the light was on. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check again. Let me think. When I put 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. Then, when I remove 0, the light goes off. Wait, but if 2 is a blicket, then having 2 on the machine should activate it. But when 2 was alone, after removing 0 and 1, the light was off. So that's conflicting. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on. If 2 is a blicket, but the machine didn't turn on when 2 was alone. So maybe there's more than one blicket. Wait, maybe the machine requires at least two blickets? Let's see. When I had 0 and 1 on, maybe they are not blickets. Then adding 2 (a non-blicket) didn't help. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the machine is activated by the presence of a single blicket, but only when certain others are present. This is getting confusing.\n\nWait, let's look at the interactions step by step:\n\n- Initial state: all objects on floor. Machine off.\n- Put 0 on: machine off.\n- Put 1 on: machine still off.\n- Put 2 on: machine turns on.\n- So with 0,1,2 on, machine is on.\n- Then take 0 off: machine turns off. So now 1 and 2 are on.\n- Take 1 off: machine remains off. Now only 2 is on, machine off.\n\nSo when only 2 is on, machine is off. When 0,1,2 are on, machine is on. When 1 and 2 are on, machine is off. When 0 and 1 are on, machine is off. So the machine only turns on when all three are present. That would suggest all three are blickets. But that contradicts the initial step where adding 2 caused the machine to turn on when 0 and 1 were already there. Wait, but maybe the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be on. If all three are blickets, then when they are all on, the machine is on. But then, if you remove any, it turns off. That would fit. But when 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. Then adding 2 (a blicket) made all three on, so machine on. Then removing 0 (a blicket) leaves two blickets on, which isn't all, so machine off. Then removing 1 (another blicket) leaves only 2, which is a blicket, but not all, so machine remains off. So in that case, all three are blickets. But why did adding 2 turn it on when 0 and 1 were already there? Because adding 2 completed the set. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 0,1,2. But that seems a bit counterintuitive. But maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires exactly one blicket. But when I put 2 on alone, it didn't turn on. Wait, when I first put 0 and 1 on, then added 2, the machine turned on. Then when I removed 0, machine turned off. So maybe 2 is a blicket, but only when combined with 0 and 1. But that doesn't fit the definition. The blicket's state must have mutual information with the machine. So if the machine turns on only when 2 is present along with others, but not alone, that complicates things. But the definition says a blicket's presence affects the machine's state. So if 2 is a blicket, then when it's on the machine, the machine's state depends on it. But in this case, when 2 is on alone, the machine is off. When 2 is on with others, machine is on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. But then which objects are blickets?\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. But in that case, adding 0 and 1 didn't turn it on, but adding 2 did. Wait, no. Because when 0 and 1 were on, adding 2 turned it on. If 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not, then the presence of 2 (a single blicket) would activate the machine. But why did it activate only when 2 was added to the existing ones? Unless the machine's rule is that it activates when a blicket is present, regardless of other objects. But in that case, when 2 is alone, it should activate. But earlier, when I removed 0 and 1, leaving 2 on the machine, the machine turned off. That contradicts that. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all blickets are present. If 2 is the only blicket, then when it's on the machine, the machine should be on. But when it was alone, the machine was off. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Let's think: when 0 and 1 are on, machine is off. Adding 2 (assuming 2 is a blicket) would make two blickets (if either 0 or 1 is also a blicket). But this is getting too complicated. Let's try to test more combinations.\n\nWait, after putting all three on, the machine is on. Then taking off 0 makes it off. Then taking off 1 leaves 2 alone, which is off. So perhaps the machine requires all three to be on. But that would mean all three are blickets, because their presence is required. But when I put 0 and 1 on, the machine was off. Adding 2 made it on. So the machine only turns on when all three are on. Therefore, the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all three objects are on it. But that would mean all three are blickets. But according to the definition, a blicket is an object whose presence is not independent of the machine's state. If the machine only turns on when all three are present, then each object's presence is dependent on the machine's state. Because if any one is missing, the machine is off. So each object is a blicket. Therefore, the blickets are 0,1,2, and the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are placed on it.\n\nBut wait, let's test another scenario. What if I put 2 on the machine first. Let me try that. But I can't go back. But according to previous steps, when I put 2 on the machine with 0 and 1 already there, it turned on. When 2 was alone, after removing 0 and 1, it was off. So that suggests that 2 alone doesn't activate the machine, but 2 with others does. But that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. For example, if 1 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on, the machine is on. But when I had 0 and 1 on (assuming 1 is a blicket and 0 is not), the machine was off. Then adding 2 (a blicket) made two blickets (1 and 2), so machine on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 and 2, so machine stays on. But in the previous steps, after removing 0, the machine turned off. So that contradicts that. Therefore, that can't be the case.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present, and that blicket is 2. But when I put 2 on with others, the machine turns on. But when I put 2 alone, the machine is off. That doesn't make sense. Unless the rule is that the machine turns on when only one blicket is present. If 2 is a blicket, then when it's alone, the machine should be on. But in the previous steps, when 2 was alone, the machine was off. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- Put 0 on machine: light off.\n- Put 1 on machine: light off.\n- Put 2 on machine: light turns on. So all three on, light on.\n- Take 0 off: light turns off. Now 1 and 2 on.\n- Take 1 off: light remains off. Now only 2 on.\n\nSo when 2 is alone, light is off. When all three are on, light is on. When any one is missing, light is off. So the rule is that all three must be on. Therefore, all three are blickets. Because each of their presence is required for the machine to be on. So their presence is not independent of the machine's state. If any one is missing, machine is off. Therefore, mutual information exists between each object's presence and the machine's state. Hence, all three are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are placed on it.\n\nBut wait, the user might have a different rule. Maybe the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. But in this case, adding 2 caused it to turn on when 0 and 1 were already there. If 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not, then having one blicket (2) wouldn't trigger it. Unless the rule is that at least one blicket is present. But then having 2 alone should turn it on. But that wasn't the case. So perhaps all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present.\n\nBut why did putting 2 on cause the machine to turn on when 0 and 1 were already there? Because that completed the set. So yes, the rule is that all three must be on. Therefore, the blickets are all three objects, and the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all three are placed on it."}

So, from the interactions, the machine's light turned on only when all three objects were placed on it. But when I took off object 0 and 1, leaving only object 2 on the machine, the light turned off. Hmm.\n\nWait, when object 2 was added to the machine along with 0 and 1, the light came on. Then, removing 0 and 1 made it turn off. But when only object 2 was on the machine, the light stayed off. So maybe the machine requires all three objects to be on? But that doesn't make sense because when all three were on, it was on, but when only 2 was on, it's off. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, initially, putting 0 and 1 on the machine didn't activate it. Then adding 2 made it turn on. Then, taking 0 and 1 off left only 2 on the machine, and the light turned off. So when only 2 is on, it's off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only if all three are on. But that's not possible because when all three were on, it turned on. But when you take any one off, it turns off. So that would mean all three are blickets. But the problem is, in the initial steps, when 0 and 1 were on, adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe the presence of object 2 is necessary. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on. Wait, no. Because when 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. So three objects on made it turn on. Then removing 0 and 1, leaving only 2, which is one object, the machine turned off. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. But which ones?\n\nWait, but the key is that the machine's state depends on the blickets. So a blicket is an object whose presence affects the machine's state. So if the machine turns on when all three are present, then each of them is a blicket. But wait, when all three are on, the machine is on. Then removing any one (like 0) makes it turn off. So each of them is necessary. Therefore, all three are blickets. But in the given scenario, when 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. Adding 2 made it turn on. Then removing 0 and 1 made it turn off. So maybe the machine requires all three to be on. If that's the case, then all three are blickets. But the question is about object 0. If the machine only turns on when all three are present, then each one is a blicket. So object 0's presence is necessary for the machine to be on. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket. \n\nBut wait, maybe the rule is different. Let's see. Suppose that the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. For example, if 2 is a blicket and either 0 or 1 is a blicket. Wait, in that case, when 0 and 1 are on the machine, but 2 is off, the machine is off. Then putting 2 on makes it on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and at least one of 0 or 1 is also a blicket. But when you take 0 and 1 off, leaving only 2, the machine turns off. So 2 alone isn't enough. Therefore, if 2 is a blicket, and 0 or 1 are also blickets, then the machine would require both 2 and another. For example, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Suppose that 0 is not a blicket, but 1 and 2 are. Then putting 0 and 1 on the machine (without 2) would have the machine off. Adding 2 (which is a blicket) would make two blickets (1 and 2) and the machine turns on. Then removing 0 (which is not a blicket) and 1 (which is a blicket) leaves only 2, which is a blicket, but only one, so the machine turns off. That would fit the observations. In this case, object 0 is not a blicket. But how do we know if the rule is 'at least two blickets' or 'all three are needed'? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But that doesn't fit because putting 2 on alone didn't turn it on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on. Suppose that the blickets are 0 and 2. Then when 0 and 1 are on, the machine is off because 2 is missing. Adding 2 makes all blickets (0 and 2) on, so machine turns on. Then taking off 0 and 1 leaves 2 on, but since 0 is a blicket, the machine turns off because 0 is missing. But in that case, the rule is that all blickets must be on. Then object 0 and 2 are blickets. So in this scenario, object 0 is a blicket. But how do we distinguish between these possibilities?\n\nWait, let's recap the steps. The user put 0 and 1 on the machine, machine remained off. Then put 2 on, machine turned on. Then took 0 and 1 off, leaving 2, machine turned off. So the presence of 2 alone doesn't activate the machine, but 2 plus others (0 and 1) does. So maybe 2 is a necessary component, but not sufficient. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when object 2 is present along with at least one other blicket. But how do we know which ones are blickets?\n\nAlternatively, the machine could be activated if exactly two objects are on, but that doesn't fit because when three were on, it was on. Or maybe the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 is on, regardless of others. But when object 2 was on alone, it didn't activate. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when an even number of objects are on. But 3 is odd, but it activated. No, that's not possible. \n\nWait, when object 0 and 1 were on (two objects), machine was off. Adding 2 (total three) turned it on. Then taking two off (leaving one) turned it off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when three objects are on. If that's the case, then the blickets are none of the objects, because the number of objects is what matters, not their identity. But the problem states that blickets are objects whose presence is not independent of the machine's state. If the machine's state depends only on the count, then all objects are equally blickets because each contributes to the count. But that seems conflicting with the definition. The definition says a blicket is an object whose state (presence on machine) is not independent of the machine's state. So mutual information between the object's presence and the machine's state. If the machine depends on the count, then each object's presence does have mutual information with the machine's state, because adding any object affects the count. Therefore, in that case, all objects are blickets. But in this scenario, when three objects are on, machine is on. Otherwise off. So if that's the rule, then all three are blickets. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket. \n\nBut in the initial steps, putting 0 and 1 on didn't activate the machine (count 2), adding 2 made count 3, which turned it on. Then removing 0 and 1 (count 1) turned it off. So that fits the 'three objects needed' rule. But the problem is, the user is supposed to find which objects are blickets. If the rule is that three objects are needed, then all objects are blickets. But maybe that's not the case. Because the problem says the blicketness is in the objects. So the rule might be different. For example, maybe the machine activates if all blickets are present. Suppose that the blickets are 0,1,2. Then the machine would turn on only when all three are on. Which fits the observations. So in that case, all three are blickets. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket. \n\nBut wait, maybe the blickets are 2 only. Then the machine would turn on when 2 is on. But in the scenario, when only 2 was on, the machine was off. So that's not possible. So 2 alone is not sufficient. Therefore, 2 must be a blicket, but requires another. Let's think. If the rule is that the machine turns on when 2 and at least one other object are on. So 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not. But when 0 and 1 are on, adding 2 (a blicket) makes it turn on. Then taking 0 and 1 off leaves only 2, which would not turn on the machine. So in this case, the machine turns on if 2 and at least one other object are present. Therefore, 2 is a blicket, and the others are not. But how does that explain the machine turning on when all three are on. So 2 plus two non-blickets. The rule would be that 2 must be on, and at least one other object (regardless of whether it's a blicket). But then the presence of other objects affects the machine, but they are not blickets. According to the problem's definition, a blicket is an object whose presence is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state depends on the presence of 2 and another object, then 2's presence is a factor, but the other objects' presence is also a factor. Therefore, mutual information would exist for 2 and the others. Wait, but if the rule is that the machine is on iff object 2 and at least one other are present, then the presence of any other object (like 0 or 1) would have mutual information with the machine's state. Because when 2 is present, the machine's state depends on the presence of another object. So the presence of 0 would have mutual information with the machine's state when 2 is present. Hmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine turns on only when object 2 is on and at least one other object is on. So, 2 is a blicket, and the others are not. But then, the presence of 0 and 1 affects the machine's state only when 2 is present. So the mutual information between 0's presence and the machine's state is zero when 2 is not on. But when 2 is on, 0's presence affects the machine. But the problem states that a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state is dependent on 0's presence when 2 is present, then 0 would have mutual information with the machine's state. Therefore, 0 would be a blicket. But that's not the case here. Because the rule is that the machine is on if 2 is on and at least one other object is on. So 0's presence is only relevant when 2 is on. Therefore, in the case where 2 is not on, 0's presence doesn't affect the machine. But when 2 is on, 0's presence does. Therefore, the mutual information between 0 and the machine's state may not be zero. Thus, 0 would be a blicket. \n\nThis is getting a bit too complicated. Let me try to approach this more systematically. \n\nThe mutual information between an object's presence and the machine's state must be non-zero for it to be a blicket. So, if we can find that the machine's state changes when the object's presence changes, holding other variables constant, then that object is a blicket. \n\nLet's look at the interactions:\n\n1. Put 0 and 1 on machine: machine off.\n2. Put 2 on machine: machine on.\n3. Take 0 and 1 off, leaving 2: machine off.\n\nSo, when 0,1,2 are on: machine on.\nWhen 0 and 1 are on: machine off.\nWhen 2 is on alone: machine off.\n\nSo, the machine is only on when all three are present. Therefore, the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all three objects are on. Therefore, each object's presence is necessary for the machine to be on. Therefore, each object's presence is dependent on the machine's state. Hence, all three are blickets. \n\nTherefore, object 0 is a blicket. So the answer should be True."}
