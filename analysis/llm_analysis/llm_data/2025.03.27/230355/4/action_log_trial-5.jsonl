The goal is to test each object's effect by placing them on the machine and observing the outcome.\n\nBut wait, when I tried to take object 0 off the machine, the response was \"0 is not a recognized object.\" That's confusing.

But maybe the initial response was a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the objects are named differently. Wait, in the initial description, the objects are referred to as \"object 0\", \"object 1\", etc. So the correct command should include the word 'object' before the number. So the previous attempt was wrong because it used '0' instead of 'object 0'. That's probably the issue. So the correct command would be 'take object 0 off machine'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects just the number, but the response said 0 is not recognized. That's conflicting. Let's think again. The initial setup says objects 0, 1, 2. The commands are 'put ... on ...' and 'take ... off ...'. The example given in the problem statement was \"put ... on machine\" or \"take ... off machine\". So maybe the correct way is to refer to the objects as 'object 0', 'object 1', etc. But in the previous attempt, the user used 'take 0 off machine' which the system didn't recognize.

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. So far, I know that initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. Then I took object 0 off, and the light remained off. Then I put object 1 on the machine, and the light was still off. Hmm. So with object 1 alone, the machine didn't activate. Maybe object 1 isn't a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one blicket?\n\nWait, but initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. So maybe object 0 isn't a blicket either. Or maybe the rule isn't just having a single blicket on the machine. Maybe it's a combination. Let's think. What if the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on it? Or when all blickets are on? Or maybe a certain number?\n\nI need to test different combinations. Right now, only object 1 is on the machine. Let's try adding another object. Let's try putting object 2 on the machine along with object 1. If the light turns on, maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, maybe neither, or a different combination.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check each object individually first. Let's see. When object 0 was on the machine alone, light was off. Then when I took it off, still off. Then put object 1 on alone, still off. So maybe neither 0 nor 1 are blickets. Let's try object 2 alone. Let's take object 1 off and put object 2 on.\n\nWait, but maybe the machine requires a specific number or combination. Let's try combinations. So currently, object 1 is on the machine. Let's add object 2. If I put object 2 on the machine, then both 1 and 2 are on. If the light turns on, maybe both are blickets. If not, maybe one of them isn't, or maybe the rule is different. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket, but perhaps none of them are blickets. Hmm. But the problem states that some of the objects are blickets, so there must be at least one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. So if there's one blicket, then putting that one on would activate it. If there are two, then both need to be on. So since putting 0 on initially didn't work, maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Then 1 alone didn't work. So maybe 2 is the only one. Let's test that. Let's take 1 off and put 2 on.\n\nWait, but the user has a limited number of steps. Let's think strategically. The initial setup had object 0 on the machine and light off. So that suggests that object 0 alone isn't sufficient. Then putting 1 alone also didn't work. So maybe the blicket is 2, and the rule is that it needs to be on the machine. Let's try putting 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's a combination.\n\nSo current state: object 0 on floor, object 1 on machine, object 2 on floor. Let's take object 1 off and put object 2 on. But that's two steps. Alternatively, first put object 2 on, so both 1 and 2 are on. Let's see.\n\nBut the machine's light was off when 1 was on alone. If adding 2 makes it turn on, then maybe either 2 is a blicket and 1 is not (so the rule is at least one blicket on), or both are needed. Alternatively, maybe it's an AND condition.\n\nWait, but the problem says blickets are objects whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So the presence of a blicket on the machine affects the machine's state. So mutual information is non-zero. So if a blicket is on the machine, the probability of the machine being on is different than if it's not. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But in that case, when the initial state had object 0 on, the machine was off. So if 0 is not a blicket, then putting a blicket on would turn it on. But when I put 1 on, it didn't. So maybe 1 isn't a blicket. Let's try putting 2 on.\n\nSo next step: put object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then either 2 is a blicket (if the rule is OR), or the combination of 1 and 2. If not, then maybe none of them are, but the problem states some are. Hmm. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the next command would be to put object 2 on the machine. Let's see what happens."}

The goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Right now, after some actions, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, and the light is still off. Object 0 was on the machine initially, but taking it off didn't change the light. Hmm.\n\nWait, when I first entered the room, object 0 was on the machine and the light was off. Then I took it off, and the light stayed off. Then I put object 1 on, still off. Then added object 2, still off. So none of these combinations made the machine light turn on. Maybe I need to test different combinations. Maybe the rule requires a certain number of blickets on the machine. For example, maybe at least one blicket is needed, but maybe the initial objects aren't blickets. Or maybe the rule is more complex, like only specific combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on only when all blickets are on it. If there are multiple blickets, maybe they all need to be present. Let me think. If all three are possible, but initially, only object 0 was on the machine. But that didn't activate it. So maybe object 0 isn't a blicket. Then adding 1 and 2 also didn't work. So maybe none of them are blickets? But that can't be, because the problem states some are blickets. Wait, the problem says \"some of these objects are blickets,\" so at least one. So maybe I need to try different combinations.\n\nLet me try putting object 0 back on the machine. Maybe combining objects. So if I take 1 and 2 off and put 0 on, see if that does anything. Or maybe combinations. For example, if the machine requires exactly two blickets, and the current setup (1 and 2) aren't both blickets. Let me try putting object 0 and 1 on the machine. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to take some objects off. Let's take object 1 and 2 off the machine. But currently, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. So take object 1 off, then take object 2 off. Then put object 0 and 1 on. Wait, but how many steps do I have left? Let me check the commands so far. The initial steps were: take 0 off, put 1 on, put 2 on. Then look. That's four steps. Then the last command was putting 2 on, making five. Now I need to proceed.\n\nSo next step: take object 1 off the machine. But if I take object 1 off, then the machine would have only object 2. But in the current state, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. Wait, no, after the last command, object 2 was put on, so both 1 and 2 are on. So maybe I should take one off and see if the light changes. Wait, the light is off now. If taking one off might not help. Alternatively, maybe adding a third object. But there are only three objects. Let's see, object 0 is on the floor. So maybe put object 0 on the machine with 1 and 2. Let's try that. So the next command would be 'put object 0 on machine'. Let's see what happens. If all three are on the machine, maybe the light turns on. If it does, then maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on, and all three are blickets. But that's just a hypothesis. Alternatively, maybe any single blicket would do, but maybe none of the ones tested so far are blickets. Wait, but the initial state had object 0 on the machine, and the light was off. So if object 0 is a blicket, then maybe the rule is that the machine only turns on when a certain number of blickets are on, but that number isn't met yet. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. So if two of the three are blickets, then putting two on would activate it. But in the current state, 1 and 2 are on, and the light is off. So maybe they are not the right combination. Maybe 0 and 1, or 0 and 2. So perhaps trying combinations of two. Let's try putting 0 and 1 on the machine. To do that, I need to take 1 and 2 off first. So steps: take 1 off, take 2 off, put 0 on, put 1 on. Then check the light. But that's several steps, but maybe necessary. Alternatively, since object 0 was on the machine initially and the light was off, maybe 0 isn't a blicket. So perhaps the blicket is 1 or 2, but their combination isn't right. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if an odd number of blickets are on. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when a specific single blicket is present. For example, maybe object 2 is a blicket, but only when it's the only one on the machine. Wait, but when I put 2 on with 1, nothing happened. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on, and there's only one blicket. For example, if object 1 is the blicket, then putting it on alone would turn on the machine. But when I put 1 on alone, the light was off. So that can't be. Wait, let's recap:\n\nInitial state: 0 on machine, light off. Take 0 off, light remains off. Put 1 on, light off. Put 2 on, light off. So none of these actions made the light turn on. So maybe the rule is more complex. Maybe the machine turns on when a certain combination of objects are on, regardless of being blickets? But no, the problem states that blickets have blicktness that affects the machine. So the rule is based on the presence of blickets. So perhaps the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on, but the current objects on the machine (1 and 2) are not blickets. Then maybe object 0 is the only blicket. But initially, object 0 was on the machine and the light was off. So that would contradict. Unless the rule is different. Maybe the machine only turns on when a blicket is not present. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. So if two of the three are blickets, putting both on would activate it. But in the current state, 1 and 2 are on, and nothing. So maybe they are not the two. Alternatively, maybe 0 and 1 are blickets, so putting them both on would activate. But to test that, I need to take 2 off, put 0 and 1 on. Let's try that. So next steps: take 2 off, then put 0 on. Then check if the light turns on. If it does, maybe 0 and 1 are blickets. But since putting 1 on alone didn't work, maybe the rule requires both. Let's try that. So the next command would be 'take object 2 off machine' to remove one, then put 0 on. Let me see. But in the current state, objects 1 and 2 are on. Taking 2 off leaves 1. Then putting 0 on would have 0 and 1. If that combination triggers the light, then maybe they are the blickets. But that's two steps. Since each step is a command, I need to do each as a separate step. Let's proceed step by step. First, take object 2 off the machine. Then, put object 0 on the machine. Then check. But maybe after taking 2 off, the machine has only object 1, which didn't trigger the light before. Then adding 0, which was on initially and didn't trigger. But maybe together they do. Let's try that. So first command: take object 2 off machine. Then next step, put object 0 on. Then look. Alternatively, after taking 2 off, check if the light is on. Wait, when I took 0 off earlier, the light stayed off. When I put 1 on, then 2 on, light stayed off. So maybe taking 2 off now won't change anything. Let's proceed. \n\nBut first, the current command. The user is in the state where objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, light off. The previous command was putting 2 on, which resulted in light off. The next step should be to take one of them off and try adding another. Let's try taking object 1 off first. Wait, but that's two objects on the machine. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe all three objects need to be on the machine. Since right now, 1 and 2 are on, maybe adding 0 would trigger. So next command: put object 0 on machine. Let's see if that works. So the command would be 'put object 0 on machine'. If the light turns on, then maybe all three are blickets. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on, and 0 is the only blicket. But when 0 was on the machine initially, the light was off. So that contradicts. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I need to test each object individually. Let's try putting each object on the machine alone and see. For example, currently, object 1 is on, and 2 is on. So first, take both off. Take 1 off, take 2 off. Then put 0 on. If the light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. But when 0 was on initially, the light was off. So that wouldn't make sense. Wait, unless the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is added, but not when it's removed. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present, and 0 is not a blicket. Let's think. If I test each object alone. For example:\n\nTest object 0 alone: put 0 on machine. If light is off, then it's not a blicket. If on, it is. But when it was on initially, light was off, so likely not a blicket. \n\nTest object 1 alone: put 1 on. If light on, then 1 is a blicket. But earlier, when I put 1 on, the light stayed off. So maybe not. \n\nTest object 2 alone: put 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. But when I put 2 on with 1, light was off. But maybe 2 is a blicket only when alone. Wait, but the problem states that the machine's state depends on the objects' blicktness. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. So if any of the objects on the machine are blickets, the light is on. But in that case, putting a single blicket should turn it on. But when I put 1 or 2 on, the light didn't turn on. So that suggests that neither 1 nor 2 are blickets. But the problem says some are blickets. Therefore, maybe the rule is different. For example, the machine turns on only if all blickets are on the machine. So if there are two blickets, both must be on. Or maybe it's an XOR scenario: exactly one blicket must be on. Let's suppose there are two blickets. Then, putting either one alone would turn it on, but putting both would turn it off. But that's complicated. Alternatively, the machine turns on if an odd number of blickets are on. So if there's one or three blickets, it's on. But I need to test. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when a specific combination is present, such as object 0 and object 2 together. Or maybe the sum of some property. \n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the initial state had object 0 on the machine, and the light was off. Taking it off didn't change. Putting 1 on and 2 on didn't change. Maybe the blickets are objects that, when removed, turn the machine on. But that seems unlikely. Or maybe the machine is on when no blickets are present. But that would contradict the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is based on the number of blickets. For example, the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are on. If there are two blickets among the three objects, then putting two of them on would activate it. So let's try different pairs. \n\nSo far, putting 1 and 2 on didn't work. Next, try putting 0 and 1. To do that, I need to remove 2 and 1, then put 0 and 1. So steps:\n\n1. Take object 2 off machine. \n2. Take object 1 off machine. \n3. Put object 0 on machine. \n4. Put object 1 on machine. \n\nBut that's four steps, and I'm limited in steps. Alternatively, perhaps first take 2 off, then put 0 on. So current state: 1 and 2 on. Take 2 off, then put 0 on. Now machine has 1 and 0. Check light. If it turns on, then 0 and 1 are blickets. Let's try that. \n\nSo next command: take object 2 off machine. Then, next step put object 0 on. \n\nBut let's proceed step by step. The next command should be taking object 2 off. Let's do that. Then, put 0 on. \n\nBut first, the current command: after putting object 2 on, the light is off. So the next step would be to take object 2 off. Let's see if that does anything. \n\nCommand: take object 2 off machine. \n\nIf after removing 2, the machine has only object 1. The light was off when 1 was alone before. So taking 2 off wouldn't change. Then put object 0 on. Now machine has 0 and 1. If the light turns on, then 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, then maybe 0 and 2. Or another combination. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a certain single blicket is on. But none of the individual objects activated it. So perhaps the rule is more complex. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is activated when a blicket is on the floor, not on the machine. But that would be counterintuitive. The problem says blicketness makes the machine turn on when on the machine. So that's unlikely. \n\nAnother approach: try to find the minimal set that activates the machine. Currently, with 1 and 2 on, no light. Maybe add 0 to the machine. If all three are on, maybe that works. Let's try that. \n\nCommand: put object 0 on machine. \n\nIf the light turns on, then maybe all three are blickets. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly three blickets. But if that's the case, putting all three on would turn it on. Let's try. \n\nSo next command: put object 0 on machine. \n\nIf the light turns on, then all three are blickets. If not, then maybe another combination. \n\nAfter putting 0 on, the machine has 0, 1, 2. Let's see. If the light turns on, then the rule might be that all blickets are on the machine. If there are three blickets, then that's the case. But if the light doesn't turn on, then maybe none of them are blickets, but that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are on. Or some other function. \n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's recap the possible scenarios:\n\n- The initial state had object 0 on the machine, light off. Taking 0 off, light remains off. So 0 alone isn't a blicket (if the rule is that a single blicket activates it). \n\n- Putting 1 on alone: light off. So 1 isn't a single blicket. \n\n- Putting 2 on (after 1 was on): light off. So 2 alone (when added to 1) doesn't activate. \n\n- Putting 0, 1, and 2 on: maybe activates. \n\nIf after putting 0 on the machine, the light turns on, then perhaps the combination of 0, 1, and 2 includes the necessary blickets. But if the light doesn't turn on, then perhaps the blickets are not present. But according to the problem, some are blickets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on only when a certain specific combination is present, like 0 and 2. \n\nAnother possibility: the machine is activated by the absence of a blicket. For example, if a blicket is removed, the machine turns on. But that's the opposite of the problem description. \n\nAlternatively, the machine requires a specific order of placement. But that's probably not the case. \n\nLet's proceed with the next command. Since the user has tried putting 1 and 2 on the machine with no luck, the next logical step is to try adding object 0 to the machine to see if all three being on activates it. So the next command would be 'put object 0 on machine'."}

So, the goal is to find out which objects are blickets and determine the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, here's what happened:\n\nInitially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. When I took object 0 off, the light stayed off. Then I put object 1 on the machine, and the light remained off. Then I added object 2, still off. Finally, when I put object 0 back on, the light turned on. Now all three objects are on the machine, and the light is on.\n\nHmm. So when all three are on the machine, it's on. But maybe it's not about all three. Let's see. Before adding object 0, objects 1 and 2 were on the machine, but the light was off. Adding object 0 made it turn on. So perhaps object 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. But wait, when object 0 was alone on the machine initially, the light was off. Wait, no, the first step was that object 0 was on the machine at the start. The initial state had object 0 on the machine, and the light was off. Then taking it off and putting it back on made the light turn on. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, initial state: object 0 on machine, light off. Then I took object 0 off, light still off. Then put object 1 on machine, light off. Then put 2 on, light off. Then put 0 on, light turned on. So with all three on, it's on. But when only 0 was on initially, it was off. So maybe the rule requires all blickets to be on the machine. Or maybe the machine turns on when a specific combination is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine requires exactly object 0 to be on it. But in the initial state, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. That contradicts that. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are on it. Let's suppose object 0 is a blicket. When only 0 is on, light is off. Then when adding non-blickets 1 and 2, then adding 0 again (so total one blicket), but now all three are on. Wait, maybe the machine requires at least two blickets. But if 0 is a blicket and 1 and 2 are not, then in the final state, only 0 is a blicket, so that wouldn't explain it. Alternatively, maybe objects 0 and 1 are blickets. Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at each step's effect.\n\n1. Start: 0 on machine, light off. So if 0 is a blicket, but the machine is off. So the rule can't be \"presence of any blicket\". Because in that case, with 0 on, the light should be on.\n\n2. Took 0 off: light off. Then put 1 on: light off. So 1 alone doesn't activate.\n\n3. Put 2 on: light still off. So 1 and 2 together don't activate.\n\n4. Put 0 on: now all three on, light on. So adding 0 to 1 and 2 makes it activate. So perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are present. If 0 is the only blicket, then when it's on the machine alone, the light should be on, but initially it wasn't. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. Suppose objects 0 and 1 are blickets. When 0 and 1 are on (after putting 1 on and 0 back), but initially 0 was on alone, which didn't activate. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket and some other condition. For example, maybe the machine turns on when a blicket is placed on it after another object is already there. Or maybe a certain combination of objects. Let's see.\n\nAnother angle: When all three are on, the machine is on. But when only 0 was on, it was off. When 1 and 2 were on, it was off. So maybe the presence of all three objects activates it. But that would mean none are blickets, but the problem states that blickets are the ones whose presence affects the machine. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the sum of blicktness is above a threshold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when any blicket is on the machine, but only if it's the only one. But when 0 was alone initially, it was off. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the initial state had object 0 on the machine, but the machine was off. Then taking it off and putting it back on made the machine turn on. But that seems inconsistent unless there's a timing factor, but the problem states that the light changes immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's state depends on the order of placement. For example, the last object added was 0, and that's when it turned on. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when a specific object is placed on it, regardless of others. But when 0 was added last, maybe that's the trigger. But why did it turn on then?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Suppose objects 0 and 2 are blickets. Then when 0 and 2 are on, the machine turns on. Let's see:\n\n- Initially, 0 is on, light off. So if 0 is a blicket, but maybe needs another. Then when I added 2 (a blicket), but 1 was already on. So 0,1,2: but if 0 and 2 are blickets, then two blickets are on. Maybe the rule is two or more blickets. So that would make sense. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn the initial state, 0 is on. If 0 is a blicket, but alone, machine off. Then after adding 1 (non-blicket) and 2 (blicket), now two blickets (0 and 2) on the machine. But according to the steps, after adding 2, the light was still off. Then adding 0 again (but it was already on? Wait, no. Wait, let's retrace:\n\nAfter taking 0 off, then putting 1 on (light off), then putting 2 on (light off), then putting 0 on. Now all three are on. So if 0 and 2 are blickets, then when adding 0 to 1 and 2, the machine now has two blickets (0 and 2), so the light turns on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, the machine was off. So the rule could be that two or more blickets are needed. Then in that case, objects 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\nBut why did the machine not turn on when 0 was alone initially? Because maybe the rule requires exactly two. Wait, no. If the rule is \"exactly two\", then in the final step, having three objects (0,1,2) with two blickets (0 and 2), that would satisfy the rule. But when only 0 was on, it's one blicket, so machine off. When 0 is added again to 1 and 2, which includes 2 (another blicket), now two blickets, so machine on. That fits.\n\nBut how do we know if 2 is a blicket? Because when I put 2 on the machine along with 1, but without 0, the machine stayed off. So if 2 is a blicket, but 1 is not, then putting 2 and 1 (non-blicket) would only have one blicket (2), which is less than two. So the machine stays off. Then adding 0 (another blicket) gives two, so machine turns on. So that would fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0 and 1 are blickets. Let's test that. If 0 and 1 are blickets, then when 0 is alone (initially), machine off. Then adding 1 gives two blickets, but according to the steps, after putting 1 on (with 0 off), the machine was off. Wait, no. Wait, after taking 0 off, 1 is put on, but that's only one blicket (assuming 1 is a blicket). If the rule is two blickets, then putting 1 alone (if it's a blicket) would be one, so machine off. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) and then 0 (blicket) would make two (1 and 0), so machine on. That also fits. But how to distinguish between these possibilities.\n\nWait, but when I put 1 on the machine (after removing 0), the light was off. If 1 is a blicket, and the rule is two blickets, then adding 1 alone wouldn't do it. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) and then 0 (blicket) gives two (0 and 1), so machine on. That works. So possible that 0 and 1 are blickets, needing two.\n\nBut how to determine which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if the majority of the objects on it are blickets. If there are three objects on the machine, and two are blickets, then majority (2/3). But in that case, if two are blickets, machine on. But then when 0 and 1 are blickets, and they are two out of three, machine on. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on only when all blickets are on it. Suppose there's one blicket (object 0). Then putting it on the machine should activate. But in the initial state, 0 was on, but machine off. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's state changes only when you add or remove an object, but the initial state might have been a setup. Let's re-examine the steps:\n\nInitial state: object 0 on machine, light off. So if the rule is that having object 0 on the machine activates it, then the initial state contradicts that. Therefore, maybe the rule is more complex. Like, the machine turns on when object 0 is placed on the machine after another object. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's activation depends on the presence of object 0 and at least one other object. So when 0 is alone, it's off. But when 0 is on with others, it's on. That would fit the observations. So when I put 0 back on with 1 and 2 already on, the machine turns on. If the rule is that the machine needs object 0 and at least one other object, then that explains it. In that case, object 0 is a blicket, and the others aren't. But then, the machine's state depends on object 0's presence along with others. But the problem states that a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state depends on object 0's presence in combination with others, then object 0's state is not independent (since when it's on with others, machine is on; when it's off, machine is off, etc.), so mutual information exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is on, regardless of others. But in the initial state, object 0 was on and the machine was off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to test further. Let's try removing objects one by one to see when the machine turns off.\n\nCurrently, all three are on the machine, light is on. Suppose I take object 1 off. If the machine stays on, that suggests that 1 isn't a blicket. If it turns off, then 1 might be a blicket.\n\nBut I need to use the available commands. Let me think of possible next steps.\n\nCurrent state: all three objects on machine, light on.\n\nIf I take object 1 off the machine, and the light stays on, then 1 isn't a blicket. If it turns off, then 1 is a blicket. Similarly for others.\n\nSo possible commands:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nIf after that, the light stays on, then 1 isn't a blicket. Then take object 2 off. If light stays on, then 0 is the only blicket, and the rule is that when 0 is on, the machine is on. But initial state contradicts that. Wait, but in the initial state, 0 was on and machine off. So that's conflicting. Unless the rule is that the machine is on only when 0 is placed after another object. Maybe the order matters. For example, the machine turns on when 0 is placed on top of another object. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that 0 is the only object on it. But when 0 was alone initially, the machine was off. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when 0 and 2 are on together. Let's say 0 and 2 are blickets. So when both are on, machine is on. Let's see:\n\nIn the final step, all three are on (0,1,2). If taking 1 off (leaving 0 and 2), machine stays on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 2), machine turns off. Then putting 0 back on (now 0 and 2), machine on. That would confirm that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both need to be present.\n\nBut I need to test this. But since I can't actually perform these steps here, I have to infer from previous steps.\n\nAnother observation: When only 0 was on the machine initially, the light was off. When I put 1 and 2 on, then added 0, the light turned on. So maybe the machine requires 0 and at least one other object. So the rule is \"0 must be present along with at least one other object\". In this case, 0 is a blicket because its presence affects the machine when combined with others. The other objects aren't blickets because their presence alone doesn't affect the machine. But how does mutual information work here? The machine's state depends on 0 being present with others, so 0's state is not independent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on, and one of them is a blicket. But in this case, when 0 and 1 were on (after putting 1 and then 0), but that's not what happened.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when the number of blickets is odd. For example, if 0 is a blicket, then when it's on the machine (alone: odd 1), machine on. But in the initial state, it was off. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me summarize the observations:\n\n- Initial state: 0 on machine, light off. So 0 alone doesn't activate.\n- After removing 0, adding 1 and 2: light off.\n- Adding 0 again (all three on): light on.\n\nPossible rules:\n\n1. The machine turns on when all three objects are on it. But the problem states that some are blickets. If the rule is all three, then none are blickets, which contradicts the problem's premise. So this is unlikely.\n\n2. The machine turns on when a specific combination is present. For example, 0 and 1, or 0 and 2, etc.\n\n3. The machine requires at least two blickets. Suppose objects 0 and 2 are blickets. Then when both are on, the machine is on. But when 0 was alone initially, it was off. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) doesn't help. Wait, no. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then having both on would trigger the machine. But initially, only 0 was on, so machine off. Then when adding 2 (blicket) to 1 (non), but 0 was off. Wait, no. Let's retrace:\n\nAfter taking 0 off, 1 and 2 are on. Then adding 0 makes all three on. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then two blickets are present. If the rule is two or more, then machine on. But when 0 was alone initially, machine off. So that fits. So in this case, objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that at least two blickets must be on the machine.\n\nBut how to confirm? If I take 2 off now, leaving 0 and 1 on, and the machine stays on (if 0 is a blicket and 1 isn't), but according to the rule requiring two blickets, removing 2 (a blicket) would leave only 0 (a blicket), which is one, so machine should turn off. If that happens, then the rule is two or more. But since I can't actually perform that step, I have to infer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is present along with any other object. So 0 must be on, and at least one other. Then, in the initial state, 0 was alone, so off. After adding 1 and 2, then adding 0 (but 0 was already on?), no. Wait, no. Let me retrace the steps again:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. Start: 0 on machine, light off.\n\n2. Take 0 off: machine off.\n\n3. Put 1 on: machine off.\n\n4. Put 2 on: machine off.\n\n5. Put 0 on: now all three on, machine on.\n\nSo in step 5, adding 0 to 1 and 2 turns it on. So if the rule is that 0 must be present with at least one other, then that would explain. Because in step 1, 0 was alone (off). In step 5, 0 is with 1 and 2 (on). So 0's presence with others activates the machine. So the rule is \"machine on if object 0 is on the machine and there's at least one other object on it\". In this case, object 0 is the only blicket, because the machine's state depends on 0's presence in combination with others. The mutual information between 0's state and the machine's state is non-zero because the machine's state changes when 0 is added or removed in the presence of others.\n\nBut then why didn't the machine turn on when 0 was added back? Because after step 4, 1 and 2 are on. Then adding 0 (step 5), so now 0,1,2 are on. So the machine turns on because 0 is present with others. But if the rule is that 0 must be present with others, then whenever 0 is on with others, the machine is on. If 0 is alone, it's off.\n\nSo in this scenario, object 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is on the machine along with at least one other object.\n\nThat fits the observations. Let's check:\n\n- Initial: 0 alone \u2192 off. Rule requires 0 plus others.\n\n- After step 5: 0 plus 1 and 2 \u2192 on.\n\n- If I remove 1 and 2, leaving 0 alone \u2192 machine turns off.\n\n- If I have 0 and 1 \u2192 machine on.\n\nSo yes, this seems to fit.\n\nTherefore, the blicket is object 0, and the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is on the machine along with at least one other object."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Let's recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. When I took object 0 off the machine, the light stayed off. Then I put object 1 on the machine\u2014still off. Then object 2\u2014still off. But when I added object 0 back on, the light turned on. So all three objects were on the machine, and the light was on. Then when I removed object 1, the light turned off again. \n\nHmm. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, but maybe the rule requires multiple blickets? Let me think. When only object 0 was on the machine (after removing 1 and 2), the light was on. Wait, no\u2014when I first took object 0 off, the machine was off. Then putting 0 back on with 1 and 2 made it turn on. Wait, no, the initial state had object 0 on the machine, and the light was off. Then when I took 0 off, the light stayed off. Then I added 1 and 2, and then 0 again, and the light turned on. Wait, maybe the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. But if 0 is a blicket, then having just 0 on the machine should turn it on. But in the initial state, object 0 was on the machine alone, and the light was off. So that contradicts that. Unless there's another rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. But when object 0 was on the machine alone initially, the light was off. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets, or some combination. Let's see.\n\nLet me list the steps again step by step:\n\n1. Start: Objects 0 on machine, 1 and 2 on floor. Light is off.\n2. Take 0 off: Light remains off.\n3. Put 1 on machine: Light off.\n4. Put 2 on machine: Light off.\n5. Put 0 on machine (now all three on): Light turns on.\n6. Remove 1: Light turns off.\n\nSo when all three are on, light is on. When 1 is removed (leaving 0 and 2 on), light turns off. So maybe the presence of 0 and 2 together is required? But then why did the light turn on when all three were on. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. Let's test.\n\nWait, after putting 0 back on when 1 and 2 were already on, the light turned on. Then removing 1 (so 0 and 2 are left) caused the light to turn off. So when 0 and 2 are on, the light is off. But when 0,1,2 are on, it's on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are on. But that seems unlikely because maybe only some of them are blickets. Wait, but the initial state had only 0 on, and the light was off. Then when all three were on, light on. Then removing 1 (so 0 and 2 on) made it off. So maybe the rule is that all three must be on. But that would mean none are blickets, since the machine's state depends on all objects. But according to the problem, a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state depends on the combination of objects, then all involved objects would be blickets. But that might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two specific objects are on it. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when object 0 is present along with any other object. Because when 0 was on with 1 and 2, it was on. When 0 and 2 were on, but after removing 1, the light turned off. Wait, no\u2014when we removed 1, the light turned off even though 0 and 2 were still on. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, let's reconstruct the steps again carefully. After putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light was on. Then taking 1 off made the light go off. So the light was on with all three, then off with 0 and 2. So perhaps the machine requires all three to be on. But then all three are blickets. But in the initial state, only 0 was on, and the light was off. So if all three are required, then none are blickets. Wait, that can't be. Because the machine's state depends on the combination. But according to the problem, a blicket is an object whose presence affects the machine's state. So if the machine's state is determined by the combination, then each object's presence is part of the rule. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when object 0 is present along with at least one other object. Let's test that. In the initial state, only 0 was on\u2014light off. Then when 0 was added to 1 and 2 (so all three on), light on. Then removing 1 leaves 0 and 2\u2014if the rule is that 0 plus at least one other, then the light should stay on. But in reality, it turned off. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on when object 0 and object 2 are both on. Let's see. When all three were on (including 0 and 2), the light was on. Then removing 1 leaves 0 and 2 on, but the light went off. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires exactly two specific objects. Let's see. When 0 and 1 are on, light off. When 0 and 2 are on, light off. When 1 and 2 are on, light off. When all three are on, light on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are present. But then all three would be blickets. But in the problem statement, the blicket is an object that is not independent of the machine's state. If the machine's state is dependent on all three, then all three are blickets. But that seems possible. But how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be present, but the initial state had 0 on, and the light was off. So that's a problem. Unless 0 isn't a blicket, but when combined with others, it is.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are on it. Let's suppose objects 0 and 1 are blickets. Then having both on would turn the machine on. But in the case where 0 was on initially, the light was off. Then when 1 and 2 were added, and 0 was put back, the light turned on. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to test more combinations.\n\nCurrently, after the last step, the machine has objects 0 and 2 on it, and the light is off. Let me check what happens if I remove object 2. So take 2 off, leaving only 0 on. If the light stays off, then that would suggest that 0 alone isn't enough. Then, if I add 1 again, putting 0 and 1 on, does the light turn on?\n\nBut I need to plan the next command. The user just took object 1 off, so now the machine has 0 and 2. The light is off. Let me try removing 2 now to see if 0 alone is on. If the light is still off, then 0 alone isn't a blicket. Then, maybe adding 1 again would help. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. So perhaps 0 and 2 are blickets, but when both are on, the machine is on. Wait, but in the current state, 0 and 2 are on, and the light is off. So that can't be. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all blickets are on the machine. Suppose there's only one blicket, say object 0. Then when it's on, the machine should be on. But initially, object 0 was on, and the machine was off. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, object 0 isn't a blicket by itself. But when all three were on, the machine was on. So perhaps all three are required. But that would mean all three are blickets, but when any of them is missing, the machine is off. So the rule is that the machine turns on only when all three are present. But the problem states that blickets are the ones whose presence is not independent. So if the machine's state depends on all three, then all three are blickets. But maybe that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. But that's just speculation. Let's think of possible experiments.\n\nRight now, the machine has 0 and 2 on it, light is off. If I take 2 off, leaving 0, and the light stays off. Then, if I put 1 back on, making 0 and 1 on, and the light remains off. Then put 2 back on, making all three, and the light turns on again. That would suggest that all three are needed. Thus, the rule is that all three must be on. Therefore, all three are blickets. But wait, in the problem statement, it says that some of the objects are blickets, not necessarily all. So maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If all three are blickets, then the rule is that all must be on. But when I removed 1, leaving 0 and 2, the machine turned off. So if all three are blickets, then that's the rule. But how do I confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only two are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. For example, 0 and 1. Then, when both are on, the machine is on. But in the initial state, 0 was on alone, and the machine was off. Then when all three were on, including 0 and 1, the machine was on. But when 1 was removed, leaving 0 and 2, the machine turned off. But 2 isn't a blicket, so the presence of 0 alone wouldn't activate it. But this requires that 0 and 1 are both needed. But when they were both on the machine (along with 2), the machine was on. But when 1 was removed, even though 0 was still on, the machine turned off. So that would fit if 0 and 1 are blickets and both are required. But then, when 0 and 1 are both on, the machine should be on. But when they were on with 2, it was on. But when 1 was removed, machine off. But what if I put 0 and 1 on without 2? If that turns the machine on, then that would confirm. Let me try that.\n\nSo the next step is to remove object 2 from the machine (since it's currently on), then check the light. Then add 1 again to see if 0 and 1 together turn it on.\n\nBut how many steps do I have left? Let's see, the initial steps were:\n\n1. take 0 off\n2. put 1 on\n3. put 2 on\n4. put 0 on\n5. look (x3)\n6. take 1 off\n\nThat's 8 steps so far. So I have 24 steps left. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, take object 2 off the machine. Then check the status. Then put object 1 back on. Then see if the light turns on.\n\nBut let's do that step by step.\n\nNext command: take object 2 off machine."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets are objects that have a non-independent relationship with the machine's state.\n\nFrom the initial setup, object 0 was on the machine, and the machine was off. Then when I took object 0 off and put 1 and 2 on, the machine stayed off. But when I added object 0 back on the machine, it turned on. Then when all three were on, the light stayed on. Then removing 1 and 2 turned it off again. Wait, but when I took 1 and 2 off, only 0 was left on the machine, right? Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, the initial state was object 0 on the machine, others on the floor. Machine was off. Then after taking 0 off, putting 1 and 2 on, machine still off. Then putting 0 on made it turn on. So when all three were on, machine was on. Then when I took 1 and 2 off, leaving 0 on the machine, the light turned off. Wait, but in the steps, after putting all three on, the machine was on. Then when I took 1 off, the light went off. Then taking 2 off, the light was still off. But when I took 1 and 2 off, only 0 was left on the machine. Wait, but according to the logs:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on machine, the light is on. Then taking 1 off, the light turns off. Then taking 2 off, light stays off. So when only 0 is on the machine, the light is off. But when all three are on, it's on. Wait, but earlier when 0 was put on with 1 and 2 already there, the light turned on. So maybe the presence of object 0 is necessary, but not sufficient on its own. So maybe the machine turns on when object 0 is on it, regardless of others? But when 0 was alone initially, the machine was off. Wait, no. Initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the machine was off. Then when I took 0 off, the machine remained off. Then putting 1 and 2 on didn't turn it on. Then putting 0 on again turned it on. So when 0 is present with 1 and 2, it's on. But when 0 is alone, maybe not. Wait, no. Wait, after putting 0 on the machine again (when 1 and 2 were already on), the light turned on. So that's when 0 was added to 1 and 2. Then all three are on. Then removing 1 and 2 leaves 0 on the machine, but the light is off. So that suggests that 0 alone isn't enough. But when all three are on, it works. So maybe the rule is that all three need to be on? But that can't be, because maybe some combination. Let me think again.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitial state: 0 on machine, 1 and 2 on floor. Machine off.\n\nAfter taking 0 off machine: 0 on floor, others on floor. Machine off.\n\nPut 1 on machine: 1 on machine, others on floor. Machine off.\n\nPut 2 on machine: 1 and 2 on machine. Machine off.\n\nPut 0 on machine: All three on machine. Machine turns on.\n\nThen, after taking 1 off machine: 0 and 2 on machine. Machine turns off.\n\nTaking 2 off: Only 0 on machine. Machine remains off.\n\nSo when only 0 is on the machine, it's off. When 0,1,2 are all on, it's on. But wait, what about other combinations?\n\nWait, when 0 and 1 are on the machine, is it on? Let's check. After putting 0 on machine (with 1 and 2 already there), the machine turned on. Then taking 1 off leaves 0 and 2 on. Machine turns off. So that combination (0 and 2) doesn't work. Similarly, taking 2 off leaves 0 and 1 on. Let me test that. But in the current state, after taking 1 and 2 off, only 0 is left. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. But which are the blickets?\n\nWait, the machine turned on when all three were on. Then when removing 1 and 2, leaving 0, it turned off. So perhaps object 0 is a blicket, but needs another blicket to be present. Or maybe object 0 isn't a blicket, but 1 and 2 are? Wait, but when 1 and 2 were on the machine, the machine was off. Adding 0 made it turn on. So perhaps 0 is a blicket, and 1 and 2 are not. But why did the machine turn on when all three were on? Because 0 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. But when 0 was on the machine initially, the machine was off. So that contradicts that. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. But when 0 was alone initially, the machine was off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when there's an odd number of blickets on it. Let's suppose 0 is a blicket. Then when 0 is alone (initial state), machine is off. Then when 0 is added again with 1 and 2 (non-blickets), the machine has 1 blicket (odd) so it turns on. Then removing 1 (non), leaves 0 and 2 (still 1 blicket, odd). But in the step where after removing 1, the machine turned off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on it. Suppose that all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be on. Then when all three are on, it's on. But in the initial state, object 0 was on, and 1 and 2 were off. So machine was off. But if all three are blickets, then the machine should only turn on when all are on. But when they were all on, the machine was on. But when only 0 was on, it's off. That fits. So maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Then the blickets are 0,1,2. But when I put 1 and 2 on the machine (without 0), the machine was off. Then adding 0 made it turn on. So that supports the idea that all three are blickets. But then in the initial state, only 0 was on, and the machine was off. So that fits the rule. So if all three are blickets and the rule is that all must be on, then yes. But maybe that's the case. However, the problem says \"some of these objects are blickets\". So maybe not all. So perhaps 0 is a blicket, and 1 and 2 are not, but the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on. But then in the initial state, 0 was on, machine was off. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the initial state, object 0 was on the machine, but the machine was off. Then after taking it off and putting 1 and 2 on, machine still off. Then adding 0 back made it turn on. So the presence of 0 seems to be the trigger. But when 0 is alone, machine is off. But when 0 is on with others, it's on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when 0 is present along with at least one other object. But then in that case, 0 is a blicket, and the others are not. Because their presence is necessary but they are not blickets. But according to the definition, a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state depends on whether 0 is present along with others, then 0's presence is correlated. But maybe 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires both. Let's see: When 0 and 1 are on, does the machine turn on? In the steps, after putting 0 on machine (with 1 and 2 already there), the machine turned on. Then taking 1 off (leaving 0 and 2) turned it off. So if 0 and 1 were required, then when 1 is off, even with 0 on, the machine is off. That would fit. But then when all three are on, machine is on, which is okay. But if the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on, then 2 is not a blicket. So the blickets would be 0 and 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are on. Suppose 0 and 1 are blickets. Then when 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. But when 0 and 2 are on (assuming 2 is not a blicket), machine is off. But in the steps, after adding 0,1,2, the machine was on. Then removing 1 and 2 leaves 0 on, machine off. If 0 is a blicket and 1 is a blicket, then having 0 alone (only one blicket) would not turn it on. So the rule might be that the machine requires at least two blickets. But how do we confirm that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires exactly one blicket. If 0 is the only blicket, then when 0 is on the machine, the machine should be on. But in the initial state, 0 was on and the machine was off. So that contradicts that. So that can't be.\n\nAnother possibility: The machine turns on if and only if exactly object 0 is on. But in the initial state, object 0 was on, and machine was off. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's state is determined by the presence of object 0, but only when another object is also present. For example, object 0 is a blicket, and any other object. So the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 and at least one other object are on it. Then, when 0 is alone, machine is off. When 0 is with 1 or 2, machine is on. Let's see:\n\nIn the steps, when 1 and 2 were on, machine was off. Then adding 0 (so 0,1,2 on) turned it on. Then removing 1 and 2 leaves 0 alone, machine off. Then if I put, say, 1 back on, with 0, the machine should turn on. Let me try that. But I need to test this.\n\nBut according to the steps I have, after removing 1 and 2, only 0 is left on the machine. So now, if I put 1 on the machine again, the machine should turn on if the rule is that 0 and any other object are present. So the next step would be to put 1 on the machine again and see if it turns on.\n\nBut the user's next command should be to do that. So, let's see. The last action was taking object 2 off the machine, leaving object 0 on the machine. Then, putting object 1 on the machine would result in 0 and 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, that would support the rule that 0 plus another object (any) turns it on. If it doesn't, then perhaps another rule.\n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. So in the current state, after the last step, objects 0 is on the machine, 1 and 2 are on the floor. The machine is off. The user needs to test more combinations.\n\nSo possible next steps:\n\nPut object 1 on machine (so 0 and 1 are on). If machine turns on, then the rule could be that 0 and at least one other object must be present. If it doesn't, then maybe 0 and 2 must be present. Or another combination.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that exactly object 0 and object 1 must be on. But in that case, putting 0 and 1 on would turn it on, but earlier when all three were on, it was on, which would fit if the rule is that at least 0 and 1 are present.\n\nBut let's proceed. The user's next command should be to test this. For example:\n\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nIf the machine turns on, then maybe the presence of 0 and 1 is required. Then take 1 off, and put 2 on to see if it works with 0 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, if putting 1 on with 0 turns it on, then the rule might be that 0 and any other object (1 or 2) must be present. So the blickets would be 0, 1, and 2, but the rule is that at least two are on. Or 0 is a blicket and the others are not, but the machine requires 0 plus any other.\n\nBut let's simulate the next step. If the user puts 1 on the machine now (with 0 already on), the machine's light would turn on if the rule is that 0 and 1 are required. But based on previous steps, when 0 and 2 were on, the machine was off. Wait, no. After putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light was on. Then taking 1 off (leaving 0 and 2) turned it off. So that suggests that 0 and 2 alone are not sufficient. So maybe the rule is that 0 and 1 must be on, but 2 is irrelevant. But that doesn't fit, because when all three were on, it was on, but when 0 and 1 are on, maybe it's on. But in the current state, the user hasn't tested that yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. Suppose 0 and 1 are blickets. Then when both are on, machine is on. But when all three are on, maybe it's still on. But in the earlier step, when all three were on (0,1,2), the machine was on. Then removing 1 (leaving 0 and 2) turned it off. So if 2 is not a blicket, then having 0 and 2 (only one blicket) would turn it off. That would fit if the rule is that at least two blickets are needed, and 0 and 1 are blickets. But then when both 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. Let's test that.\n\nSo the user should now put 1 on the machine again. Let's see.\n\nBut the user's next command is to be determined. They need to find out if putting 1 back on with 0 will turn it on.\n\nSo possible command:\n\nput object 1 on machine\n\nIf the machine turns on, then that suggests that 0 and 1 together activate it. If not, maybe another combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's rule is that object 0 is a blicket, and the machine turns on only when object 0 is on the machine alone. But that's not possible because initially, object 0 was on the machine and the light was off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires object 0 and both 1 and 2 to be on. So when all three are on, it's on. But when any are missing, it's off. But when the user added 0 to 1 and 2, the machine turned on, but when 0 was alone (initially), it was off. Then when all three were on, it was on. Then removing 1 and 2, leaving 0, it's off. So that fits. But the question is, are all three blickets, or is 0 the only one? If all three are blickets, then the rule is that all must be on. But in that case, when all are on, machine is on. But when any are missing, it's off. So that would mean all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be on.\n\nBut why did the machine turn on when 0 was added to 1 and 2, but not when 0 was alone? Because the rule requires all three. So initial state had only 0, so machine off. Then adding 1 and 2 (but machine was off), then adding 0 again (but 0 was already on? Wait, no. Wait, initial state: object 0 was on the machine. Then the user took it off, put 1 and 2 on. Then put 0 on again. So all three were on. Machine turned on. So that fits the rule that all three must be on. So all three are blickets. But in that case, the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all blickets are on it. So the blickets are 0,1,2. But the initial state had 0 on the machine, but the machine was off. Because 1 and 2 were not on. So that fits. Then when all three are on, machine is on. When any are missing, it's off. So that's possible.\n\nBut then, when the user took 1 off, leaving 0 and 2 on, machine turned off. Which fits. So the rule would be that all three must be on the machine. Therefore, all three are blickets. But the problem states that \"some\" are blickets, not necessarily all. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut let's check another possibility. Suppose that the machine requires exactly one blicket to be on, and that blicket is object 0. But in the initial state, 0 was on and the machine was off. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are on. Suppose 0 and 1 are blickets. Then having both on would be even (two), machine on. But when 0 alone is on (odd), machine off. When all three (assuming 2 is not a blicket), two blickets (0 and 1), machine on. Then removing 1 leaves 0 and 2, so one blicket (0), machine off. That fits. But in this scenario, when 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. But in the steps, when the user added 0 to 1 and 2 (already on), the machine turned on. So that would fit. But in this case, the blickets would be 0 and 1, and the rule is even number of blickets. But how to test that.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested putting 0 and 1 on without 2. So in the current state, 0 is on the machine, 1 and 2 are off. If the user puts 1 on, making 0 and 1 on, and the machine turns on, that would support this even number idea. But if the machine turns on, then it's possible. However, according to the previous steps, when all three were on (0,1,2) and then 1 was removed, leaving 0 and 2, the machine turned off. If 2 is not a blicket, then 0 is the only blicket, so odd number (1), machine off. If 0 and 1 are blickets, then 0 and 1 on would be two, machine on. But in this case, after putting 1 on with 0, the machine should turn on. But I need to check.\n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step would be to test that.\n\nSo the user's next command should be to put object 1 on the machine again, to see if with 0 and 1 on, the machine turns on.\n\nIf they do that and the machine turns on, then the rule could be that two blickets (0 and 1) are needed. Then, taking 1 off again, leaving 0, would turn it off. Then put 2 on with 0, and see if it turns on. If it doesn't, then 2 is not a blicket, and the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be present.\n\nAlternatively, if putting 1 on with 0 turns it on, but putting 2 on with 0 doesn't, then 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. But when all three are on, the machine is on (since both 0 and 1 are present). Then removing 1 turns it off, which fits.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's summarize what's been observed:\n\n- Initial state: 0 on, others off. Machine off.\n\n- Take 0 off: machine off.\n\n- Put 1 and 2 on: machine off.\n\n- Put 0 on: all three on. Machine on.\n\n- Remove 1: 0 and 2 on. Machine off.\n\n- Remove 2: 0 alone. Machine off.\n\nSo the only time the machine was on was when all three were on.\n\nBut according to this, the machine only turns on when all three are present. So the rule would be that all three are blickets and must be on the machine. Therefore, all three are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all blickets are on it.\n\nBut the initial state had 0 on, but the machine was off. Because 1 and 2 were not on. So that fits. Then when all three are on, machine on. When any are missing, off. So that's the rule.\n\nBut the problem says \"some\" objects are blickets. So maybe all three are considered blickets. Then the rule is that all must be on the machine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is even. But this seems less likely given the observations.\n\nGiven the current information, the only time the machine turned on was when all three were on. So it's possible that all three are blickets and the rule is all must be present.\n\nBut another possibility is that object 0 is a blicket, and the machine requires it to be on along with at least one other object. But when 0 is on with 1 and 2, it's on. When 0 is alone, off. When 0 is with 1, on. But we haven't tested that yet.\n\nSo to test that, the user should put 1 back on the machine with 0. If the machine turns on, then the rule could be that 0 and any other object must be present. If it doesn't, then the rule might require all three.\n\nIn the current state, after taking 1 and 2 off, leaving 0 on, the machine is off. So putting 1 on now would result in 0 and 1 on. If that turns the machine on, then the rule is that 0 plus any other object. So 0 is a blicket, and the others are not, but their presence is needed. But according to the blicket definition, the others wouldn't be blickets because their state doesn't correlate with the machine's state. But if the machine's state depends on 0 and another object, then the mutual information between 0 and the machine is non-zero (since 0's presence is necessary), but the other objects' presence is also required. So in that case, 0 would be a blicket, and the others are not. Because the machine's state depends on 0's presence along with others, but the others' presence alone doesn't affect it. Wait, but the others' presence is required in combination with 0. So their states are also correlated with the machine's state. For example, when 0 is present and 1 is present, the machine is on. So the presence of 1 is also correlated. So in that case, both 0 and 1 would have mutual information with the machine's state.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. The definition says a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state depends on a combination of objects, then those objects are blickets if their presence or absence affects the machine's state in a way that's not independent.\n\nFor example, if the machine turns on only when both 0 and 1 are present, then both 0 and 1 are blickets, because their presence is necessary for the machine to be on. Their absence would make it off. So their states are correlated with the machine's state. Object 2's state is not correlated because whether it's on or off doesn't affect the machine's state. So in that case, 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be on.\n\nBut according to the steps, when all three were on, the machine was on. Then removing 1 (leaving 0 and 2) turned it off. Then removing 2 (leaving 0 alone) turned it off. So if the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on, then 2 is not a blicket. And when all three are on, it's still on because both 0 and 1 are present. So that fits. But then, when 0 and 2 are on, machine is off, which fits because 1 is not present. But how do we know if 2 is a blicket or not.\n\nBut according to the definition, a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state depends on 0 and 1's states, but not 2's, then 0 and 1 are blickets, and 2 is not. But how to determine this.\n\nThe user needs to test if 2's presence affects the machine. For example, if the rule is that 0 and 1 must be on, then putting 0 and 1 on (without 2) should turn the machine on. Let's see:\n\nIn the current state, 0 is on the machine, 1 and 2 are off. The machine is off. The user can put 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then the rule is 0 and 1 must be on. If it doesn't, then perhaps all three must be on.\n\nSo the next command should be to put object 1 on the machine again.\n\nAfter that, if the machine turns on, then the rule is 0 and 1. If not, maybe all three.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, when all three were on, the machine was on. Then removing 1 made it off. Then removing 2 made it off. So when 0 is on and 1 is added, the machine might turn on. Let's simulate:\n\nUser's next command: put object 1 on machine.\n\nResult: You put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n\nThen, taking 1 off again would turn it off.\n\nBut in this case, the user can test this. Alternatively, after putting 1 on, the machine turns on, then the user can take 2 off (but it's already off). So perhaps the rule is that 0 and 1 must be on.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nSo, the user should now put object 1 on the machine. Let's see what happens.\n\nIf the light turns on, then 0 and 1 are the blickets, and the rule is both must be present. If not, then maybe all three.\n\nBut given that in the previous steps, when 0 was added to 1 and 2, the machine turned on, but when 0 and 2 were on, it was off, it suggests that 1's presence is important. So perhaps the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on. Then 2 is not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0 and any other object must be on. So 0 is a blicket, and any other object (1 or 2) being present with 0 turns it on. So in that case, 0 is a blicket, and 1 and 2 are not, but their presence is required along with 0.\n\nBut according to the definition, a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if the machine's state depends on 0 and another object, then both 0 and that object are blickets. Because the presence of both affects the machine's state.\n\nBut if the rule is that the machine turns on when 0 is present along with any other object, then 0 and the other object (either 1 or 2) would both be blickets. Because their presence is necessary.\n\nBut in that case, when 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. When 0 and 2 are on, machine is on. But according to the previous steps, when 0 and 2 were on (after removing 1), the machine was off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in the previous steps:\n\nAfter putting all three on, machine was on.\n\nThen taking 1 off (leaving 0 and 2 on), machine turned off.\n\nSo that suggests that 0 and 2 are not sufficient. So the rule isn't that 0 plus any other. So perhaps the rule is that 0 and 1 must both be on. Then 2's presence doesn't matter.\n\nBut when all three were on, machine was on. Then removing 1 made it off. Adding 1 back would make it on again. But to test this, the user needs to put 1 back.\n\nSo the next command should be to put 1 on the machine.\n\nIf the machine turns on, then 0 and 1 are required. Then, putting 2 on as well would still keep it on. But removing 1 would turn it off again.\n\nAlternatively, if the machine doesn't turn on when 0 and 1 are on, then the rule must require all three.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when the user added 0 to 1 and 2, the machine turned on. So perhaps the rule is that all three must be present.\n\nBut why did adding 0 to 1 and 2 turn it on, but having 0 alone (initial state) didn't. Because all three are required.\n\nSo the possible conclusion is that all three objects are blickets, and the rule is that all must be on the machine for it to turn on.\n\nBut to confirm, the user needs to test if having two of them on (e.g., 0 and 1) would turn it on. If not, then the rule is all three.\n\nSo the next command is crucial. Putting 1 on now (with 0 already on) would test if 0 and 1 are sufficient.\n\nIf the machine turns on, then the rule is not all three. If it doesn't, then the rule is all three.\n\nBut according to previous steps, when 0 was added to 1 and 2, the machine turned on. So when all three are present, it's on. When only two are present (0 and 2, after removing 1), it's off. So if the user now puts 1 back on (0 and 1 on), and the machine turns on, then the rule is that 0 and 1 are required. If it doesn't, then all three are required.\n\nBut the user doesn't know until they try.\n\nGiven the current state, after taking 1 and 2 off, leaving 0 on the machine, the machine is off. Now, putting 1 on would make 0 and 1 on. Let's say the machine turns on. Then the rule would be that both 0 and 1 are blickets and must be present. Then, putting 2 on would make all three on, and the machine remains on. Then taking 2 off (leaving 0 and 1) would keep it on. But in the previous steps, when all three were on and 1 was removed, the machine turned off. So that would fit if the rule is that 0 and 1 must be present. Then, adding 2 doesn't affect, but removing 1 does.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, when all three were on, the machine was on. Then removing 1 turned it off. So if the rule is that 0 and 1 must be present, then even with 2 present or not, as long as 0 and 1 are on, the machine is on. But in that case, when the user puts 1 back on (with 0), the machine should turn on.\n\nBut the user needs to test this. So the next command is to put object 1 on the machine."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, I need to analyze the steps taken and the machine's responses.\n\nInitially, object 0 was on the machine, but the machine was off. When I took object 0 off and put objects 1 and 2 on, the machine stayed off. Then putting object 0 back on caused the machine to turn on. Later, when only objects 0 and 1 were on the machine, the machine was on. But when I removed objects 1 and 2, leaving object 0 on, the machine turned off. Then putting object 1 back on made it turn on again.\n\nWait, let's recap:\n\n- When all three objects were on the machine (0,1,2), the machine was on.\n- Then taking off 1 and 2 left only 0, machine turned off.\n- Then putting 1 back on (with 0 already on) turned it on again.\n- So, when 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it was off. When 1 and 2 were on, machine was off. Then adding 0 made it on. So maybe object 0 and object 1 together are required. But let's check:\n\nWait, another scenario: when 0,1,2 were all on, machine was on. Then removing 1 and 2 left 0, machine off. Then putting 1 back on (0 and 1 on), machine on. So with 0 and 1, it's on. But what about 1 alone? Let me check previous steps. When object 1 was put on the machine alone (after removing 0 and 2), the machine stayed off. Then when 0 was added, it turned on. So that suggests that both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine. But wait, when 1 was on the machine with 2, it was off. Then adding 0 turned it on. So maybe the rule is that either 0 or 1 is required, but perhaps both? Wait, no. Because when 0 and 1 are on, it's on. When 0 is alone, it's off. When 1 is alone, it's off. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, let's list all the observed states:\n\n1. Initially: 0 on, others off. Machine off.\n   - Took 0 off. Machine off.\n   - Put 1 on. Machine off.\n   - Put 2 on. Machine off.\n   - Put 0 on. Machine on. So all three on. Then machine on.\n\n2. Then took 1 and 2 off. Machine off. Only 0 on.\n   - Then put 1 on. Machine on. So 0 and 1 on, machine on.\n   - 2 is off.\n\nSo in this state, 0 and 1 are on, machine on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one of the blickets is on? But that doesn't fit because when 0 was alone, machine was off. Or maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on. Let's see:\n\nIf 0 and 1 are both blickets, then when both are on, machine is on. If either is off, machine is off. That would fit the observations. For example, when all three were on (including 0 and 1), machine on. When only 0 and 1 are on, machine on. When only 0 or 1 is on, machine off. Then when 0 was on initially (alone), machine off. Then when 0 was added back with others, machine on. Wait, but in the first step, when 0 was alone, machine was off. Then when 0 was added to 1 and 2, machine turned on. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, and both need to be on, then that makes sense. Because when 0 is added to 1 and 2 (so 0 and 1 are both on), machine turns on. Then when 1 is taken off, leaving 0 and 2, machine turns off. Then putting 1 back on (with 0 and 1 on) turns it on again. So the rule would be that both 0 and 1 must be on the machine for it to activate. Object 2 doesn't matter. Therefore, blickets are 0 and 1. The rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both 0 and 1 are on it.\n\nTo confirm, let's check another scenario. If I take off 0 and leave 1 on, machine should turn off. Let's see: in the current state, 0 and 1 are on. If I take 0 off, machine should turn off. Let's try that now. The next step would be to take object 0 off the machine and see if the light turns off. But according to previous steps, when 0 was alone, machine was off. So yes, if both 0 and 1 are required, removing either should turn it off. So in the current state, if I remove 0, machine should turn off. Let's do that."}

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. Let's recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. Then I took object 0 off and put 1 and 2 on, but the light stayed off. When I added object 0 back on, the light turned on. Then all three objects were on the machine, and the light was on.\n\nLater, when I took off objects 1 and 2, leaving only 0 on the machine, the light stayed off. But when I put object 1 back on the machine, the light turned on again. Wait, no, let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, after taking 1 and 2 off, object 0 was still on the machine? No, wait: After putting all three on, the light was on. Then I took 1 and 2 off, so only 0 was left. But the light turned off. Then putting 1 back on made the light turn on again. But when I took 0 off, leaving only 1 on, the light was off. Hmm, that might not be right. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nOriginal setup: 0 on machine, others on floor. Light off.\n\n1. Took 0 off. All on floor. Light off.\n2. Put 1 on. Light still off.\n3. Put 2 on. Light still off.\n4. Put 0 on. Light turns on. So with 0,1,2 on machine, light on.\n5. Took 1 and 2 off, leaving 0 on. Light off.\n6. Put 1 back on. Light turns on again. Now 0 and 1 on machine. So light is on here. Then took 0 off, leaving 1 on. Light turns off.\n\nWait, in the steps, after taking 1 and 2 off, the machine had 0 on it, but the light was off. Then putting 1 on made the light turn on. So when 0 and 1 are on, light is on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) makes the light off. So that suggests that both 0 and 1 might be blickets, but when they're together, the machine turns on. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are on it. Or maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, but when only 1 is on, light is off. When 1 and 0 are on, light is on. So perhaps both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But that doesn't fit because when 0 was on initially (alone), the light was off. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on. But that doesn't fit because when 0 was alone initially, the light was off.\n\nWait, initial state: object 0 on machine, light off. So that suggests that 0 alone doesn't activate it. Then when 1 and 2 are added, still no. Then adding 0 (so all three), light turns on. Then removing 1 and 2, leaving 0 again, light off. So maybe 0 isn't a blicket? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the machine requires a combination.\n\nWait, when 0,1,2 are all on, light is on. But when only 0 and 1 are on, light is on. When only 1 is on, light is on. Wait, no, after putting 1 on machine (step 10: put object 1 on machine, light turns on). Wait, after taking 1 and 2 off (step 9: took 2 off, light off), then step 10: put 1 on, light turns on. So when only 1 is on, light is on? But earlier, when 1 and 2 were on without 0, the light was off. Then adding 0 made it on. Then when 0 was on alone, light was off. Then adding 1 to 0 made it on again. Wait, no. Let me check the exact steps again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nInitial state: 0 on machine, 1 and 2 on floor. Light off.\n\n1. take 0 off. All on floor. Light off.\n2. put 1 on. Light off.\n3. put 2 on. Light off.\n4. put 0 on. Light turns on (now all three on machine).\n5. look: light on.\n6. took 1 off. Light off.\n7. took 2 off. Light off (only 0 on machine).\n8. put 1 on. Light turns on (0 and 1 on machine).\n9. look: light on with 0 and 1 on.\n10. take 0 off. Now only 1 on. Light off.\n\nSo when 0 and 1 are on, light is on. But when only 0 was on, light was off. When only 1 was on, light was off. But when 0 and 1 are together, light is on. So that suggests that the combination of 0 and 1 activates the machine. But what about when all three are on? It was on then. But maybe the third object (2) isn't a blicket. So the rule might be that at least two blickets are on the machine, and the blickets are 0 and 1. Let's test that.\n\nIf the rule is \"the machine turns on if at least two blickets are on it\", and the blickets are 0 and 1, then:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n- 1 alone: off.\n- 0 and 1: on.\n- All three (including 2): on, since 0 and 1 are present. 2's presence doesn't affect.\n\nBut when they put 1 on machine (step 10), after removing 0 and 2, the light turns on when only 1 is on? Wait, no. Wait, in step 8, after taking 1 and 2 off, only 0 is on. Then step 9: put 1 on machine. Now 0 and 1 are on. Light turns on. Then step 14: take 0 off, leaving only 1. Light turns off. So that aligns with the rule that the machine needs both 0 and 1 to be on. So the rule could be that both 0 and 1 must be on the machine. Then object 2 is irrelevant. But when all three were on, the light was on, which fits because 0 and 1 are present. When only 0 and 1 are on, light is on. When only 0 or 1 is on, it's off. So the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets and must be present. Therefore, the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. Object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nBut let's check another scenario. When they put 1 on machine (step 2) and 2 on (step3), the light was off. Then adding 0 (step4) turned it on. So with 0,1,2 on: on. Then removing 1 and 2 (steps 5 and 6), leaving 0, light off. Then putting 1 back (step8) with 0: light on. So that's consistent with 0 and 1 being required. But when only 1 and 2 are on (step3), light is off, which makes sense because 0 isn't there. So 2 isn't a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine to activate it. Object 2 is irrelevant. Let me check if there's any other possibility. For example, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine is even. But that doesn't fit because 0 and 1 (two blickets) would be even, but when all three are on (if 2 is a blicket, that's three, which would be odd). But in the steps, when all three are on, light is on. So that would require three blickets, but then when two are on (0 and 1), even, light on. But that complicates things. But given the data, the simplest rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets and both need to be present. So the answer should be blickets 0 and 1, rule is both must be on the machine."}

Then, when the user took object 0 off, the light remained off. Then, they put object 1 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then added object 2, still off. Finally, when they added object 0 back on the machine along with 1 and 2, the light turned on.\n\nLater, when they removed objects 1 and 2, leaving only object 0 on the machine, but after removing 1 and 2, the light went off. Wait, no, let me check again. \n\nWait, after putting all three objects on the machine (0,1,2), the light was on. Then they took off object 1 and 2, leaving object 0 on the machine. But when they took off 1 and 2, the light turned off. Then they put object 1 back on the machine (with object 0 still on?), and the light turned on again. Wait, let me check the exact steps.\n\nWait, the steps are:\n\n1. Initially, object 0 is on machine, others on floor. Light is off.\n2. Take object 0 off, machine still off.\n3. Put object 1 on machine, light still off.\n4. Put object 2 on machine, light still off.\n5. Put object 0 on machine, light turns on. So all three are on, light on.\n\nThen they take object 1 and 2 off, so only object 0 remains on the machine. After taking them off, the light turns off. Then they put object 1 back on (so 0 and 1 are on), and the light turns on again. \n\nWait, the step after taking 1 and 2 off: the machine's light is off. Then putting object 1 on, light turns on. So when objects 0 and 1 are on, the light is on. \n\nThen they take object 0 off, leaving object 1 on, and the light goes off. Then they look again, and the light is off. \n\nSo, key observations:\n\n- When object 0 was on the machine alone (after removing 1 and 2), light was off. But when object 0 was on with 1 and 2, light was on. Then when 0 and 1 were on, light was on. Then when 0 was removed, leaving 1, light went off. \n\nSo, the machine turns on when object 0 is present along with at least one other object. Or maybe object 0 is a blicket and another one is also a blicket. \n\nWait, but when they put object 0 on the machine with 1 and 2, the light came on. Then removing 1 and 2 (leaving 0) turned it off. Then adding 1 (so 0 and 1 are on) turned it on again. Then removing 0 (only 1 left) turned it off. So maybe object 0 and object 1 are both blickets, and the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps object 0 is a blicket and object 1 is a blicket, and the machine activates when at least one of them is present. Wait, but when 0 was alone, the machine was off. When 1 was alone, machine was off. But when both are on, it's on. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. \n\nWait, let's recap:\n\n- Start: 0 on, others off. Light off. So 0 alone didn't activate it.\n- Then after adding 1 and 2, then adding 0 again (all three on), light turns on. Wait, no, initial setup was 0 on, others off. Then they take 0 off, then put 1 on (machine has 1), light off. Then put 2 on (1 and 2 on), light off. Then put 0 on (0,1,2 on), light on. So with all three, it's on. Then removing 1 and 2 (only 0 left), light off. Then putting 1 on (0 and 1 on), light on. Removing 0 (1 left), light off. So, when 0 and 1 are both on, light is on. When either is alone, it's off. So this suggests that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. \n\nIf that's the case, then both 0 and 1 are blickets, because their presence together affects the machine's state. Object 2, when placed with others, didn't trigger the light until 0 was added. So 2 is probably not a blicket. \n\nSo, the rule might be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. But in the case where 0 and 1 are on, it's on. When 0 is alone, off. When 1 is alone, off. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be present. Then, 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires both. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present. But in that case, when 0 was on alone (initially), the machine was off, which would contradict. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. Let's see. If 0 and 1 are blickets, then when they are both on, it's two, which activates. If only one is on, it's not. \n\nBut in the first case, when all three (0,1,2) are on, it's active. But if 2 is not a blicket, then it's still two blickets (0 and 1) which would activate the machine. So that fits. \n\nSo the rule would be that the machine turns on when two or more blickets are on it. But in this case, only 0 and 1 are blickets. So when they are both on, it's on. When 0 is on with 2 (non-blicket), it's only one blicket, so off. \n\nBut wait, in the steps when 0 and 1 are on, the machine is on. When 0 is on with 2 (earlier steps?), but that might not have happened. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the user put object 0 on the machine along with 1 and 2, and the light turned on. Then they removed 1 and 2, leaving 0 alone, and the light went off. Then they added 1 back, so 0 and 1 are on, light on. So that supports that 0 and 1 together activate the machine. \n\nSo, the rule could be that the machine activates when both 0 and 1 are on. Therefore, both 0 and 1 are blickets, and 2 is not. \n\nBut the initial state had 0 on the machine alone, and the light was off. So 0 alone doesn't activate it. Then when 1 was added (so 0 was off, 1 on), light off. Then adding 2 (1 and 2 on), light off. Then adding 0 (all three), light on. Then when taking off 1 and 2 (only 0), light off. Then adding 1 (0 and 1 on), light on. Taking off 0 (only 1), light off. \n\nSo the machine turns on when both 0 and 1 are present. Therefore, both are blickets. \n\nSo, object 0 is a blicket (True), object 1 is a blicket (True), and object 2 is not (False). \n\nTherefore, the answer for object 0 is True."}

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

So, from the interactions, the machine turns on when certain objects are placed on it. The key is to see which objects' presence on the machine affects the machine's state (light on or off).\n\nInitially, object 0 was on the machine, but the light was off. When the user took object 0 off, then put object 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then they added object 2, still off. Then when they put object 0 back on, all three objects were on the machine and the light turned on.\n\nLater, when only objects 0 and 1 were on the machine (after removing 2), the light was on. Then when object 0 was taken off, leaving only object 1 on the machine, the light turned off. But then putting object 1 back on made the light turn on again? Wait, let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, after taking objects 1 and 2 off, the user put object 1 on the machine again, and the light turned on. Wait, but object 0 was still on the floor. Wait, no: Let me check the exact sequence.\n\nAfter taking 1 and 2 off, the user put object 1 on the machine. The light turned on. But object 0 was on the machine at that point? Wait, the log says: \n\nAfter taking 0 off the machine, objects 0 is on the floor, 1 and 2 are off. Then the user puts object 1 on the machine. Then the light is off. Wait, no, let's retrace:\n\nWait, the steps:\n\n1. Initially, object 0 is on machine, others on floor. Light off.\n2. Take 0 off. Now all on floor except none on machine. Light still off.\n3. Put 1 on machine. Light still off.\n4. Put 2 on machine. Light still off.\n5. Put 0 on machine. Now all three on machine. Light turns on.\n6. Then take 1 and 2 off. Light turns off.\n7. Put 1 back on machine. Light turns on. Wait, but at this point, objects on the machine are 0 and 1? Wait, no. Wait, after step 5, all three are on the machine. Then step 6: take 1 and 2 off. So machine has only 0 left. Then when they put 1 back on, machine now has 0 and 1. The light turns on. Then when they take 0 off, leaving only 1 on, the light turns off. But then when they put 1 back on, the light is on again? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look step by step.\n\nWait, the exact log after step 5:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on machine, light is on. Then:\n\n> take object 1 off machine. Light turns off. Now objects on machine: 0 and 2? Or wait, no. Let me check:\n\nAfter step 5: All three are on machine. Then step 6:\n\n> take object 1 off machine. Machine now has 0 and 2. Light is off.\n\nThen take object 2 off machine. Now machine has only 0. Light is still off.\n\nThen put object 1 on machine. Now machine has 0 and 1. Light turns on. So with 0 and 1 on, light is on. Then take 0 off machine. Now machine has only 1. Light turns off. Then putting 1 back on (but it was already on, perhaps a mistake here?) Wait, maybe the user tried to take 0 off and then check. So when machine has 0 and 1, light is on. Taking 0 off leaves 1, light off. So object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. But when 0 is on the machine with 1, the light is on. So perhaps object 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. Or maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on. Wait, need more data.\n\nWait, when all three are on, the light is on. When only 0 and 1 are on, light is on. When only 0 and 2 are on, not tested. When only 0 is on, light is off? Wait, after step 5, all three are on, light on. Then take 1 and 2 off, leaving 0 on. The light turns off. So 0 alone doesn't activate the machine. Wait, that's confusing. Because when they had 0,1,2 on, light on. Then taking 1 off (leaving 0 and 2) light turns off. Then taking 2 off (leaving 0) light remains off. Then putting 1 back on (so 0 and 1) light turns on. So 0 and 1 on machine, light on. 0 and 2 on machine: not tested. But if 0 is a blicket, but when alone, it doesn't activate. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when two blickets are present? Or maybe object 1 is a blicket and object 0 is not. Wait, but in the step where they put 0 on the machine (after 1 and 2 were already on), the light turned on. So 0's presence caused the light to turn on. But when 0 was alone, it didn't. So perhaps object 0 is a blicket, but the machine requires at least two blickets. Or maybe it's an AND condition: both 0 and 1 must be on. Let's see:\n\nWhen 0 and 1 are on, light is on. When 0 is alone, off. When 1 is alone (after taking 0 off), light is off. So maybe the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. Then, in the case where all three are on, it's still on, but that's covered by 0 and 1. So perhaps 0 and 1 are blickets. But let's check other steps.\n\nWait, initial state: object 0 was on the machine, others on floor. Light off. So 0 alone doesn't activate. Then when 0 was removed, and 1 added, light off. Then 2 added, still off. Then 0 added, all three on, light on. So adding 0 (with 1 and 2) makes it turn on. So maybe 0 is a blicket. Because when 0 is on, and others are on, but in that case, the light was on. But when 0 is on alone, it's off. So perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present, but only if a certain condition is met. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Wait, when 0 and 1 are on, light on. When 0 is on alone, off. So that would suggest that 0 and 1 are both blickets, and the machine requires at least two. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on. But if 0 and 1 are blickets, then when both are on, the machine is on. When only one is on, it's off. So that would be an AND rule. Let's see:\n\nIf the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Then if there are two blickets (say 0 and 1), then both must be on. So when 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. If only one is on, it's off. But when all three are on (including 2, which isn't a blicket), machine is on. So that fits. Then in that case, the blickets are 0 and 1. Because when both are on, the machine is on. If either is missing, it's off. Let's check the steps again.\n\nInitial state: object 0 on machine. Others off. Machine off. So if 0 is a blicket, but machine is off, which would contradict the rule. Unless there's another blicket that's required. So maybe 0 and 1 are both required.\n\nAfter taking 0 off, putting 1 on: machine off. Then put 2 on: still off. Then put 0 on: now machine has 0,1,2. Machine on. So 0 and 1 are present. Then taking 1 off: machine has 0 and 2. Machine turns off. Taking 2 off: machine has 0. Still off. Putting 1 back on: machine has 0 and 1. Machine on. So that suggests that when both 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. Even if 2 is on or off. So the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on. Then those are the blickets. Object 2 is not a blicket. So in that case, object 1 is a blicket. Therefore, the answer is True."}

You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

From the interactions, the machine's light turns on when certain objects are placed on it. The key is to see when the machine activates and which objects are present.\n\nInitially, object 0 was on the machine, but the light was off. When I took object 0 off and put objects 1 and 2 on, the light stayed off. Then, when I added object 0 back, the light turned on. That suggests object 0 is a blicket. But when I removed object 0 and 2, and only had object 1 on the machine, the light turned on again. Wait, no\u2014after removing objects 1 and 2, putting only object 1 back made the light turn on. Wait, let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, the steps were: After taking 1 and 2 off, then putting 1 on, the light was on. Then, when object 0 was taken off, the light turned off. Wait, maybe I need to track each action carefully.\n\nLet me list the key steps:\n\n1. Initially, object 0 was on the machine. Light off.\n2. Took object 0 off. Light still off.\n3. Put object 1 on machine. Light off.\n4. Put object 2 on machine. Light off.\n5. Put object 0 on machine. Light turned on. So with all three on, light is on. But maybe the presence of object 0 is required.\n\nThen, took 1 and 2 off. Then put 1 back on. At that point, object 0 was still on the machine. Wait, no: after taking 1 and 2 off, machine had only object 0. Then put 1 on, making objects 0 and 1 on the machine. The light was on. Then took object 0 off, leaving only object 1 on the machine, and the light turned off. So when object 0 is on, even with others, the light is on. When object 0 is off, even if others are on, light is off. \n\nWait, but when object 1 was put on the machine with object 0, the light was on. Then taking 0 off made it turn off. So that suggests object 0 is a blicket. But when object 1 was on alone, light was off. Then when object 0 was added again, light turned on. So maybe object 0 is the only blicket. \n\nBut what about object 2? When all three were on, the light was on. Then removing 1 and 2 left only 0, and the light stayed on? Wait no: when all three were on, then taking 1 and 2 off (leaving 0) would the light stay on? Wait, in the steps, after putting all three on (0,1,2), the light was on. Then taking 1 and 2 off would leave 0 on the machine. The light would stay on if 0 is a blicket. But in the actual steps, after taking 1 and 2 off, the user took object 1 off and then put 1 back on. Wait, the log says: after taking 1 and 2 off, the light was off. Then putting 1 on made the light on. Wait, no. Let me check the exact steps:\n\nAfter putting all three on, the light is on. Then:\n\n> take object 1 off machine \u2192 light off\n> take object 2 off machine \u2192 light still off (since 0 is still on? Wait no, after taking 1 off, light turned off. But object 0 was still on. Wait, maybe I need to check each step's result.\n\nWait, the log shows:\n\nAfter all three are on (0,1,2), the light is on.\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 1 off machine \u2192 light turns off. So even though 0 and 2 are still on, removing 1 causes the light to turn off. But that contradicts the previous step where adding 0 made the light turn on. Wait, this is confusing. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal setup:\n\n- Initial state: 0 on machine, 1 and 2 on floor. Light off.\n\n- Take 0 off: light still off.\n\n- Put 1 on: light off.\n\n- Put 2 on: light off.\n\n- Put 0 on: light turns on. Now all three on machine. Light on.\n\nThen, take 1 off: light turns off. So with 0 and 2 on the machine, the light is off. Then take 2 off: light still off. So now only 0 is on the floor. Then put 1 on: light turns on. So now 1 is on the machine (and 0 and 2 are off). Wait, no. Wait after taking 1 and 2 off, machine is empty. Then putting 1 on, so only 1 is on the machine, and the light turns on. Then taking 0 off (but 0 was already on the floor) might not affect. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the log steps:\n\n1. After putting 0,1,2 on machine, light on.\n\n2. Take 1 off \u2192 light off. Now objects 0 and 2 on machine. Light off.\n\n3. Take 2 off \u2192 light off. Now object 0 is on machine. Light off.\n\nWait, but earlier when object 0 was on the machine with 1 and 2, the light was on. But when only 0 is on the machine, light is off. That suggests that 0 alone doesn't activate the machine. Then when 1 was added (so 0 and 1 on machine), light turned on. Wait, no. Let me check the exact sequence:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2 on machine, light is on. Then:\n\n> take object 1 off machine \u2192 light turns off. Now objects 0 and 2 on machine. Light off.\n\nThen take object 2 off \u2192 light remains off. Now only 0 is on machine. Light off.\n\nThen put object 1 on machine \u2192 objects 0 and 1 on machine. Light turns on.\n\nThen take object 0 off \u2192 only object 1 on machine. Light turns off.\n\nSo from this, when 0 and 1 are on the machine, light is on. But when only 0 is on, light is off. When only 1 is on, light is off. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine. But wait, when all three were on (0,1,2), the light was on. Then removing 1 made it turn off. So even with 0 and 2 on, without 1, light is off. But earlier, when 0 was added to 1 and 2, the light turned on. Hmm, conflicting info.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are on it. If 0 and 1 are blickets, then putting them both on activates the machine. But when all three are on, including 2 (non-blicket), it still works. Then when 1 is removed, leaving 0 and 2, the machine turns off because only one blicket (0) is present. But that would require 0 and 1 to be blickets, and 2 not.\n\nBut let's look at another test: When only object 1 was on the machine (after taking 0 off), the light was on. Wait, no. After taking 0 off, putting 1 on made the light on. Wait, let me check again:\n\nAfter the step where the user took 0 off (object 0 on floor), then put 1 on machine. The log says: \"You put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So with only object 1 on the machine, the light is on. But earlier, when object 1 was on the machine with 2, the light was off. Then adding 0 made it turn on. Wait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the exact actions and outcomes:\n\nInitial state: 0 on machine, others on floor. Light off.\n\n1. Take 0 off \u2192 light off.\n\n2. Put 1 on \u2192 light off.\n\n3. Put 2 on \u2192 light off.\n\n4. Put 0 on \u2192 light turns on. So now all three on machine, light on.\n\n5. Take 1 off \u2192 light turns off. Now 0 and 2 on machine.\n\n6. Take 2 off \u2192 light off. Now only 0 on machine.\n\n7. Put 1 on \u2192 light on. Now 0 and 1 on machine.\n\n8. Take 0 off \u2192 light off. Now only 1 on machine.\n\nSo when 0 and 1 are on, light is on. When only 0 is on, light off. When only 1 is on, light off. When 1 and 2 are on, light off. When all three are on, light on. When 0 is added to 1 and 2, light turns on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when both 0 and 1 are present. Object 2 is irrelevant. But when all three are on, the presence of 2 doesn't affect as long as 0 and 1 are there. Then, when 1 is removed, leaving 0 and 2, the light turns off because 1 is missing. So the rule could be that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. Thus, 0 and 1 are blickets. Object 2 is not a blicket. \n\nBut another possibility: Maybe the machine turns on when any blicket is present. But that doesn't fit because when 0 was alone, light was off. When 1 was alone, light was on. Wait, no. In step 7, after putting 1 on (while 0 was on the machine), the light turned on. Then when taking 0 off, leaving 1 alone, light turned off. So that suggests that 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. But in step 7, when 1 was added to 0 (which was already on the machine), the light turned on. Wait, no. Wait, after step 6: only 0 is on the machine (light off). Then step 7: put 1 on. Now 0 and 1 are on the machine, and the light turns on. Then step 8: take 0 off, leaving 1 on. Light turns off. So the machine only turns on when both 0 and 1 are present. Thus, both 0 and 1 are blickets, and 2 is not. \n\nBut earlier, when all three (0,1,2) were on, the light was on. Then removing 1 caused it to turn off (even though 0 and 2 were still on). That supports that 1 is a blicket. Similarly, when 0 was removed, leaving 1, the light turned off. So the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on the machine. Therefore, both are blickets. Object 2's presence doesn't affect the outcome. Therefore, object 2 is not a blicket."}
