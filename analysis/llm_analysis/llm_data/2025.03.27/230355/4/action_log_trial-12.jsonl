So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. All were on the floor initially. The machine starts off.\n\nFirst, I tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then object 1, still off. Then object 2, and the light turned on. Hmm. So putting all three on didn't work until object 2 was added. Wait, wait. Wait, when I put object 0 on, the response was \"0 is not a recognized object\"? Wait, no, that first attempt might have been a mistake. Wait the user input first was \"put 0 on machine\" and the system said \"0 is not a recognized object.\" Then the user tried \"put object 0 on machine\" and that worked. Maybe the syntax needs to be exact. So after correctly putting object 0, then 1, then 2, the machine turned on when all three were on. Wait, but the initial machine state was off. So when all three are placed, the machine turns on. So maybe all three are required? But maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the user's first command was \"put 0 on machine\" which the system didn't recognize, hence the error. Then they corrected to \"put object 0 on machine\" and succeeded. Then added 1, machine still off. Then added 2, machine turned on. So the machine turned on when all three are placed. So the rule might be that all objects need to be on the machine for it to activate. But maybe not. Alternatively, maybe only object 2 is a blicket. Because when object 2 was added, the machine turned on. Wait, but when you add objects one by one, the machine's state changes only when 2 is placed. Let me retrace:\n\n- After putting 0: machine off.\n- After putting 1: still off.\n- After putting 2: on.\n\nSo when object 2 was placed, the machine turned on. So maybe object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. But wait, when 0 and 1 were on, machine was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the others are not. So the rule is the machine turns on when any blicket is on it, and 2 is the only blicket. But why didn't the machine turn on when 2 was placed alone? Wait, in the sequence, the user placed 0, then 1, then 2. So when they placed 0, then 1, then 2. So all three were on the machine when the light turned on. Wait, no, the user's actions were:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine \u2192 machine off\n2. put object 1 on machine \u2192 machine off\n3. put object 2 on machine \u2192 machine on\n\nSo after adding each object one by one, the machine only turns on when 2 is placed. That suggests that the presence of object 2 on the machine causes it to turn on. But if the machine requires at least one blicket, then if 2 is a blicket, putting it on the machine should turn it on regardless of the others. But in this case, when 0 and 1 were on, adding 2 made it turn on. But maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If 2 is the only blicket, then putting it on would activate the machine. But in that case, if the user had put 2 first, the machine would turn on. However, the user didn't test that. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Then, if 2 is a blicket, putting it on would activate the machine. But in the user's case, when they added 2, it turned on even though 0 and 1 were already there. So maybe 2 is a blicket. Then, to confirm, the user should test other combinations. For example, take off 0 and 1, leaving only 2. If the machine stays on, then the rule is that at least one blicket is on. If the machine turns off when others are removed, then the rule is that all objects must be on, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on. If 2 is the only blicket, then putting it on would suffice. But the user added all three, and it turned on. But maybe that's a coincidence, and the machine only needs 2. To test, the user could remove 0 and 1, and see if the machine remains on. So next steps could be taking off 0 and 1. Let's try that.\n\nSo the next command should be to take object 0 off the machine. Let's see what happens. If the machine stays on, that suggests that only 2 is needed. If it turns off, then maybe all three are needed. But according to the initial test, when 0 and 1 were on, machine was off, then adding 2 turned it on. So maybe the presence of 2 is sufficient. Let's try removing 0 and 1. If the machine remains on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the combination of 2 with others is needed. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on, and 2 is the only blicket, so once it's on, the machine stays on regardless of others. But need to test."}

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. Let's recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, all objects were on the floor. Then, when I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. But when I added object 2, the light turned on. Then I took object 0 off, and the light stayed on. Now, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, and the light is on. When I look, the light is still on.\n\nHmm. So putting objects 0, 1, and 2 all on the machine made the light turn on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. That suggests that maybe the presence of objects 1 and 2 together is what's causing the machine to turn on. But let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, when only 0 was on the machine, nothing. Then adding 1, still nothing. Then adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe the rule is that all objects on the machine must include 2? Or maybe a certain combination. Wait, but when I removed 0, the light stayed on. So 0 isn't necessary. So the key might be that objects 1 and 2 together are required, or perhaps object 2 alone is sufficient. But let's check.\n\nWait, when I first put 0 on, then 1, then 2, the light turned on. Then taking 0 off didn't turn it off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two objects are on it, and at least one of them is a blicket. Or maybe it's that the presence of any blicket activates it. But when objects 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So 2 must be a blicket. But what about 1?\n\nWait, when I put 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is on. If I take 1 off, does it stay on? Let's test that. If I take object 1 off, leaving just 2 on, does the light stay on? If yes, then 2 alone is a blicket. If the light turns off, then maybe both 1 and 2 are needed.\n\nBut in the current state, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, light is on. Let me try taking 1 off. If the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets, but the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Or maybe the machine activates when any blicket is present. Wait, but in the first step, when 0 was on, nothing. Then 0 and 1, nothing. Then adding 2 made it work. So 2 is a blicket. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So maybe 2 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Because when 2 was added, even with others, it turned on. But when 2 was on with 1, and then 0 was removed, it stayed on. So if 2 is the only blicket, then the presence of 2 on the machine activates it. But why did adding 2 when others were already on make it activate? Because 2 is a blicket. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it. Then, the blickets are objects that when placed on the machine, cause the machine to turn on. But in that case, when I first put 0, then 1, nothing. Then adding 2 caused activation. So 2 is a blicket. Then, taking 0 off didn't affect, because 2 is still there. So 2 is a blicket. What about 1? Let's see. If I take 1 off now, and the light stays on, then 2 is the only blicket. If the light goes off, then maybe 1 is also a blicket. Let me test that.\n\nSo the next step would be to take object 1 off the machine and see if the light stays on. If it does, then 2 is the blicket and the rule is having at least one blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be present. But let's think. When I had 0 and 1 on, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So 2's presence must be the trigger. Then, when 2 and 1 are on, taking 1 off would leave 2, which should keep the light on. So I predict that after taking 1 off, the light stays on, confirming 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. But wait, the problem states that a blicket is an object whose state (on machine or not) is not independent of the machine's state. So mutual information is non-zero. So if the machine's state depends on the presence of the blicket, then the blicket's presence affects the machine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So if there are multiple blickets, they all need to be on. Let's consider that. Suppose objects 1 and 2 are blickets. Then, when they are both on the machine, the light turns on. If either is removed, it turns off. But in the previous steps, when we had 0,1,2 on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) left 1 and 2 (both blickets), so the light stayed on. If we then take off 1, leaving only 2, and the light turns off, that would mean the rule is all blickets must be present. But that's not possible because when we first added 2, the light turned on even though 1 was already there. Wait, no. Wait, when we added 2, we had 0,1,2 on the machine. The light turned on. If the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then perhaps 2 is the only blicket. Because even if 1 was there, adding 2 (the only blicket) would activate it. Then, removing 0 doesn't affect, as long as 2 is there. So if the rule is that at least one blicket is on, then 2 is a blicket. But how do I confirm if 1 is also a blicket?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. Let's see: when 0 and 1 were on, nothing. Then adding 2 made three objects, but maybe the rule is that two blickets are needed. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then putting both on would trigger the machine. But when I added 2 to 0 and 1, the machine turned on. But 0 is not a blicket. So in that case, 1 and 2 together would be two blickets. So if the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present, then that would make sense. But then, when I take off 0, leaving 1 and 2, the light stays on. Then, if I take off 1, leaving 2, the light would go off. Because only one blicket (2) remains, which is less than two. So that would fit. But earlier steps need to be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if an even number of blickets are on it. But that's more complicated. Let's try to think of the simplest possible rules. The most straightforward is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. So, if any blicket is present, the light is on. Then, in the current state, 1 and 2 are on. If 2 is a blicket, then the light is on. If I take off 1, leaving 2, the light stays on. If 1 is also a blicket, then even if I take off 1, 2 is still a blicket, so the light stays on. So to check if 1 is a blicket, I need to see if the machine turns on when only 1 is present. Let's test that.\n\nCurrently, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. The light is on. If I take off 2, leaving 1, what happens? Wait, but in the current state, I can only take off objects that are on the machine. So if I take object 2 off, leaving 1, does the light stay on or turn off? If the light turns off, that would suggest that 2 is the only blicket. If the light stays on, then 1 is also a blicket. But in this scenario, when I first added 0 and 1, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So if 1 was a blicket, putting 0 and 1 on should have turned it on. But it didn't. So that suggests 1 is not a blicket, and 2 is the only one. Therefore, the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it, and 2 is the blicket. But let's confirm.\n\nIf I take 1 off now, leaving 2 on the machine, the light should stay on. Then, if I take 2 off, the light should turn off. Let's try that. So next step: take object 1 off the machine. Then check the light. If it stays on, then 2 is a blicket. Then take 2 off, light should go off. That would confirm.\n\nBut in the current state, after taking 0 off, 1 and 2 are on. The light is on. So taking 1 off would leave 2. If the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then 1 and 2 are both required. But earlier when 0,1,2 were on, the light was on. Then removing 0 didn't affect. So if the rule requires both 1 and 2, then even if I have 1 and 2, the light would be on, but if I remove one, it would turn off. Let's test that.\n\nSo the next command would be to take object 1 off the machine. If the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then both 1 and 2 are needed. Let's proceed with that."}

The goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, here's what happened:\n\n1. When I put object 0 on the machine, nothing happened. The light stayed off.\n2. Then object 1 was added, still the light was off.\n3. When object 2 was added after 0 and 1, the light turned on.\n4. Then I took object 0 off, and the light remained on.\n5. When I took object 1 off, the light turned off again.\n\nSo, after removing object 1, the machine turned off. That suggests that object 1 might be a blicket. Wait, but when object 2 was on the machine along with 1 and 0, the light was on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it, but removing 1 turned it off. So maybe the presence of both 1 and 2 is required. Let me think.\n\nWait, initially, all three objects were on the machine, and the light turned on. Then after removing 0, it stayed on. Then removing 1 made it turn off. So with only object 2 left, the light turned off. But when objects 1 and 2 were on the machine, the light was on. Then when 1 was removed, leaving 2 alone, the light turned off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. Or maybe it's a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each blicket contributes something, and the total needs to meet a threshold. Let's look at the steps again:\n\n- Put 0, 1, 2 on machine: light on.\n- Take 0 off: light remains on (so 0 isn't necessary once others are there).\n- Take 1 off: light turns off. Now only 2 is left. So perhaps 1 and 2 together are required. Because when both 1 and 2 were on, the light was on. But when only 2 was there, it's off. Wait, but when 1 was taken off, the light turned off even though 2 was still on. So maybe 1 is a blicket and 2 is not, but that doesn't fit because when 2 was added, the light turned on. Wait, the initial steps: putting 0 and 1 on didn't activate the machine. Then adding 2 turned it on. Then removing 0 didn't change it. Then removing 1 turned it off. So the presence of 2 and 1 kept it on. So maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. Because when 1 and 2 were on, it worked. When only 2 was there, it didn't. Wait, but when 1 was removed, leaving 2, the light turned off. So if 2 was a blicket, then maybe one isn't enough. So the rule could be that the machine turns on if two or more blickets are on it. But then, in the first step, when 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it on. If 0 is not a blicket, 1 and 2 are, then putting both 1 and 2 on would make two blickets, so the machine turns on. Then removing 1 leaves only 2 (a blicket), so the machine would turn off because it needs two. That would fit. So in that case, blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on it. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there are two blickets (1 and 2), then both need to be on. Let's test that. When 1 and 2 are on, machine is on. If either is removed, machine turns off. That would fit. But in the initial step, when 0,1,2 were all on, machine was on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So if the rule is all blickets must be on, then if 1 and 2 are the only blickets, they both need to be on. So when both are on, machine is on. If one is removed, machine turns off. That's exactly what happened. So maybe the rule is that all blickets must be present on the machine for it to activate. But how many blickets are there? If 1 and 2 are the blickets, then putting both on would activate it. Let's see the steps again:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2 on: light on. But if 0 is not a blicket, then having all three doesn't matter as long as all blickets (1 and 2) are on. So machine on.\n\n- Remove 0: still on because 1 and 2 are there.\n\n- Remove 1: machine turns off because now only 2 is left (a blicket). So the rule would require all blickets to be present, but that doesn't fit. Because if all blickets are 1 and 2, then both must be on. So if you remove one, the machine turns off. That's what happened here. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So in this case, 1 and 2 are blickets. Because when they're both on, machine is on. If either is removed, machine turns off. And object 0 isn't a blicket. Let's check other possibilities. If the rule was \"any blicket present\", then having 1 or 2 would activate it. But when only 2 was on, it was off. So that's not the case. So the rule must be that all blickets must be on the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 2. To confirm, perhaps I can test putting 1 and 2 back on without 0. Let's see. Currently, after taking 1 off, the machine is off. Let's try putting 1 back on. If I put 1 back on, then both 1 and 2 would be on, and the machine should turn on. Let's do that. So next command: put object 1 on machine. Then check the light. If it turns on, that supports the hypothesis. Then take 2 off, and see if the light turns off. But I have limited steps. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. But I need to check. Let's proceed step by step."}

So far, here's what I've observed:\n\nInitially, all three objects (0, 1, 2) were on the floor, and the machine was off. \n\nFirst, I put object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, still off. When I added object 2, the light turned on. So with all three on the machine, it's on. Then I took off object 0, and the light remained on. That suggests that object 0 might not be a blicket because removing it didn't affect the state. But when I took off object 1, the light turned off. Then putting back object 1 made the light turn on again. \n\nWait, after taking off object 0, the machine stayed on with 1 and 2. Then removing 1 caused it to turn off, even though 2 was still on. So maybe object 1 and 2 are both blickets. But when I took 1 off, leaving 2 on the machine, the light went off. Then putting 1 back made it turn on again. That suggests that both 1 and 2 are necessary? Or maybe it's an OR condition. Wait, no. Let's think again:\n\nWhen all three were on, the light was on. Removing 0 (not a blicket) didn't change anything. Then removing 1 caused the light to turn off even though 2 was still there. Then putting 1 back made it turn on again. So if 2 alone wasn't enough, but 1 and 2 together work, maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 need to be on the machine. But wait, when I initially put 0 and 1 on, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So maybe the rule is that the presence of both 1 and 2 is required. But that would mean that both are blickets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that at least two blickets need to be on the machine. Let's see: when 0 and 1 were on (assuming 0 is not a blicket, and 1 is), then maybe only 1 was a blicket, so not enough. Then adding 2 (a blicket) made two blickets (1 and 2), so the light turns on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 and 2, light stays on. Removing 1 leaves only 2, which if it's a blicket, but maybe the rule is that you need at least two blickets. So when you remove 1, only one blicket (2) remains, so the light turns off. Then adding 1 back gives two blickets again, so light on. \n\nSo possible rule: the machine turns on when at least two blickets are placed on it. And the blickets are 1 and 2. Object 0 is not a blicket. \n\nBut let's verify. When I put 0 and 1 on, light off. Then adding 2 (blicket) makes two blickets (1 and 2), so light on. Then taking 0 off, no change. Taking 1 off leaves only 2 (one blicket), so light off. Then putting 1 back, two blickets again, light on. That fits. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be present. Let's see: when I have 1 and 2 on the machine, light is on. If I take off 1, light goes off. So that would mean both are required. But in that case, even if you have 1 and 2 on, adding 0 doesn't change anything, which is consistent. \n\nSo which is it? The difference between the two possibilities is whether the rule is \"exactly both 1 and 2\" or \"at least two blickets\". But in the initial test, putting 0, 1, and 2 on the machine turned it on. Taking off 0 (non-blicket) left 1 and 2, which kept it on. Then taking off 1 (leaving 2) turned it off. That suggests that both 1 and 2 are required. So the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. \n\nBut wait, when I put 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is on. If the rule was \"at least two\", but 0 is not a blicket, then 1 and 2 being blickets would satisfy \"at least two\", so light on. If the rule is \"both 1 and 2 must be present\", then same result. \n\nBut how to test between these possibilities. For example, if there's a third blicket (but there are only three objects here), but since there's only three objects, maybe 0 isn't a blicket, and 1 and 2 are. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is \"at least one blicket\", but that doesn't fit because when 1 was on the machine alone (after putting 1 on, then 2, then taking 2 off?), but in the steps taken, when 1 was put on initially, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So 1 alone didn't do it. So 1 alone isn't enough. Then 2 alone (after removing 1) also wasn't enough. So the rule might be that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. Therefore, both are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. \n\nSo the blickets are 1 and 2. The rule is that the machine turns on when both 1 and 2 are placed on it. \n\nBut wait, let's check the initial steps again:\n\n- Put 0 on machine: light off.\n- Put 1 on machine: light still off.\n- Put 2 on machine: light on.\n\nSo adding 2 to 0 and 1 (non-blicket and 1) turns it on. So if 2 is a blicket, and 1 is also a blicket, then having both 1 and 2 on the machine would trigger the light. Even with 0 (non-blicket) present. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 and 2, light stays on. Then removing 1 (one blicket) leaves 2, light off. Adding 1 back, light on. \n\nTherefore, the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. So they are both blickets. Object 0 is not a blicket. \n\nSo I think that's the answer. The blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine for it to activate."}

But when only 1 is on (after removing 2?), no. Wait, let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, the user put all three on the machine, and the light turned on. Then they took object 0 off, and the light remained on. Then took object 1 off, which caused the light to turn off. Then put object 1 back on, and the light turned on again. At that point, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine. So with 1 and 2 on, the light is on. But when only 2 was on (after taking 1 off), the light turned off. Then adding 1 back turned it on. So maybe the rule is that at least two blickets need to be on the machine. Or maybe the presence of both 1 and 2 activates it. Let me see.\n\nWait, the initial state was all objects on floor. Then after putting 0,1,2 on machine, the light turned on. Then removing 0 didn't affect the light (still on). Then removing 1 caused the light to turn off. So when only object 2 was left on the machine, the light was off. Then putting 1 back made the light turn on again. So in that case, with 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is on. But when only 2 was on, it's off. So that suggests that object 1 is a blicket because when it's present with 2, the machine is on. But maybe object 2 is also a blicket. Wait, let's see another scenario.\n\nWait, when they put all three on, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 didn't change it. Then removing 1 turned it off, leaving 2 on. Then putting 1 back on turned it on again. So when 1 and 2 are on, the machine is on. But what if only 1 is on? Let's think. The user didn't test that scenario. But from the steps given, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when both 1 and 2 are on. Alternatively, maybe either 1 or 2 is a blicket, but the rule is that the machine is on when at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when they took 1 off and only 2 was left, the machine turned off. So if 2 was a blicket, then the machine should stay on. But since it turned off, that suggests 2 alone isn't a blicket. So maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both need to be present. Wait, but when 1 and 2 are on, the machine is on, but when either is removed, it's off. So that would imply the rule is that both are required. So both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the machine turns on when both are on it. Then object 0 is not a blicket because when it was on the machine with others, removing it didn't affect the light. But how do we know for sure?\n\nWait, when all three were on the machine (0,1,2), light is on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) kept the light on. So 0's presence or absence doesn't affect the light once 1 and 2 are on. So 0 isn't a blicket. Then, taking 1 off (leaving only 2) turned the light off. So the machine turns off when only 2 is on. Then putting 1 back on (so 1 and 2) turns it on again. So that suggests that the machine is on only when both 1 and 2 are on. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. So object 1 is a blicket. Therefore, the answer is True."}

I need to figure out if object 2 is a blicket. Blickets are objects that affect the machine's state, meaning their presence has a non-zero mutual information with the machine turning on.\n\nFrom the steps taken in the game: \n\n- When all three objects (0, 1, 2) were placed on the machine, the light turned on. Then when object 0 was removed, the light stayed on. But when object 1 was removed, the light turned off. Then putting object 1 back on turned it on again.\n\nWait, let's parse the actions again. The user put 0,1,2 on the machine one by one. After putting 2 on, the machine turned on. Then they took 0 off, machine stayed on. Then took 1 off, machine turned off. Then putting 1 back on turned it on again. \n\nSo when all three are on, machine is on. Taking 0 off didn't affect it. But taking 1 off caused it to turn off. Then adding 1 back made it turn on. So maybe the machine requires at least two objects, but only certain ones. Or maybe objects 1 and 2 are blickets. Because when both 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. If 1 is removed, it turns off, even though 2 is still there. Wait, that would suggest that 1 is a blicket. But when 1 was put back, machine turned on again. So perhaps the machine turns on if at least one of the blickets is present. Or maybe it's a specific combination.\n\nWait, let's reconstruct the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put 1 on machine: light off.\n3. Put 2 on machine: light turns on. So all three on machine, light on.\n4. Take 0 off: light remains on. So 0's presence isn't necessary once others are there. So 0 is not a blicket?\n5. Take 1 off: light turns off. So with only 2 on the machine, light is off. So removing 1 caused it to turn off, implying that 1's presence is necessary. Then putting 1 back on turned the light on again (since 1 and 2 are on now). \n\nWait, when they took 1 off, machine had objects 2 and 0 (but 0 was already off from step 4). Wait, no: after step 3, all three are on. Then step 4: take 0 off, leaving 1 and 2 on. Then step 5: take 1 off, leaving only 2 on. Then the light turns off. Then step 6: put 1 back, so 1 and 2 are on, light turns on. \n\nSo when only 2 is on, light is off. When 1 and 2 are on, light is on. So maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets and both are needed. Or maybe the machine requires at least two blickets. Wait, but when 0 was on the machine with 1 and 2, the light was on. Then taking 0 off didn't affect it. So 0's presence isn't required. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if both 1 and 2 are present. So they are both blickets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when any two blickets are present. But in that case, if 1 and 2 are the only blickets, then having both on would activate it, and having just one would not. Let's see:\n\n- All three on: machine on. But removing 0 leaves 1 and 2, machine remains on. Removing 1 leaves 2, machine turns off. So 1 and 2 must both be needed. Therefore, the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. So they are both blickets. \n\nSo object 2 is a blicket because when it's on the machine along with 1, the machine is on. Removing 1 (leaving 2 alone) turns it off, which shows that 2 alone isn't sufficient. But when both are present, it's on. So their combined presence is necessary, so both are blickets. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket."}
