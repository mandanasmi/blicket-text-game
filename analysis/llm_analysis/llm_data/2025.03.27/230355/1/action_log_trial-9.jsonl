The initial setup has three objects: 0, 1, and 2, all on the floor. The machine is off.

Then they tried \"put object 0 on machine,\" which worked, but the light stayed off. Hmm, maybe the correct syntax is to use \"object X\" instead of just the number.\n\nSo the first step is to check if putting objects on the machine activates it. Let's try each object one by one. Maybe the machine only turns on when a specific combination is present. Since putting object 0 alone didn't work, maybe it's not a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one object.\n\nNext, I should try adding another object. Let's put object 1 on the machine along with object 0. If the machine turns on, that could indicate that either 0 and 1 together are blickets, or maybe one of them is a blicket and the other isn't, but the rule is different. Alternatively, maybe the rule is based on the number of blickets, like requiring exactly two.\n\nWait, but after putting object 0, the machine is still off. Let's try adding object 1 now. If the machine turns on when both 0 and 1 are on it, maybe they are both blickets. If not, maybe one of them isn't. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on if any blicket is present, but maybe some objects are non-blickets and counteract it. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be something else, like the sum of weights or specific positions, but the problem states it's about blickets. So blickets have \"blicktness\" which activates the machine. The hidden rule could be that at least one blicket is present, or all blickets must be present, or an exact number.\n\nLet's proceed step by step. After placing object 0 on the machine (successfully), the light is off. Now, add object 1. If the light turns on, then maybe both are needed. If not, maybe neither are blickets. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are present. But I need to test combinations.\n\nSo next command: put object 1 on machine.

Let me start by recalling what's happened so far.\n\nFirst, I tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the response was \"0 is not a recognized object.\" Wait, maybe I should use the full name. Then I tried \"put object 0 on machine\" and it worked. Then I put object 1 on the machine, and the light turned on. Interesting. Then I took object 0 off, but the light stayed on. Hmm.\n\nSo, when I had both object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off at first. Wait, no, when I put object 0 on, the light was still off. Then adding object 1 made it turn on. Then removing object 0 left the light on. That suggests that object 1 might be a blicket, and maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But why did adding object 1 make it turn on? Let's think.\n\nWait, initial state: all objects on the floor. After putting object 0 on machine: light off. Then object 1 added: light turns on. So maybe object 1 is a blicket. Then when I remove object 0, the light remains on because object 1 is still there. So the machine is on when any blicket is present. But maybe there's more to it. Let's test more.\n\nBut wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. Or perhaps when all blickets are on the machine. But in the steps taken, adding object 1 caused the light to turn on. So object 1 might be a blicket. Then when only object 1 is on the machine, the light stays on. So perhaps the rule is that having at least one blicket on the machine activates it. But I need to confirm.\n\nBut what about object 2? I haven't tested it yet. Let's try putting object 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, maybe object 2 isn't a blicket, or if it turns off, maybe there's a different rule. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Wait, but there are three objects. Let's consider possible rules:\n\nPossible rules:\n1. At least one blicket is on the machine.\n2. All blickets are on the machine.\n3. A specific combination (like exactly two, or a certain number).\n\nFrom the initial test: adding object 0 didn't trigger the light. Adding object 1 after that did. So object 1 is likely a blicket. Then removing 0 left 1, and the light stayed on. So the presence of 1 alone keeps it on, which supports rule 1. Now, if I take 1 off, the light should turn off. Let's try that. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, test object 2.\n\nWait, the current state after the previous commands is: object 1 is on the machine, object 0 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor. The light is on. If I take object 1 off, the light should turn off if rule 1 is correct. Let's check.\n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. But in the previous step, putting object 1 made the light turn on when object 0 was already there. But object 0 might not be a blicket. So maybe object 1 is the only blicket. Let's test that.\n\nBut perhaps I should test object 2. Let's try putting object 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, maybe 2 isn't a blicket. If the light turns off, maybe the rule is different. Alternatively, if the machine turns off when adding 2, maybe the rule is XOR or something else. Alternatively, maybe adding 2 has no effect, which would suggest it's not a blicket.\n\nSo next step: put object 2 on the machine. Let's see."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Let's recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, all objects (0, 1, 2) were on the floor. The machine was off. \n\nFirst, I tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then object 1 was added, and the machine turned on. Then when I took off object 0, the machine remained on. Then adding object 2 kept it on. Then removing object 1 left object 2 on the machine, but the machine stayed on. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, the user's previous actions:\n\n- Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n- Put object 1 on machine: light on.\n- Take object 0 off: light remains on.\n- Put object 2 on machine: light stays on.\n- Take object 1 off: light remains on (since object 2 is still there? But if the rule is that having at least one blicket activates the machine, then maybe 1 and 2 are blickets, and 0 is not. Or maybe only object 1 is a blicket, but that doesn't explain why when object 2 was added, the machine stayed on. Wait, when object 1 was removed, and only 2 was left, the machine stayed on. So that would imply that object 2 is also a blicket. Let me think step by step.\n\nWhen object 0 was placed alone, machine stayed off. So 0 is not a blicket. Then adding object 1 with 0 made it turn on. But when 0 was removed, the machine stayed on with just 1. Then adding 2 kept it on. Then removing 1, leaving 2 on, the machine stayed on. So that suggests that both 1 and 2 are blickets. Because with 1 alone, the machine is on, and 2 alone also keeps it on. Wait, but when we added 2 after 0 and 1 were on, but 0 was then removed. Wait, the sequence was:\n\nAfter putting 0 and 1 on, machine turns on. Then taking 0 off leaves 1, machine on. Then adding 2 (so now 1 and 2 are on machine), machine on. Then taking 1 off, leaving 2, machine remains on. So when 2 is alone, the machine is on. That suggests 2 is a blicket. Similarly, when 1 was alone, the machine was on. So both 1 and 2 are blickets. 0 is not.\n\nSo the rule might be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But let's check. Let me verify again:\n\n- Put 0: machine off. So 0 isn't a blicket.\n\n- Put 1: machine on. So 1 is a blicket.\n\nThen take 0 off (only 1 remains): machine stays on. Correct.\n\nThen put 2 on (so 1 and 2 on machine): machine on.\n\nThen take 1 off (only 2 remains): machine stays on. So 2 must be a blicket.\n\nTherefore, blickets are 1 and 2. The rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. But wait, another possibility: maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Wait, but when 1 was alone, it was on. So that can't be. So the rule is that having any blicket on the machine makes it turn on. So the presence of at least one blicket. But let's see if there are other possibilities. For example, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on. But in the initial setup, there are 3 objects. If all blickets must be on, then when we added 1 and 2, but 0 is not a blicket, then it would work. But when only 1 is on, the machine is on. So that would require that 1 is the only blicket. But then why adding 2 didn't affect it. Wait, no, in that case, if the rule is that all blickets must be on, then if the only blicket is 1, then putting it on would activate the machine, and adding non-blickets (like 2) doesn't matter. So possible. But how to test that?\n\nWait, but when 2 was added, the machine was already on. Then removing 1, leaving 2, the machine stayed on. So if the rule is that all blickets must be on, then if the only blicket is 1, then after removing 1, the machine should turn off. But in the user's steps, after taking 1 off (leaving 2), the machine stayed on. So that contradicts the idea that all blickets must be present. Therefore, the rule must be that the presence of at least one blicket turns it on. Thus, 1 and 2 are blickets, 0 is not. \n\nBut wait, when 0 and 1 were on, the machine turned on. But 0 is not a blicket. So putting 1 (a blicket) and 0 (non) turns it on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) keeps it on. Then adding 2 (non-blicket?) but when 2 is added, the machine stays on. Then taking 1 off (leaving 2) keeps it on. So if 2 is a blicket, that makes sense. So the blickets are 1 and 2. \n\nBut perhaps the rule is that the sum of blicktness is >= some value. But given the observations, the simplest rule is that the presence of any blicket turns it on. So the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. \n\nTo confirm, perhaps test putting 2 alone. Wait, in the previous steps, after putting 2 on when 1 was already on, then removing 1, leaving 2, the machine stayed on. So that suggests that 2 alone is sufficient, hence a blicket. \n\nSo the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. \n\nBut to make sure, maybe try putting 2 on the machine alone. Wait, but in the current state, after the last command (take object 1 off machine), the machine has object 2 on it and the light is on. So the user hasn't tested putting 2 alone from the start. Let me check the steps again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine: light off. So 0 is not a blicket.\n\n2. put object 1 on machine: light turns on. So 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. take object 0 off (leaving 1): light stays on. Correct.\n\n4. put object 2 on machine (now 1 and 2 are on): light stays on. If 2 is a blicket, adding it doesn't change, but if it's not, the presence of 1 keeps it on.\n\n5. take object 1 off (leaving 2): light stays on. So 2 must be a blicket.\n\nTherefore, both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present. \n\nBut perhaps the rule is different. For example, maybe the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present. But in that case, with 1 blicket (1), it would be on. Then adding another (2), making two, stays on. Then removing one (1), leaving 1 blicket (2), still on. So the rule could be that any number of blickets (at least one) turns it on. That's the same as the initial conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But when 2 is added, the machine remains on. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires at least two blickets. But in the case where 1 is alone, it's on. So that can't be. \n\nTherefore, the rule is that the presence of any blicket (one or more) activates the machine. And the blickets are 1 and 2. Object 0 is not a blicket.\n\nTo confirm, perhaps the user should test putting 2 on the machine alone. But in the current state, 2 is already on the machine, and the light is on. So maybe take 2 off and then put it back on. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state: object 2 is on the machine, light is on. The user just took object 1 off, leaving 2. The light is on. Now, if the user takes 2 off, the machine should turn off. Then putting 2 back on should turn it on again. That would confirm that 2 is a blicket. But the user hasn't done that yet. Let's check the steps left. The user has 32 steps, but they have used 5 steps already (the initial put 0, put 1, take 0, put 2, take 1). So maybe there are steps left. \n\nBut according to the user's previous actions, the last command was taking object 1 off, leaving 2 on the machine. The light is on. So the next step would be to take 2 off and see if the light turns off. Then put 2 back on to see if it turns on again. \n\nBut since the user has limited steps, maybe they can proceed. But in the current scenario, perhaps the user can exit early if they're confident. But maybe they need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can try putting object 0 on the machine again. If 0 is not a blicket, putting it alone should leave the machine off. \n\nBut let's think: the initial test was putting 0 alone and the machine stayed off. So 0 is not a blicket. Then putting 1 (a blicket) made it on. So the conclusion is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it."}
