Since there are three objects (0, 1, 2) all on the floor, maybe I should test each one individually first.\n\nFirst, I'll try putting object 0 on the machine. If the machine turns on, that means object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or maybe multiple objects are needed. Let's try that.\n\n> put object0 on machine\n\nHmm, after putting object0 on the machine, the light is still off. So maybe object0 isn't a blicket, or the rule requires more than one. Let me check another object. Next, I'll take object0 off and try object1.\n\n> take object0 off machine\n\nWait, but the machine was empty before, so after putting object0 on, taking it off would leave nothing. Let me just try putting object1 on next without removing object0 first. Wait, no, I should test each one alone. So maybe I should remove object0 first. Let's do that.\n\n> take object0 off machine\n\nNow the machine is empty again. Now put object1 on the machine.\n\n> put object1 on machine\n\nIf the machine still doesn't turn on, then object1 might not be a blicket either. Let's see. If it's off, then maybe object2 is the blicket. Let's test that.\n\nIf after putting object1 the light is off, take it off and try object2.\n\n> take object1 off machine\n> put object2 on machine\n\nIf the machine turns on with object2 alone, then it's a blicket. If not, then maybe the rule requires a combination. For example, maybe two objects together are needed. Let's suppose that after testing each individually and none work, the next step is to try combinations.\n\nSuppose after testing all three alone, none activate the machine. Then maybe two need to be on. Let's try putting 0 and 1 together. If that doesn't work, try 0 and 2, then 1 and 2. If any combination works, we can infer which pair might have the blickets. If all pairs don't work, then maybe all three are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on some other property, like the number of blickets being even or odd. But that's more complex. Let's start with simpler tests.\n\nWait, but the initial step limit is 32, so I need to be efficient. Testing each object alone first is a good start. Then combinations.\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. Test each object alone: put each on machine, check light. Take off after each test.\n2. If none activate alone, test pairs.\n3. If pairs don't work, test all three.\n4. Based on which combinations activate the machine, deduce the rule (e.g., AND: all blickets must be on, OR: any blicket, XOR: exactly one, etc.)\n\nLet's simulate possible outcomes.\n\nSuppose in the first tests, none of the objects alone activate the machine. Then, when we put object0 and object1 together, the machine turns on. That would suggest that at least one of them is a blicket, but since individually they didn't work, maybe the rule is that both are required (AND). Or maybe the rule is that exactly two are needed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if putting objects 0 and 1 on the machine doesn't activate it, but 0 and 2 do, then maybe one of them (0 or 2) is a blicket. Wait, but individually they didn't work. So maybe both are needed. So if 0 and 2 are both blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So if there are two blickets, both must be on. If only one is on, machine doesn't turn on.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that at least one blicket is present, but maybe there are non-blickets that interfere. But that's more complicated. Let's assume the simplest rules first.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when the total number of blickets on it is odd (XOR). But that would require knowing how many blickets there are.\n\nWait, the user said \"some of these objects are blickets\" so there's at least one. So if after testing all three alone, none work, then the rule must require more than one. So perhaps the machine requires exactly two blickets, or all of them.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's test each object alone.\n\nSo first command: put object0 on machine.\n\nIf machine doesn't activate, then take it off and try object1, then object2.\n\nIf none work alone, then next step is to try pairs.\n\nBut maybe the user's first action is to put object0 on the machine. Let's say that's the first step.\n\nAfter putting object0 on, the machine is still off. So object0 is not a blicket, or the rule requires more.\n\nThen take object0 off, put object1 on. Still off. Take off, put object2 on. Still off.\n\nNow, need to test pairs. Let's put object0 and object1 on. If machine turns on, then maybe one of them is a blicket, but the rule requires at least two? Or both are needed.\n\nAlternatively, if putting 0 and 1 doesn't activate, but 0 and 2 does, then perhaps 2 is a blicket and 0 is not, but the rule requires two objects. Wait, but that would mean that even non-blickets can activate if combined. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the rule is that at least one blicket is present, but the machine only activates if more than one object is on it. That's possible. For example, the rule could be \"if there's at least one blicket and the total number of objects on the machine is even\", but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are on it, but that would depend on how many blickets exist.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on it. So if there are two blickets, both need to be on. If three, all three.\n\nSo the strategy would be to test all possible combinations and see which ones activate the machine, then deduce the minimal set required.\n\nBut given the step limit, need to be efficient. So after testing individual objects, then pairs, then all three.\n\nAnother approach: if putting all three on the machine activates it, then the rule could be that all blickets must be present, and there are three blickets. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, the rule is that the presence of any blicket is sufficient, but when all three are on, maybe some are blickets. But that depends on the prior tests.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if exactly two blickets are present. But without knowing how many blickets there are, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if an odd number of blickets are present. But again, depends on the number.\n\nSo, the plan is to systematically test individual, pairs, and all three, then see which combinations activate the machine, then use elimination to find which objects are blickets and the rule.\n\nLet's proceed step by step."}

The machine is off.\n\nThe user first tried \"put object0 on machine\" but got an error because the command should be \"object 0\". Then they put object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. So object 0 alone doesn't activate the machine. Maybe it's not a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one object.\n\nNext step: let's try adding another object. Since object 0 didn't work alone, maybe combining it with another might trigger the machine. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine next. If the light turns on, then maybe either 0 and 1 together are blickets, or one of them is. If it doesn't, then maybe object 2 is needed. Alternatively, the rule could be different, like requiring a certain number of blickets, or a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If there are two blickets, for example, putting both on would activate it. But since there are three objects, perhaps the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. Or it's an OR condition where at least one blicket is present. But the first test with object 0 alone didn't work, so if 0 is a blicket, the rule might need more than one.\n\nHmm. Let's proceed step by step. After putting object 0 on, machine is off. Now, put object 1 on the machine. If the light turns on, then either 1 is a blicket, or the combination of 0 and 1. If it stays off, then neither 0 nor 1 alone or together are sufficient. Then we can try adding object 2.\n\nWait, but maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. So if 0 and 1 are both blickets, putting both on would activate it. If only one is a blicket, then adding another non-blicket wouldn't help. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets must be odd, or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that all objects on the machine must be blickets. So if any non-blicket is on, the machine won't activate. So if 0 is a non-blicket and 1 is a blicket, putting both on would not activate.

So if you put a non-blicket, even with a blicket, it won't activate. For example, if 0 is a non-blicket, and 1 is a blicket, putting both on would not activate the machine. Only putting 1 alone would. But the user hasn't tried that yet.\n\nWait, but the user first put 0 on and it didn't activate. Then, the next step is to add another object. Let's try that.

Then adding object 1 made it work. So maybe object 1 is a blicket. But could there be a combination here? Maybe object 0 isn't a blicket, but object 1 is. Or maybe both together activate it. Let me think. If I take one off, maybe I can test further. For example, take object 0 off the machine and see if the light stays on. If it does, then object 1 alone is a blicket, but the rule might require at least one. But wait, the light turned on when both were added. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If there are two blickets, like 1 and 2, then putting both would activate it. But I only have 1 on now. Wait, after putting 0 and 1, the machine turned on. But when I put 0 alone, it was off. So maybe the presence of object 1 is necessary. Let me check: if I remove object 0, leaving only object 1 on, does the light stay on?\n\nSo next step, take object 0 off the machine. If the light remains on, then object 1 is a blicket and the rule is that at least one blicket is needed. If the light turns off, then maybe the combination of 0 and 1 is required. Wait, but when I added object 1 to object 0, the light turned on. If object 0 isn't a blicket, then the addition of 1 (a blicket) would activate the machine if the rule is \"at least one\". But in that case, putting 1 alone should activate it. So why didn't the light turn on when I first put 0 on? Because 0 isn't a blicket. Then putting 1 on made it on. So maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. So object 1 is a blicket, and 0 isn't. But then why didn't the machine turn on when I put 1 on first? Wait, wait, no, the user input shows that after putting object 0, the light was off. Then putting object 1 made it turn on. So the first command was \"put object 0 on machine\" and the response was \"You put object 0 on the machine.

So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. Then, if object 1 is a blicket, putting it on should activate the machine even alone. But in this case, when I put 1 on after 0, the light turned on. But I need to check if 1 alone works. Wait, maybe the user didn't test that yet. Let me try to take object 0 off.\n\nSo next step: take object 0 off the machine. If the light stays on, then object 1 is a blicket and the rule is that any blicket present activates it. If the light turns off, then maybe the combination of 0 and 1 is needed, but that's unlikely because 0 alone didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine.

Let's see.\n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. So the current state is objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, light is on. Now, take object 0 off. If the light stays on, then object 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 0 and 1 are needed. But that would imply both are blickets, but when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. So that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets must be even, or some other condition. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it, and there's more than one. For example, if objects 1 and 2 are blickets, then having both on the machine would activate it. But in this case, only 1 is on. Wait, but the user hasn't tested object 2 yet. Let's try to think of possibilities.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. If object 1 is a blicket, but needs another. But when adding object 1 to object 0, the machine turned on. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, but only when paired with another. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when any blicket is present. Then, putting object 1 (a blicket) on the machine would activate it, regardless of others. So why when object 0 was on the machine alone, it didn't activate. So maybe object 1 is a blicket. Then putting 1 on the machine (even with 0) activates it. But if 0 isn't a blicket, then the presence of 1 alone should activate it. So perhaps the user made a mistake in not checking that. So the next step should be to take object 0 off and see if the light remains on. So command: take object 0 off the machine. Let's see what happens. If the light stays on, then object 1 is a blicket and the rule is at least one. If it turns off, then the combination is needed. But that's unlikely. So, next step: take object 0 off."}

So, the machine turns on when certain objects (blickets) are placed on it. My goal is to determine which ones they are and the rule governing their interaction with the machine.\n\nStarting with the initial steps: when I put object 0 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then adding object 1 made the light turn on. When I took object 0 off, the light stayed on, but removing object 1 turned it off. Then putting object 2 alone turned it on again. \n\nHmm, so object 1 and object 2 each individually can turn the machine on. Because when I put object1 alone, it turned on, and same with object2. But object0 didn't do anything when placed alone. Wait, but when I put object0 first, the light was off. Then added object1 and it turned on. Then removing object0 left the light on, but taking object1 off turned it off. That suggests that object1 is a blicket, and object0 isn't. Then object2 alone also turned it on, so maybe object2 is also a blicket. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But wait, when I had object0 and object1 together, the light was on. But when I took object0 off, leaving object1, the light stayed on. Then removing object1 turned it off. So object1 alone works, so it's a blicket. Then object2 alone works too, so it's a blicket. Object0 doesn't work alone. So maybe objects1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present. But I should test combinations to confirm.\n\nWait, but what if the rule requires exactly two blickets? Let me check. When object1 and object0 were on the machine together, the light was on. But object0 isn't a blicket. So that would mean that the presence of a blicket (object1) makes it work regardless of others. So the rule is that if at least one blicket is on the machine, it turns on. Therefore, objects1 and 2 are blickets, and object0 is not. But let me verify. If I put object0 and object2 together, would the light stay on? Because object2 is a blicket. The machine should turn on. Alternatively, if the rule is that all objects on the machine must be blickets, then putting any non-blicket would prevent activation. But when I had object0 and 1 on the machine, the light was on. Since object0 isn't a blicket, but object1 is, that suggests that the presence of at least one blicket is sufficient. So the rule is OR: any blicket present activates the machine. So the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But let me think again. When I placed object0 first, then added object1, the light turned on. Then removing object0 left the light on, which supports that. Then taking object1 off turned it off, but putting object2 on turned it on again. So each of 1 and 2 alone activate the machine. So yes, they are blickets, and the rule is that the machine needs at least one blicket. But I should check another scenario. If I put both 1 and 2 on the machine, does it stay on? Well, according to previous steps, when I put object1 and then object0, the light was on. So adding multiple blickets wouldn't change that. So probably, the rule is OR. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present. Object0 is not a blicket. So I think that's the case. But to be thorough, maybe try putting 1 and 2 together. Let me try that. So next step: put object1 on the machine again while object2 is already there. Then see if the light stays on. But since the machine is already on with object2, adding 1 might not change anything. Alternatively, perhaps the light would stay on. But since the user has limited steps, maybe I should confirm with a few more tests. But the user might have limited steps left. Let's see. So far, the steps taken are: put 0 on (off), put1 on (on), take0 off (on), take1 off (off), put2 on (on). So step 5. Now, maybe try putting 1 back on the machine while 2 is there. Let's do that. So command: put object 1 on machine. Then check if light stays on. If it does, then the rule is OR. But maybe the rule is different. Wait, but according to the previous interaction, when object0 was on (not a blicket) and object1 (blicket) was added, the light turned on. So the presence of any blicket activates the machine. Therefore, the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Therefore, objects 1 and 2 are blickets. Object0 is not. So the next command could be to exit, but maybe confirm once more. Alternatively, test object0 and 2 together. If I put object0 on the machine with object2, the machine should stay on because 2 is a blicket. So, take object2 off, then put object0 and 2 on. Let's see. But in the current state, object2 is on the machine and the light is on. If I take object2 off, the light turns off. Then put object0 and 2 on. But maybe that's too many steps. Alternatively, just check if adding object0 to the machine (which already has object2) affects the light. If I put object0 on the machine now (since object2 is already on), the light should stay on. So command: put object0 on machine. If the light remains on, that supports the OR rule. Then take object2 off, leaving object0, which should turn the light off. But this would use more steps. However, the user has 32 steps, so perhaps that's acceptable. Let's try that. Next command: put object0 on machine. The machine currently has object2, so adding object0. If the light stays on, that confirms that even with a non-blicket and a blicket, the machine is on. Then taking object2 off would leave object0, which isn't a blicket, so the light should turn off. Alternatively, if the machine turns off when non-blickets are added, that would suggest a different rule. But according to previous steps, when object0 and 1 were on (object1 is a blicket), the machine was on, so adding a non-blicket doesn't affect it. Therefore, the current step: put object0 on machine. Let's see what happens."}

Wait the steps were:\n\n- Put 0 on: light off.\n- Then put 1 on: light on.\n- Take 0 off: light remains on (so 1 alone is on).\n- Then take 1 off: light off.\n- Put 2 on: light on.\n- Then put 0 on (so 2 and 0 are on machine): light remains on.\n\nSo from this, object 1 alone activates the machine. Object 2 alone activates it. But object 0 alone doesn't. However, when object 0 is added to object 2 (machine already on), the light stays on. So maybe object 0 isn't a blicket, but objects 1 and 2 are. Because when either 1 or 2 is on the machine alone, the light is on. But when 0 is added, it doesn't affect it negatively. But wait, when you put 0 and 1 together, the machine turns on. But when you put 0 first, machine is off. Then adding 1 turns it on. So in that case, maybe the machine is on when at least one blicket is present. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, then any combination that includes at least one of them would turn it on. But let's check:\n\nObject 0 alone: off. So not a blicket.\n\nObject 1 alone: on. So it's a blicket.\n\nObject 2 alone: on. So it's a blicket.\n\nWhen 0 is added to 2 (machine already on), it stays on. So 0 doesn't interfere. So the rule might be that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. Therefore, blickets are 1 and 2. \n\nBut wait, what if the rule is different? Like, maybe all objects on the machine must be blickets. Let's test that. If the rule is \"all objects on the machine must be blickets,\" then putting a non-blicket would turn it off. But when I put 0 and 1 on, the machine was on. If 1 is a blicket and 0 is not, then according to this rule, the machine would be off because there's a non-blicket. But in the previous steps, putting 0 on first (off), then adding 1 (on). So that scenario would have machine on even with 0 (non-blicket) and 1 (blicket) on. So that contradicts the \"all must be blickets\" rule. Therefore, the rule is likely that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket present. Therefore, objects 1 and 2 are blickets. \n\nBut to confirm, maybe there's another rule. For example, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Let's see. When object 1 and 0 were on the machine, the light was on. If 1 is a blicket and 0 isn't, then two objects but only one blicket. If the rule required two, that wouldn't work. But the machine turned on. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. But in the case of object 1 alone (one blicket), it's on. So that's odd. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the machine requires the presence of a specific blicket, like either 1 or 2. So, if any of them are present, it's on. That seems to fit. So 1 and 2 are blickets, 0 is not. The rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. \n\nTo test this further, what if we put 0 and 2 on. Wait, in the log, after putting 2 on (light on), adding 0 (so 2 and 0 are on), the light stayed on. Since 2 is a blicket, the presence of 0 (non-blicket) doesn't affect it. So that supports the rule. \n\nAnother test: if we have object 1 and 2 on the machine. If the rule is at least one blicket, then the light should be on. But maybe the rule is different. However, given the current steps, we haven't tried that combination. But according to the current data, 1 and 2 each individually activate the machine, and adding non-blickets doesn't deactivate it. So the most likely conclusion is that the rule is the presence of at least one blicket, and the blickets are 1 and 2. \n\nSo the next step is to verify if there's any other possibility. Let's see. What if the machine requires exactly one blicket? Then, when you have both 1 and 2 on the machine, the light would turn off. But we haven't tested that. So perhaps that's a possibility. For example, if the rule is \"exactly one blicket\", then:\n\n- 1 alone: on.\n\n- 2 alone: on.\n\n- 1 and 2 together: off.\n\nBut we haven't tested putting both 1 and 2 on the machine. The user in the current steps hasn't done that. Let me check the log again. The user's steps were:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: off.\n\n2. Put 1 on: on.\n\n3. Remove 0: still on (1 alone).\n\n4. Remove 1: off.\n\n5. Put 2 on: on.\n\n6. Put 0 on (so 2 and 0): on.\n\nSo, to test the hypothesis that the machine requires at least one blicket, putting both 1 and 2 on should keep the light on. But if the rule is \"exactly one\", then it would turn off. So the next step could be to put 1 and 2 on the machine and see. If the light stays on, then the rule is \"at least one\". If it turns off, then \"exactly one\". But since the user hasn't done that yet, maybe that's a gap. So, perhaps I should try that. \n\nIn the current state, the machine has object 0 and 2 on it, and the light is on. So let's see. If I take object 0 and 2 off, then put 1 and 2 on. Let's plan:\n\nTake 0 off machine. Then take 2 off. Then put 1 on, then put 2 on. Then check if the light is on. \n\nBut given the step limit, perhaps the user should test that. But in the current scenario, the user has used 6 steps. They have 32, so plenty left. \n\nBut in the current step, the user just added 0 to the machine (which had 2 on it), and the light is on. So the machine has 0 and 2. So maybe the next step is to take 0 and 2 off, and then try combinations of 1 and 2. \n\nBut given that the user's goal is to find the rule and the blickets, perhaps they can stop here if they're confident. But maybe they need more info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, regardless of others. In that case, 1 and 2 are blickets, 0 is not. \n\nAnother possible rule is that the machine requires the sum of some property (like weight) of the blickets. But given the responses, it's more likely a logical OR. \n\nSo based on the existing data, the conclusion is that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. \n\nBut to confirm, the user should test putting 1 and 2 together. If the light stays on, then the rule is OR. If it turns off, then perhaps another rule. \n\nSo the next command should be to put object 1 on the machine while object 2 is already there. But currently, the machine has 0 and 2. So first, take them off. \n\nBut the current state after the last step is: object 0 and 2 are on the machine, light is on. \n\nIf the user takes object 0 off, leaving 2 (light remains on). Then put 1 on the machine. Now, machine has 2 and 1. If light stays on, supports OR. If it turns off, maybe another rule. \n\nBut according to previous steps, when adding a blicket to an already active machine, the light remains on. So adding 1 (a blicket) to 2 (blicket) should keep it on. So the light should stay on. \n\nAlternatively, if the rule is \"exactly one\", then adding 1 would make two blickets, turning it off. \n\nBut according to the user's previous steps, when they added 0 (non-blicket) to 2 (blicket), the light stayed on. So the presence of a non-blicket doesn't affect the machine's state as long as at least one blicket is present. \n\nTherefore, the next step would be to test 1 and 2 together. \n\nBut maybe the user is confident enough. But let's proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets must be odd. But in that case, having two (even) would turn it off. But again, we need to test. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the user can conclude now. But to be thorough, perhaps the next step is to take 0 off the machine (since it's there with 2), then remove 2, then put 1 and 2 together. \n\nBut since step count is limited, maybe the user can proceed. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user can exit early if they think they know. \n\nSo given the current data, the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. \n\nTherefore, the next command is to exit."}
