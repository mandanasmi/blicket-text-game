The initial description says that objects 0 and 1 are on the floor, and object 2 is on the machine. The machine's light is off. Hmm, maybe object 2 is a blicket, but the machine isn't turning on. Or maybe the rule isn't just having one blicket on the machine.\n\nFirst, I should check what happens when there's only object 2 on the machine. Since it's already there, maybe the machine isn't activating because it needs more than one blicket. Or maybe object 2 isn't a blicket. Let's try removing it to see if the machine's state changes. Wait, the machine is off now. If I take object 2 off and the machine stays off, that doesn't tell me much. But if I remove it and the machine turns on, that would be strange. But since the machine is off with object 2 on it, maybe removing it won't change anything. Alternatively, perhaps the machine requires a certain combination. Let me try putting another object on the machine.\n\nWait, maybe I should first test each object individually. So take object 2 off, then put each one on the machine one by one to see if any makes the machine activate. But since object 2 is already on the machine and the machine is off, maybe it's not a blicket. Let's take it off first. \n\nSo the first command would be 'take 2 off machine'. Then check the machine's status. If the light remains off, that doesn't help. Then put object 0 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe 0 isn't. Then repeat with object 1. But since we have limited steps, maybe a more efficient approach is needed. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. Or when at least one is on. Let's see.\n\nBut first, let's get object 2 off the machine. Then put another object on. Let's do that step by step. So first, take 2 off. Then put 0 on. Check if the machine turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 0 isn't. Then put 1 on. But maybe the rule requires multiple blickets. For example, maybe two blickets need to be on the machine. So if I put both 0 and 1 on, then see if the machine turns on. But since I have limited steps, maybe I need to test combinations.\n\nWait, the initial setup has object 2 on the machine and the machine is off. So if object 2 is a blicket, then maybe the machine requires another blicket. Let's test that. Take 2 off. Then put 0 on. If machine doesn't turn on, then put 2 back on. If machine turns on when both 0 and 2 are on, then maybe they are both blickets. Alternatively, if 2 is a blicket and 0 isn't, then having both on might not help. Hmm. Let's plan the steps:\n\n1. Take object 2 off the machine. Now all objects are on the floor. Machine is off.\n2. Put object 0 on the machine. Check status. If machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, proceed.\n3. Take 0 off. Put object 1 on. Check status. If on, then 1 is a blicket.\n4. Then test combinations.\n\nBut maybe after step 2 and 3, if neither 0 nor 1 alone activate the machine, then perhaps they need to be combined with 2. So next steps would be to put 2 back on with 0 or 1.\n\nAlternatively, if 2 is not a blicket, but the real blickets are 0 and 1. But in that case, putting both 0 and 1 on the machine should activate it. Let me try that.\n\nBut how many steps would that take? Let's outline possible commands:\n\nCurrent state: 0 and 1 on floor, 2 on machine (machine off).\n\nTake 2 off machine. Now all on floor. Machine remains off.\n\nPut 0 on machine. Check if machine turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, put 1 on machine (now 0 and 1 are on machine). Check status. If on, then maybe the rule is at least two blickets. Then determine which of 0 and 1 are blickets. But that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on it, or all of them.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when any single blicket is on it. If that's the case, then in the initial state, object 2 is on the machine, but the machine is off. So 2 is not a blicket. Then if I test 0 and 1 individually, one of them might activate the machine.\n\nSo first, take 2 off. Then put 0 on. If machine turns on, 0 is a blicket. Then take 0 off, put 1 on. If machine turns on, 1 is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine only activates when all blickets are on it. Suppose there are two blickets. Then putting both on would activate it, but not a single one.\n\nBut given the initial state, object 2 is on the machine. If 2 is not a blicket, and the real blickets are 0 and 1, then putting both on would activate the machine. But since they are on the floor now, the machine is off. So in that scenario, the machine would turn on only when both 0 and 1 are on it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine needs to be odd. But that's more complicated. Let's try simpler rules first.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst command: take 2 off the machine. Because in the initial state, 2 is on the machine, but the machine is off. So if 2 is a blicket, then the machine should have turned on. Since it didn't, maybe 2 is not a blicket. But maybe the rule requires more than one blicket. So taking 2 off and then adding others might help.\n\nSo first step:\n\n> take 2 off machine\n\nNow, all objects (0,1,2) are on the floor. Machine is off.\n\nThen, put 0 on the machine:\n\n> put 0 on machine\n\nCheck if the machine's light turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then 0 isn't. Then do the same with 1.\n\nAssuming after putting 0 on the machine, the light remains off. Then take 0 off and put 1 on.\n\nBut maybe combining 0 and 1 would help. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, if putting 0 on the machine doesn't activate it, then put 1 on as well. Let's try that.\n\nSo step 2: put 0 on machine. Machine is still off. Then step 3: put 1 on machine. Now both 0 and 1 are on the machine. Check if the light turns on. If yes, then either both are blickets, or at least one is. Need more testing.\n\nBut maybe I should check each one individually first.\n\nBut given that steps are limited, perhaps combining steps is better. Let's proceed with the first two steps as taking 2 off and putting 0 on. Then observe.\n\nIf after putting 0 on the machine, the light is still off, then 0 is not a blicket. Then put 1 on the machine (so 0 and 1 are on). If the light turns on, then either one or both are blickets. Then removing one to test.\n\nBut this requires several steps. Let's simulate possible outcomes.\n\nAssuming after putting 0 and 1 on the machine, the light turns on. Then take 0 off. If the light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then both are needed, implying both are blickets. But the rule could be \"at least one\", in which case removing one would leave the other, keeping the light on.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be \"exactly two\", but that's less likely.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step. First command:\n\n> take 2 off machine\n\nNow objects 0,1 on floor, 2 on floor. Machine off.\n\nSecond command:\n\n> put 0 on machine\n\nIf machine remains off, then 0 is not a blicket. Then third command: put 1 on machine. If machine turns on, then at least one of them is a blicket. Then take 0 off. If light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If light turns off, then 0 was the blicket.\n\nBut let's see. Suppose after putting 0 on, machine is off. Then put 1 on. Machine turns on. Then take 0 off. If machine stays on, 1 is a blicket. If turns off, both are needed.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's proceed with actual commands.\n\nAfter taking 2 off, putting 0 on, and if machine is still off, then next step would be to put 1 on. Let's see.\n\nBut first, let's execute the first two steps:\n\n1. take 2 off machine\n2. put 0 on machine\n\nIf after these, the machine's light is still off, then 0 is not a blicket. Then:\n\n3. put 1 on machine\n\nIf the machine turns on, then at least one of 0 or 1 is a blicket. Then we need to test which.\n\nBut maybe the machine's rule is that both blickets must be present. So if both 0 and 1 are on, then it activates. But in that case, if they are both blickets, removing either would turn it off. So testing that would help.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that at least one blicket is present, then if either 0 or 1 is a blicket, the machine would activate when either is on.\n\nBut given that in the initial state, 2 was on the machine and it was off, perhaps 2 is not a blicket. So maybe 0 and/or 1 are the blickets.\n\nSo after putting 0 and 1 on the machine, if the machine turns on, then at least one of them is a blicket. Then, take one off to see.\n\nFor example, take 0 off. If the machine remains on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 0 was the blicket.\n\nBut this requires several steps. Let's proceed.\n\nAssuming after step 2 (put 0 on machine), machine is still off. Then step 3: put 1 on machine. If the machine turns on, then step 4: take 0 off. Observe.\n\nIf after removing 0, the machine remains on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then both 0 and 1 are needed, meaning both are blickets. So the rule would be that all blickets must be on the machine. But how many blickets are there?\n\nAlternatively, if after putting both 0 and 1 on the machine, the machine turns on, but removing either turns it off, then the rule is that all blickets must be present. So if both are blickets, then the machine needs both. If only one is a blicket, then putting both on would mean the machine is on when the blicket is on, regardless of the other. So this could be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which. But that's a different rule. But the initial state had one object (2) on the machine, and it was off. So the rule can't be exactly one. So maybe two or more. But in that case, putting two objects (like 0 and 1) on would activate it. But then the blickets might be irrelevant, which contradicts the problem statement. So the rule must involve blickets.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. So if 0 is a blicket, putting it on alone would activate. If not, then putting 1 on would. If neither, then even with both on, machine stays off. But since the machine was off with 2 on, maybe 2 isn't a blicket. So perhaps 0 and 1 are the candidates.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nAssuming after step 3 (put 1 on machine), the machine turns on. Then step 4: take 0 off. If the machine stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 0 was the blicket. Then step 5: put 0 back on and take 1 off. If machine turns off, then 0 is the blicket.\n\nAlternatively, if after putting 0 and 1 on, machine is on, but taking either off doesn't turn it off, then the rule might be that the machine is activated by any number of blickets, but there's a delay. But that's unlikely.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. Suppose there's only one blicket. So either 0 or 1. Let's test each individually.\n\nAfter taking 2 off, put 0 on. If machine on: 0 is blicket. Else, take 0 off, put 1 on. If machine on: 1 is blicket. If neither, then both must be on. But that would mean two blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. So if there are two, and both are on the machine, it activates. If only one, it doesn't. But then if putting both 0 and 1 on activates the machine, then both are blickets.\n\nBut how do we know how many blickets there are? The problem says \"some\" of the objects are blickets. So at least one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. So if there are two blickets among the three, putting two on would activate. But again, the initial state has 2 on the machine, which didn't activate, so 2 isn't a blicket. Then maybe 0 and 1 are blickets, and putting both on would activate the machine.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too hypothetical. Let's proceed with actual commands.\n\nFirst step: take 2 off. Now all on floor. Machine off.\n\nSecond: put 0 on. Machine off. So 0 isn't a blicket.\n\nThird: take 0 off. Put 1 on. Machine off. So 1 isn't a blicket. Then, putting both 0 and 1 on. Machine on. Then they must both be blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine.\n\nBut in this case, if both are blickets, then the machine would require both to be on. So if you put both on, it activates. If either is missing, it turns off.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present, but both 0 and 1 are not blickets. Then maybe 2 is a blicket, but the machine's activation depends on something else, like weight or position. But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when no blickets are on it. But that contradicts the problem statement, which says blickets make the machine turn on.\n\nSo this is tricky. Let's try to outline possible steps again.\n\nInitial state: 0 and 1 on floor, 2 on machine. Machine off.\n\nTake 2 off: all on floor. Machine remains off.\n\nPut 0 on machine. Check status. If machine on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, proceed.\n\nAssume it's off. Then put 1 on machine. Now 0 and 1 are on. Machine on? If yes, then either one or both are blickets.\n\nTake 0 off. If machine remains on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 0 was the blicket. Then put 0 back on and take 1 off. If machine turns off, then 1 was the blicket.\n\nAlternatively, if both 0 and 1 are needed, then the rule is that all blickets must be present.\n\nBut this requires multiple steps. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo after taking 2 off:\n\n> take 2 off machine\n\nThen:\n\n> put 0 on machine\n\nIf the machine remains off, then:\n\n> put 1 on machine\n\nNow, if machine turns on, then:\n\n> take 0 off machine\n\nIf machine stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 0 is a blicket.\n\nThen, to confirm, put 0 back on, take 1 off. If machine turns off, then 1 was the blicket.\n\nBut this is getting into a lot of steps. Let's see how many steps this would take. Taking 2 off (1), putting 0 on (2), putting 1 on (3), taking 0 off (4), putting 0 back on (5), taking 1 off (6). That's six steps, but we have 32, so it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if after putting both 0 and 1 on, the machine turns on, and taking either off turns it off, then both are blickets and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine.\n\nBut the problem states that \"some\" objects are blickets, so it's possible to have two.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. Let's consider that the initial state has 2 on the machine, machine off. So 2 is not a blicket. So the possible blickets are 0 and 1.\n\nIf putting both on activates the machine, then both are blickets, and the rule is that all must be on. If putting either alone doesn't, but both do, then that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, if putting either 0 or 1 alone activates the machine, then the rule is at least one. But since in the initial state, 2 was on and the machine was off, 2 is not a blicket.\n\nBut let's proceed with the commands.\n\nFirst command: take 2 off the machine.\n\nSecond command: put 0 on the machine. Observe machine's state.\n\nAssuming after putting 0 on, machine is still off. Third command: put 1 on. Now both 0 and 1 are on. If machine turns on, then possible both are blickets, or at least one is.\n\nFourth command: take 0 off. If machine turns off, then 0 is a blicket. Fifth command: put 0 back on. Sixth command: take 1 off. If machine turns off, then 1 is a blicket.\n\nIf both steps 4 and 6 result in the machine turning off, then both are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If only one of them causes the machine to turn off, then that one is the blicket.\n\nAlternatively, if after step 3 (both 0 and 1 on), the machine is on, but removing either leaves it on, then the rule might be that the presence of any blicket activates it, and both are blickets. But that seems unlikely because removing one would still leave the other, keeping the machine on. But that would require both being blickets. However, if only one is a blicket, then removing the non-blicket wouldn't affect the machine. But if you remove the blicket, it turns off.\n\nSo in that case, if after putting both on, machine is on, then:\n\n- Take 0 off. If machine stays on, then 1 is the blicket. If it turns off, then 0 is the blicket.\n\n- Similarly, take 1 off. If machine stays on, then 0 is the blicket.\n\nThis would help determine which one is the blicket.\n\nBut perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. So putting either 0 or 1 (if they are blickets) would activate it. But in the initial step, putting 0 on alone didn't activate it, so 0 isn't a blicket. Then putting 1 on alone would activate if it's a blicket. But if neither activates alone, then both must be blickets.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Let's proceed with the commands step by step.\n\nFirst command: take 2 off machine.\n\nSecond command: put 0 on machine.\n\nAssuming machine remains off. Then:\n\nThird command: put 1 on machine. Now 0 and 1 are on.\n\nIf machine turns on, then:\n\nFourth command: take 0 off. If machine stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 0 is a blicket.\n\nBut let's assume that after step 3, machine turns on. Then take 0 off (step 4). If machine stays on, then 1 is a blicket. Then take 1 off (step 5) to see if machine turns off, confirming it. If so, then 1 is the blicket. Then the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket activates the machine.\n\nAlternatively, if after step 4, machine turns off, then 0 is a blicket, and 1 is not. Then putting 0 back on (step 5) would turn the machine on again.\n\nBut this is all dependent on the actual outcomes. Let's proceed with the first few commands to gather data."}

Then I took object 2 off, and the light stayed off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, and the light turned on. When I removed object 0, the light went off again. Then I put object 1 on, and the light turned on again. \n\nWait, so both object 0 and object 1 individually make the machine turn on when placed alone. That suggests that each of them might be a blicket. But what about object 2? Initially, object 2 was on the machine, but the light was off. So when it was the only one on the machine, it didn't activate it. So maybe object 2 isn't a blicket. \n\nBut maybe the rule isn't just having at least one blicket on the machine. Maybe there's a different rule. For example, maybe the machine turns on if an even number of blickets are present, or something like that. But in the initial state, only object 2 was on the machine, and it was off. Then adding object 0 (a possible blicket) turned it on. Then removing object 0 turned it off. Then adding object 1 (another possible blicket) turned it on. So if both 0 and 1 are blickets, then each alone activates the machine, which would suggest the rule is \"at least one blicket is on the machine\". \n\nBut let's test object 2. Let me try putting object 2 on the machine again to see if it does anything. If I put object 2 on the machine now, maybe combined with another object. For example, if I put 0 and 2 on together, does the light stay on? Or if 2 is a non-blicket, adding it with a blicket would still keep the light on. Alternatively, maybe the rule requires exactly one blicket. But when I had object 0 alone, it worked, and object 1 alone, so maybe both are blickets. \n\nBut wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is present. But if both 0 and 1 are blickets, then putting both on the machine would turn it off. Let me test that.\n\nRight now, after putting object 1 on the machine, the light is on. If I add object 0 to the machine (so both 0 and 1 are on it), what happens? If the rule is \"exactly one blicket\", then the light would turn off. If it's \"at least one\", then it stays on. So that's a key test. Alternatively, if the rule is \"all objects on the machine must be blickets\", then putting 0 and 1 (both blickets) would keep it on, but adding a non-blicket (like 2) would turn it off. \n\nSo let's try adding object 0 to the machine when object 1 is already there. The current state is object 1 is on the machine, light is on. If I put object 0 on, the machine would have both 0 and 1. If the light stays on, then the rule could be \"at least one\" or \"all\". But if it turns off, maybe the rule is \"exactly one\" or \"exclusive OR\". \n\nAlternatively, if the rule is \"exactly two blickets\", but that seems less likely given previous results. \n\nSo the next step is to test adding object 0 to the machine when object 1 is already there. Let me do that. If the light stays on, then maybe the rule is \"at least one\", but if it turns off, maybe something else. \n\nBut wait, in the initial state, object 2 was alone on the machine, light off. So 2 isn't a blicket. Then 0 alone makes it on, 1 alone makes it on. So if both 0 and 1 are blickets, adding them both should keep the light on if the rule is \"any number >=1\". But if the rule is \"exactly one\", then adding another would turn it off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the total number of blickets is odd. But in that case, one is odd, two is even, three is odd. But let's see. \n\nSo let me try putting object 0 on the machine while object 1 is already there. Let's see what happens."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine's light turns on when certain objects (blickets) are placed on it, but the exact rule isn't clear yet.\n\nInitially, the setup was: objects 0 and 1 on the floor, object 2 on the machine. Then when I took object 2 off the machine, the light was off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, and the light turned on. Taking object 0 off made it turn off again. Then putting object 1 on made the light come on. Then adding object 0 again kept the light on. \n\nWait, so when I put object 0 alone on the machine, the light was on. Same with object 1. Then when both 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light stayed on. Does that mean that either object 0 or 1 is a blicket? But if both are blickets, then maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. But when I had object 2 on the machine initially, the light was off. So object 2 isn't a blicket. Because when it was on the machine alone, the light was off. Then when I removed it, then added 0 and 1, the light came on. \n\nSo far, the experiments suggest that objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and object 2 is not. Because placing either 0 or 1 alone activates the machine. Also, putting both 0 and 1 together keeps it on. The machine's rule might be that at least one blicket is present. But let me check more possibilities. \n\nWait, when I put object 0 on the machine first, the light turned on. Then I took it off, and the light went off. Then putting object 1 on made it turn on again. Then adding object 0 again (so both 0 and 1 are on the machine) the light stayed on. So each of them individually activates the machine. That would imply that both are blickets. Because each alone is sufficient to turn the machine on. So the rule is that the presence of any blicket will activate the machine. So the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. \n\nBut I should also test if having both together does anything. Wait, when I added object 0 again after putting object 1 on, the light was already on. So perhaps the rule is simply that having any number of blickets (at least one) turns it on. \n\nBut maybe there's a different rule. For example, the machine might require exactly two blickets, but that's not the case here because each alone works. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. But since there are two blickets (0 and 1), but when each is placed alone, the machine turns on, that can't be. So the rule must be that at least one blicket is present. \n\nWait, but maybe the machine's state is based on the sum of some property. But given that each of 0 and 1 alone activates it, the simplest explanation is that each is a blicket, and the rule is that any blicket present turns the machine on. \n\nBut let's consider another scenario. Suppose that the rule is that the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are present. If 0 and 1 are blickets, then each alone (1) is odd, so on. Both together (2) is even, so off. But in the last step, when both 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light stayed on. So that contradicts that. Therefore, the rule isn't odd number. So the initial conclusion seems more plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But when both 0 and 1 are on, the light is on. So that would mean the rule is at least one. \n\nSo the possible conclusions are: objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. Object 2 is not a blicket. \n\nBut to confirm, I should test putting object 2 on the machine. Wait, initially, object 2 was on the machine and the light was off. So that's why taking it off didn't change anything. Then when I put 0 on, it turned on. Then taking 0 off turned it off. Then putting 1 on turned it on again. So 2 is definitely not a blicket. So the next step is to test putting object 2 back on the machine with either 0 or 1. \n\nWait, the user hasn't done that yet. So far, the steps taken are:\n\n1. Took object 2 off machine. Light off.\n2. Put object 0 on machine. Light on.\n3. Took object 0 off. Light off.\n4. Put object 1 on. Light on.\n5. Put object 0 on. Light on.\n\nSo now, the machine has both 0 and 1 on it. Light is on. So if the rule is that any blicket is present, then both being on is fine. If the rule was that exactly one is needed, then the light would turn off when adding the second, but that's not the case here. \n\nBut perhaps the user hasn't tested object 2 at all. Maybe object 2 is a blicket but requires a certain condition. For example, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But in the initial state, object 2 was on the machine alone, and the light was off. So if 2 were a blicket, then the machine should have been on. But it wasn't, so 2 isn't a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. But in that case, putting 0 and 1 on would activate it, but putting either alone wouldn't. But the user saw that putting 0 alone activated it, so that can't be. \n\nSo the conclusion is that 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. \n\nBut to confirm, maybe try putting 2 on the machine along with another object. For example, if 2 is not a blicket, then putting it with 0 should keep the light on. But if 2 is a blicket, then putting it with 0 might affect the outcome. \n\nThe user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step could be to test object 2. For example, put 2 on the machine along with 0 or 1. \n\nBut the user's last action was putting 0 on the machine when 1 was already there. The light stayed on. So the machine has both 0 and 1 on it. The light is on. Now, maybe take 0 off and see if the light stays on. Wait, but when the user took 0 off earlier (step 3), the light went off. Then putting 1 on turned it on. So taking 0 off now would leave 1 on, so light should stay on. \n\nAlternatively, maybe take 1 off now and see if 0 alone is still on. But maybe that's redundant. \n\nAnother approach: if the user wants to confirm that 2 isn't a blicket, they could put 2 on the machine alone. Let's see:\n\nIf I put object 2 on the machine now, the current state is that 0 and 1 are on the machine. If I take them off, and put 2 on, the light should stay off. But maybe the user needs to check that. \n\nSo possible next steps:\n\nTake object 0 off, leaving object 1 on. Then check if light is still on. Then take object 1 off, put 2 on. Check light. \n\nBut the user has limited steps (32), so efficiency is key. \n\nAlternatively, since the user has already determined that 0 and 1 each activate the machine alone, and 2 does not when alone, the conclusion is likely that 0 and 1 are blickets, rule is at least one. But maybe the rule is that both must be present. Wait, when the user first put 0 on, light on. Then took 0 off, put 1 on, light on. Then added 0 again. So in that case, both are on. But the light was already on when 1 was on. So adding 0 didn't change it. But if the rule required both, then putting only 0 or only 1 wouldn't activate it. But that's not the case here. \n\nWait, but the user saw that putting 0 on alone turned the light on, which contradicts the rule requiring both. So the rule must be at least one. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. \n\nBut to confirm, maybe test putting object 2 on with another object. For example, put 2 and 0 on. If the light is on, that confirms that 2 isn't a blicket because 0 is sufficient. If the light is off, then maybe there's a different rule. \n\nBut given the steps left, perhaps it's better to conclude now. The user has already done enough tests. So the next step could be to exit."}
