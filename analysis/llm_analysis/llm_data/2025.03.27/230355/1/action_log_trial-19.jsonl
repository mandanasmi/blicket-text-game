Let me start by understanding the setup. There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2, all on the floor. The machine is off. My goal is to test different combinations of these objects on the machine to see when it activates.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try putting one object on the machine at a time. Let's start with object 0. If I put it on the machine and the light turns on, then 0 might be a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. But I have to remember that the rule could require more than one object. Let me try that.\n\nSo, command: put object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens. If the light turns on, that's a clue. If not, then maybe the rule is something else, like needing two objects. Then I can add another object and test again. After each step, I need to check the machine's status. If the light doesn't come on with one object, maybe I need to try combinations. Also, perhaps removing an object could affect it. For example, if the machine is on with two objects, taking one off might turn it off, indicating that both are required. But I should proceed step by step.\n\nWait, the initial state is all objects on the floor. Let me start by testing each object individually. So first, put object 0 on machine. Check the light. If it's on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe not. Then take 0 off, put 1 on, check. Then same with 2. If none of them individually activate the machine, then the rule might be that two or more are needed. Then I can test pairs: 0 and 1, 0 and 2, 1 and 2. If that works, maybe any two. If not, maybe a specific pair. Then test all three together. Also, maybe the rule is that the total number of blickets on the machine is a certain number, or maybe an OR/AND condition. \n\nAlternatively, the rule could be based on weight, but since the problem mentions \"blicketness\" as a property, it's likely a logical combination. For example, the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present (OR), all blickets are present (AND), or a specific combination. \n\nAnother approach is to test all possible combinations systematically. But since there are 3 objects, the possible subsets are 2^3 -1 =7 non-empty subsets. But since steps are limited (32), but that's more than enough. However, maybe there's a smarter way. \n\nSuppose I start with individual tests. If none activate, then try pairs. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst action: put object 0 on the machine. Then check the light. If the light is still off, then 0 is not a blicket (assuming the rule requires at least one blicket). Then put 0 back on the floor, try 1. Same for 2. If none work alone, then try combinations. Let's start with that."}

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine's light is off initially. When I put object 0 on the machine, nothing happened. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. Hmm.\n\nSo, possible rules: Maybe the machine requires at least two blickets to activate. But when I put object 0 alone, the light stayed off. Then adding object 1 made it turn on. So either both 0 and 1 are blickets (so two needed), or maybe object 1 alone is a blicket. Wait, but when I put 0 on, the machine was off. Then adding 1 made it on. So if 1 is a blicket, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present. But then, putting 1 alone should turn it on. Wait, maybe I need to test that.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if object 1 alone would activate the machine. Let's see. But right now, both 0 and 1 are on the machine. So maybe I need to take object 0 off and see if the machine stays on. Wait, but the machine's current state is on. If I take off object 0, and the light stays on, that would mean that object 1 is sufficient. If it turns off, then both are needed.\n\nSo next step: take object 0 off the machine. Let's see what happens.\n\nBut first, let me recap. Steps so far:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put 1 on machine: light on.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n- Rule is \"exactly two blickets\": So 0 and 1 are both blickets. But then, if 0 is a blicket, why didn't it turn on when only 0 was present? Because it needs exactly two? Or maybe the rule is \"at least one\", but 0 is not a blicket and 1 is. Then when I added 1, it turned on. So maybe 1 is a blicket. But then, putting 1 alone should turn it on. Wait, but when I put 0 first, then 1, maybe the order matters. Maybe the machine only checks when you add an object. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's state updates each time you add or remove an object. So when I put 0 on, machine checks if the current set (only 0) satisfies the rule. It didn't. Then adding 1, the set becomes 0 and 1. Then the machine checks again and turns on. So the rule could be that having at least one blicket, and 1 is a blicket, but 0 is not. Because then adding 1 would make the machine have a blicket, thus turning on. But in that case, if I had put 1 first, it would have turned on immediately. But maybe the user didn't try that. Let me check the previous steps.\n\nWait, in the user's actions, they first put 0 on the machine, light off. Then put 1 on, light on. So the machine turned on when 1 was added. So maybe the rule is that the presence of any blicket makes the machine turn on. Therefore, 1 is a blicket, and 0 is not. Because adding 1 (a blicket) caused the machine to turn on. But why didn't putting 1 alone first turn it on? Because the user didn't try that yet. They started with 0. So maybe the next step is to test if putting 1 alone turns it on. But to do that, they would need to remove 0 and 1 and try again. However, steps are limited. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when there's an even number of blickets, or something else. But the simplest explanation is that the presence of at least one blicket activates the machine, and 1 is a blicket, 0 is not. But to confirm, they need to check if 1 alone works.\n\nSo the next logical step is to remove object 0 and see if the machine stays on. If it does, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then both 0 and 1 are needed, which would mean the rule is that both must be present. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent state: objects 0 and 1 are on the machine. Light is on.\n\nSo the command would be 'take object 0 off the machine'. If after that the light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the presence of both 0 and 1 is required.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine updates its state when objects are added or removed. So taking 0 off would leave only 1. If the light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then perhaps the rule is that both are needed. But maybe the machine's state is re-evaluated whenever there's a change. So when you take 0 off, it checks again. If 1 is a blicket, then even alone, the light should stay on. If the rule is that at least two blickets are needed, then removing 0 (if it's a blicket) would bring the count down to one, turning off the light. But if the rule is that any blicket is sufficient, then 1 alone would keep it on.\n\nSo let's simulate:\n\nAfter taking 0 off, if the light remains on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the combination of 0 and 1 is needed. But that would mean both are blickets, and the rule is that at least two are present. But that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed, and both 0 and 1 are blickets. But then, when only 0 is present, it's not enough. When both are there, it works. But then, if you take one off, it would stop.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo the next command should be to take object 0 off the machine. Let's see the result."}

So far, I know that when I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light turned on. Then I took object 0 off, and the light stayed on. But when I took object 1 off, the light turned off. Hmm.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light was off. Then when I added object 1, it turned on. So maybe object 1 is a blicket, and object 0 isn't. Then, taking object 0 off didn't affect the light, which was still on with just object 1. Then removing object 1 turned it off. So maybe object 1 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. But what about object 2? I haven't tested that yet.\n\nLet me test object 2. If I put object 2 on the machine alone, does the light turn on? If it does, then maybe object 2 is also a blicket. If not, then maybe only object 1 is. But let's check. Alternatively, maybe the rule requires more than one blicket. Wait, when I had both 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 left 1 on, and the light stayed on. Removing 1 turned it off. So object 1 must be a blicket. But what about when I had only 0 on the machine? The light was off. So 0 isn't a blicket.

Need to test.\n\nLet's try putting object 2 on the machine alone. If the light turns on, then it's a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. Then, if I add object 1 to it, see if the light stays on or changes. Also, what if I put all three on? Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, check object 2 alone. So command: put object 2 on the machine. Let's see. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, maybe not. Then, maybe combine with others.\n\nWait, but maybe the rule is more complex. Like, an OR condition (any blicket), or AND (all blickets). But in the previous case, putting 0 and 1 on, the light turned on. Then, taking 0 off, leaving 1 (a blicket), light stays on. So OR. Because if it's AND, then removing one would turn it off. But since it stayed on, it's OR. So the presence of at least one blicket activates the machine.\n\nSo object 1 is a blicket.

Let me do that.\n\nSo next step: put object 2 on the machine. Let's see the result. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe only 1 is.

Because when they're on the machine alone, the light is on. But object 0 doesn't do anything even when placed alone. Wait, but when I put object 0 and 1 together, the light turned on. Then when I removed 0, leaving 1, it stayed on. Then removing 1 turned it off. So that suggests that 1 is a blicket. Then putting 2 alone made it turn on, so 2 is also a blicket. Object 0 didn't activate it alone, so probably not a blicket. \n\nSo the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. Since 1 and 2 individually activate it, they are blickets. The machine requires at least one blicket to be present. But let me check another combination to confirm. What if I put 0 and 2 on the machine? If 0 isn't a blicket, but 2 is, then the machine should turn on. But maybe I should test that. Let's try putting 0 and 2 on the machine. Wait, but the current state is object 2 is on the machine and the light is on. If I add object 0, does it stay on? But the user has to act step by step. Let me see the previous steps. The last action was putting object 2 on the machine, and the light is on. So now, maybe I should take object 2 off, then try adding 0 and 2 together. But I need to do that step by step. Let me think: Since the machine is on with 2 alone, if I add 0, the machine should stay on. But maybe the rule is that the presence of any blicket activates it. So 0 isn't a blicket, but 1 and 2 are. So the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 2. But to confirm, maybe test putting 0 and 2 together. Let me try that. But how? Let's proceed step by step. Right now, object 2 is on the machine. If I take it off, the machine turns off. Then put 0 and 2 on. Let's see:\n\nTake 2 off: light goes off. Then put 0 on: light stays off. Then put 2 on: light turns on. So 0 doesn't contribute. Therefore, 2 is a blicket. Similarly, 1 is a blicket. So the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present. So the answer would be blickets 1 and 2, rule: machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But maybe there's another rule, like exactly two blickets. But no, when 1 or 2 alone are on, the machine is on. So the rule is OR. So I think that's it. But maybe I should check if combining 1 and 2. Let's see. If 1 and 2 are both on the machine, the light is on. But that's consistent with the OR rule. So the conclusion is 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is at least one must be on the machine. So I can exit now."}
