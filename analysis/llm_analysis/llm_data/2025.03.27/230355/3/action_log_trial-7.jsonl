I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine's light is off right now. The objects are 0, 1, and 2. Object 1 is already on the machine, while 0 and 2 are on the floor.\n\nFirst, maybe I should check if the machine is currently active. Since the light is off, maybe having object 1 alone isn't enough. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one blicket. Alternatively, the rule could be different, like needing a certain combination or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by testing each object individually. But since object 1 is already on the machine and the light is off, that suggests that object 1 alone isn't a blicket, or the rule isn't just having any blicket. So perhaps the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, or a certain number of them.\n\nBut there are three objects. Let's see. If I take object 1 off and put another object on, maybe. Let me try to take object 1 off and see what happens. Wait, but taking it off might not change anything if it wasn't contributing. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when certain combinations are present.\n\nWait, maybe the current state is that the machine is off with object 1 on it. So if object 1 isn't a blicket, then putting another object on might help. Let me try putting object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens. If the machine turns on, then either 0 is a blicket, or maybe both 0 and 1 are needed. But wait, if I put 0 on, then both 0 and 1 are on the machine. So if the machine turns on, maybe the rule is that both need to be on. But then I need to check if each is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. Or maybe it's a specific combination.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial setup is a clue. Since object 1 is on the machine and the machine is off, maybe object 1 is not a blicket. So perhaps the blickets are among 0 and 2. Let me try putting object 0 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. But if it doesn't, maybe I need to combine with others.\n\nSo first step: put object 0 on the machine. Let's see.\n\nWait, but before that, maybe I should check the current state. The machine has object 1 on it. So maybe I should take object 1 off first and see if that changes anything. If I take object 1 off and the machine is still off, that's no change. But maybe putting another object on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine only activates when certain objects are on. So perhaps test each object one by one.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, take object 1 off the machine. Then, the machine is empty. Then put object 0 on. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe try object 2.\n\nSo, first command: take 1 off machine. Then, the machine has nothing. Then put 0 on. If machine light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, try 2.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is object 1 on machine, machine off. So maybe 1 is not a blicket. Let's check that.\n\nSo maybe the first step is to take object 1 off the machine, then see the machine's state. But if I take it off, the machine is empty, so the light remains off. Then I can start testing each object alone.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nCommand 1: take 1 off machine.\n\nThen, machine is empty. Then put 0 on. Check if machine turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. Then remove 0, put 1 on, check. Then put 2 on, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets. So if I put 0 and 2 on, maybe that would activate it.\n\nBut since I have limited steps (32), I need to plan efficiently.\n\nWait, let's think about possible rules. Common rules could be:\n\n- At least one blicket is on the machine (but in this case, if 1 is a blicket, the machine should be on. But it's off, so 1 is not a blicket. Then maybe 0 and/or 2 are.)\n\n- All blickets must be on the machine (if there are two blickets, both must be on).\n\n- The number of blickets on the machine must be even, or odd.\n\n- The machine activates when a specific combination is present.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on it. But in that case, since object 1 is on it and the machine is off, 1 is not a blicket. Then, putting another object (like 0) would test if it's a blicket.\n\nSo, the first step is to take object 1 off, then try each object alone.\n\nBut maybe I should first check if the machine can activate with object 1 alone. But since it's already on, and the machine is off, that suggests that 1 isn't a blicket. So taking it off is unnecessary for testing. Alternatively, maybe the machine's state changes when the configuration changes. Wait, but the initial description says the machine's light is off. So, maybe the current state is that with object 1 on, machine is off. So 1 is not a blicket. Then the other objects (0 and 2) might be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on. Suppose there are two blickets. Then, if 0 and 2 are blickets, putting both on would activate the machine.\n\nBut let's start with individual tests.\n\nSo, step 1: take 1 off the machine. Now, the machine is empty. Then, put 0 on. Check if the light turns on. If yes, 0 is a blicket. If not, then 0 is not. Then take 0 off, put 2 on. Check. Then maybe combinations.\n\nBut I need to issue commands step by step. So first, I need to take 1 off. Let's do that.\n\nCommand: take 1 off machine.\n\nNow, the machine has nothing on it. Then, put 0 on. Command: put 0 on machine. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then it's not. Then take 0 off, put 2 on. So perhaps that's the next steps.\n\nAlternatively, after taking 1 off, maybe the machine's state remains off. Then putting 0 on. Let's see.\n\nBut in the initial setup, after taking 1 off, the machine is empty. Then, putting 0 on. If the machine turns on, 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 0 is not. Then put 2 on. But if after putting 0 on, the machine is still off, then maybe 0 isn't a blicket, and then I can add 2 to see if both together activate.\n\nWait, but if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then if 0 and 2 are both blickets, putting both on would activate it. So after testing each alone (if they don't activate), then putting both on would be a test.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that any blicket activates the machine, but only if placed alone. But that's less likely.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step. First, take 1 off.\n\n> take 1 off machine"}

The machine's light was off initially. Object 1 was on the machine, but taking it off made the light stay off. Then putting object 0 on the machine turned the light on. So maybe object 0 is a blicket. But I need to test other possibilities to confirm the rule.\n\nWait, when object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket. But I should check if other objects also cause the machine to activate when placed. Maybe the rule is that any single blicket activates the machine. Or maybe it's a combination. Let me test other objects.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens if I remove object 0. If I take it off, does the light turn off? If yes, that confirms object 0 is a blicket. Then I can test other objects. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket, but maybe more than one?\n\nLet's try taking object 0 off now. The machine's light is on. If I take it off, the light should turn off if object 0 is the only blicket. Let's try that.\n\nWait, but the user can't input multiple commands here. So next step: take object 0 off. Let me see the result. Then maybe test other objects like 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is different. Maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. If there are multiple blickets, maybe they all need to be on. But since object 0 alone made it work, maybe it's an OR condition. But I need to check others.\n\nSo first, after putting object 0 on the machine and the light is on, maybe take it off again. Then try putting object 1 on. If the light doesn't turn on, then object 1 isn't a blicket. Then try object 2. If the light turns on with 2, then 2 is a blicket. Otherwise, only 0 is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of weights or some other property. But given the initial setup, the simplest rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. So need to test each object.\n\nSo current state: object 0 is on the machine, light is on. Let's take object 0 off. Then the machine's light should turn off. Then try putting object 1 on. If light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then 1 isn't. Then same with 2.\n\nWait, but initially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off. Then taking it off didn't change anything. So when object 1 was on the machine, light was off, which suggests that object 1 is not a blicket. Because when it was alone on the machine, the light was off. Then when object 0 was added, light turned on. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, and 1 and 2 are not. But need to test object 2 as well.\n\nSo next step: take object 0 off. Then put object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 0 is the only one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is more complex. For example, the machine requires exactly two blickets. But when object 0 was placed alone, light turned on. So that's probably not. Or maybe the number of blickets is even. But again, the initial test suggests that 0 is a blicket.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent step after putting object 0 on the machine: light is on. Now, take object 0 off.\n\n> take object 0 off the machine\n\nBut after that, the light would turn off. Then put object 1 on. If light stays off, then 1 is not a blicket. Then put object 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. Otherwise, only 0 is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combinations matter. For example, both 0 and 2 need to be on. But that's more complicated. Let's test each object individually.\n\nSo first, take object 0 off.\n\nThen put object 1 on. If light stays off, then 1 isn't a blicket. Then put object 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then 0 is the only one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is on it. But again, that's speculation.\n\nWait, but the initial state had object 1 on the machine, and light was off. So when object 1 was alone, the light was off. So that suggests that 1 is not a blicket. Then when object 0 was added (but wait, no, when the user first took 1 off, then put 0 on. So in that case, the machine was empty except for 0. Then the light turned on. So that suggests that 0 is a blicket. But we need to test 2 as well.\n\nSo after removing 0, the light should be off. Then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. Otherwise, only 0 is.\n\nSo next steps:\n\nTake object 0 off the machine. Light turns off. Then put object 2 on. Observe.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nSo the user's next command should be to take object 0 off, then put 2 on. But each step is a single command. So the next command after putting 0 on and light is on is to take 0 off.\n\nSo first command: take object 0 off the machine.\n\nThen look to see if the light is off. Then put object 2 on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after taking 0 off, the light is off. Then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then 0 is the only one.\n\nBut let's proceed."}

Taking object 0 off turned it off again. Then putting object 2 on the machine turned it on, and adding object 1 to the machine kept it on. Now, both objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, and the light is on.\n\nWait, but when I first put object 0 on alone, the machine turned on. Then when I put object 2 on alone, it also turned on. Then adding object 1 didn't change it. So maybe each of those objects individually is a blicket. But then why was the machine off initially when object 1 was on it? That's confusing. Oh wait, the initial state had object 1 on the machine, and the light was off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. But when I added object 1 later with object 2, the light stayed on. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think step by step. When object 1 was alone on the machine (initial state), the light was off. So putting only object 1 on the machine doesn't activate it. But when I put object 0 on alone, it activated. Then object 2 alone activated. Then adding object 1 to the machine (which already had 2) kept it on. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But then if object 1 isn't a blicket, because when it was alone it didn't work, but objects 0 and 2 are blickets. But when I added object 1 to the machine with 2, the light stayed on because 2 was already a blicket. So the machine's rule is that it turns on when any blicket is present. So objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and 1 is not. But let's confirm. Let me test putting object 1 alone again. Let me take off objects 1 and 2, then put 1 on again. If the machine doesn't turn on, then 1 isn't a blicket. But right now, both 1 and 2 are on the machine. If I take 2 off, leaving 1, does the light stay on? Wait, currently, the machine is on with 1 and 2. If I take 2 off, then only 1 is left. If the light turns off, that confirms that 2 is a blicket and 1 isn't. So maybe the next step is to try that. Let me do that. So the command would be 'take object 2 off the machine' to see if the light stays on. Alternatively, maybe I can try putting each object one by one again to confirm. But since steps are limited, maybe efficient testing is better. Let me try removing object 2 now to check."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Let's recap the steps I've taken so far and the results.\n\nInitially, object 1 was on the machine, but the light was off. When I took it off, the light stayed off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, and the light turned on. Taking it off turned the light off again. Then object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light came on. Adding object 1 to the machine (with 2 already there) kept the light on. But when I removed object 2, leaving only object 1 on the machine, the light turned off. \n\nSo, from these observations:\n\n- Object 0 alone activates the machine.\n- Object 2 alone activates the machine.\n- Object 1 alone does not activate the machine (since initially it was on the machine and the light was off).\n- When both objects 1 and 2 were on the machine, the light stayed on. But since object 2 alone activates it, maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Wait, but when I added object 1 to the machine that already had object 2, the light remained on. But when only object 1 was on the machine (initially), the light was off. So object 1 might not be a blicket. \n\nWait, but when I put object 1 on the machine after object 2, the light stayed on. So maybe the machine requires at least one blicket. But that's possible if object 1 isn't a blicket, but 0 and 2 are. Because putting 0 alone works, 2 alone works. Then adding 1 to 2 doesn't change it. But when 1 is alone, it doesn't. So perhaps the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. Therefore, blickets are 0 and 2. \n\nBut wait, when I put object 1 on the machine after 2, the light stayed on. So even if 1 isn't a blicket, having 2 (a blicket) plus 1 (non-blicket) still activates the machine. That would fit with the rule being the presence of any blicket. So the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is on it. Therefore, objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and 1 is not. \n\nBut I should test another scenario. For example, if I put both 0 and 1 on the machine. Let's see: if 0 is a blicket and 1 is not, then putting 0 and 1 together should keep the light on. Let me try that. Currently, object 2 is off the machine, and object 1 is on the floor. So I can take object 1 off (but it's already off), so maybe put 0 and 1 on the machine. \n\nWait, right now, after the last command, the machine has object 1 on it (since after putting 1 on, then taking 2 off, the machine only has 1, which turned the light off). Wait, no. Let me check the latest state. After the last 'take object 2 off the machine', the objects are: 0 on floor, 1 on machine, 2 on floor. Wait no: the last look command showed after putting 1 and 2 on the machine, then taking 2 off. So the machine has object 1 on it. And the light is off. So putting object 1 alone doesn't activate it. So 1 is not a blicket. \n\nSo to confirm, let's try putting 0 and 1 together. First, take object 1 off (since it's on the machine now). Then put 0 on, then put 1 on. If the light stays on, that supports that 0 is a blicket. \n\nBut maybe I can test that. Let's proceed step by step. \n\nCurrent state after last step: object 1 is on the machine, object 2 is on the floor. The light is off. \n\nSo first, take object 1 off the machine. Then, put object 0 on the machine. The light should turn on. Then put object 1 on the machine. The light should remain on. Then take object 0 off, leaving object 1 on. The light should turn off. That would confirm that 0 is a blicket and 1 is not. \n\nSo the next commands would be:\n\ntake object 1 off the machine \u2192 light remains off (since 0 is on the floor). Then put 0 on \u2192 light on. Then put 1 on \u2192 light stays on. Then take 0 off \u2192 light turns off. That would confirm 0 is a blicket. \n\nBut since I have limited steps, maybe I can check if putting 0 and 1 together works. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can also check if putting all three objects on the machine would keep the light on. Since 0 and 2 are blickets, even if 1 is not, the machine should stay on. But perhaps that's redundant. \n\nAt this point, the evidence so far suggests that objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is on it. Because:\n\n- 0 alone \u2192 on\n- 2 alone \u2192 on\n- 1 alone \u2192 off\n- 0 + 1 \u2192 on (assuming, but need to test)\n- 2 + 1 \u2192 on (as seen when 2 was on, adding 1 kept it on)\n- 0 + 2 \u2192 on (haven't tested, but if both are blickets, machine should stay on)\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe check a combination. Let's see, currently, after the last step, the machine has object 1 on it, light off. \n\nSo take object 1 off \u2192 machine empty. Then put object 0 and 2 on. The light should be on. Then take one of them off. If taking one off leaves the other, the light should stay on. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But that seems less likely because putting 0 or 2 alone worked. So the rule is likely OR: at least one blicket must be present. \n\nSo the conclusion is that blickets are 0 and 2, rule is machine activates if at least one blicket is on it. \n\nBut to make sure, let's check one more case. What if I put objects 0 and 2 on the machine, then take one off. For example, put 0 and 2 on, then take 0 off. The light should stay on because 2 is still there. \n\nBut given step constraints, maybe I can end here. But perhaps there's a step left to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the number of blickets is even, but that doesn't fit the previous results (0 alone is odd count, but worked). \n\nAnother possible rule is that the machine activates if exactly one blicket is on. But when both 0 and 2 are on, that would be two, but the machine was on when both 1 and 2 were on (but 1 isn't a blicket, so 2 would be the only one). Wait, when I put 2 on, then added 1, the machine stayed on. So that would be 2 (blicket) alone, then adding 1 (non) still on. So the rule is OR. \n\nSo I think I have enough info. The blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it."}
