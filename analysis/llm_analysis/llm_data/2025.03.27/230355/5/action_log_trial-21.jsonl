I just started this game where I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. All are on the floor initially. The machine's light is off.\n\nFirst, I tried putting object 0 on the machine, and the light turned on. That's interesting. So, maybe object 0 is a blicket. But wait, the rule might not be as simple as just having any one blicket on the machine. It could require a specific number, like at least one, or maybe all blickets need to be on. Or perhaps a combination.\n\nI should test other objects to see their effects. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine next. If the light stays on, maybe the rule is that having any blicket on the machine activates it. But if the light goes off, maybe there's a different rule. Wait, no, when I added object 0, the light turned on. Let's see what happens when I add object 1.\n\nWait, but the machine's current state is on. So adding another object might not change it if the rule is \"at least one blicket\". Or maybe if the rule is \"exactly one\", adding another could turn it off. Hmm, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state depends on the combination of objects. Let's proceed step by step. After putting object 0 on, the light is on. Now, I can try adding object 1. If the light stays on, that could mean that either both 0 and 1 are blickets (and the rule is any blicket), or maybe the rule is additive. If the light goes off, that would be confusing. Or maybe the machine's state only changes when you modify the objects, so adding another might not affect it if the rule is already satisfied.\n\nWait, but the response when I put object 0 on was that the light turned on. Now, if I add object 1, maybe the light remains on. Let's try that. So next step: put object 1 on the machine. Then check the light's status. If it's still on, perhaps both 0 and 1 are blickets. If not, maybe only 0 is. Alternatively, the rule might require a certain number, like exactly one, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that all blickets must be on the machine. So if there are multiple blickets, they all need to be on. But since initially, putting 0 on turned it on, maybe 0 is the only blicket. But I need to test others.\n\nWait, but maybe the machine's state is determined by some logical combination. For example, if any blicket is on the machine, it turns on. Or if all blickets are on. So, to determine this, I need to test different combinations.\n\nLet's outline possible steps:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light on. So 0 might be a blicket. Rule could be at least one blicket.\n\n2. Then put object 1 on machine. If light remains on, maybe 1 is also a blicket, and the rule is any. If light turns off, that would be confusing. Wait, but if the rule is that all blickets must be on, then adding another blicket (1) would require also having others. But since we don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state is updated whenever you add or remove. So putting 0 on made it on. Adding 1 (if it's a blicket) would keep it on. If 1 is not a blicket, adding it wouldn't affect the state.\n\nWait, but how does the machine's rule work? The blicketness is such that the object's state (on or off machine) and machine's state have mutual information. So a blicket's presence affects the machine's state.\n\nSo, if the machine is on when 0 is on, then 0 is a blicket. Then, adding 1 and checking if the machine stays on. If adding 1 (non-blicket) doesn't affect it, then the machine remains on. If adding 1 (which is a blicket) doesn't change the state, but the rule is any, then the light remains on. So that might not help. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if exactly one blicket is on. Then adding another would turn it off. But that's a possible rule.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine is on if an even number of blickets are on. But that's more complex. Let's try to test step by step.\n\nSo current state: 0 is on the machine, light is on. Let's add 1. If light stays on, then either 1 is not a blicket (so machine stays on because 0 is still on), or 1 is a blicket and the rule is any number of blickets. If the light goes off, maybe the rule requires exactly one blicket, and adding another (if it's a blicket) would turn it off.\n\nBut to check, let's proceed. Next command: put object 1 on machine. Then check the light. Then maybe take one off to see.\n\nWait, but the user can only output one command at a time. So after putting object 0 on, the next step is to put object 1 on. Let's do that."}

Then adding object 1 kept it on. Hmm.\n\nSo, maybe the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. If object 0 is a blicket, then putting it on turns the machine on. Adding another object (object 1) which might not be a blicket doesn't change the state. But maybe object 1 is also a blicket. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine is on if any number of blickets are on it, or maybe it's a specific combination.\n\nWait, after putting object 0 on, the machine turns on. Then adding object 1 keeps it on. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets, but the machine just stays on as long as at least one is on. Or maybe the rule is that the machine is on when exactly one blicket is on. But in that case, adding a second would turn it off, which didn't happen here. So probably, the machine is on if there's at least one blicket on it. So putting 0 on turns it on, adding 1 (if it's a blicket) keeps it on. But how do I know if 1 is a blicket or not?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on. Let's think. If 0 is a blicket and 1 is not, then putting 0 on would turn it on. Adding 1 (a non-blicket) wouldn't affect it. But then if the rule is that all blickets must be on, then the machine would only turn on when all are on. But since there are three objects, maybe not. Wait, but in this case, after putting 0 on, the machine turns on. If the rule is \"at least one\", then 0 is a blicket. Then putting 1 on, if 1 is a blicket, machine stays on. If 1 is not, machine remains on because 0 is still there. So in either case, machine stays on. So adding 1 doesn't give new information.\n\nSo maybe I need to test removing objects. For example, after putting 0 and 1 on, if I take 0 off, does the machine stay on? If it stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 0 was the only blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on when an odd number of blickets are on it. But that's more complicated. Let's start with simpler hypotheses.\n\nSo next steps: take object 0 off the machine and see if the machine stays on. If it does, then object 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then only object 0 is a blicket.\n\nBut in the current state, both 0 and 1 are on the machine, and the machine is on. Let's try taking 0 off.\n\nSo the next command would be \"take object 0 off machine\". Then see if the light stays on. If it does, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then only 0 is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state depends on the combination of objects. Like a logical AND: all blickets must be on. But since there are three objects, maybe only some are blickets. For example, if the rule is that the machine turns on when both 0 and 1 are on, then adding 0 turns it on (if the rule is just 0), but that's conflicting. Hmm. Need more data.\n\nWait, after putting 0 on, the machine turned on. Then putting 1 on, it stayed on. So if the rule is that at least one blicket is on, then both 0 and 1 could be blickets, or only 0. To test, take 0 off. If machine stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then only 0 is. Then proceed to test others.\n\nSo the next step should be to take object 0 off the machine."}

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine's light turns on or off depending on which objects are placed on it. The goal is to determine which are blickets and the rule for the machine.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then, adding object 1 kept it on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving only object 1, the light turned off. Wait, that's interesting. So with object 0 alone, the machine is on. With object 1 added, still on. But removing 0 (leaving 1) made it turn off. Hmm, maybe object 0 is a blicket, and object 1 isn't. But wait, when I put 1 on the machine after 0, the light stayed on. Maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. Or maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets but the rule is that all blickets need to be on the machine? No, because when both were on and I took 0 off, leaving 1, the light turned off. So if 1 were a blicket, the machine should stay on. But it turned off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Wait, but when I put 1 on the machine after 0, the light stayed on. So maybe the presence of 0 is sufficient, and adding 1 doesn't affect it. Then when 0 is removed, even if 1 is there, the light goes off. So that suggests that object 0 is a blicket, and 1 is not. Let me test this again. Let me check if object 1 alone can turn the machine on. If I put object 1 on the machine by itself, does the light turn on? Wait, in the previous steps, when I put 0 on, it turned on. Then added 1, stayed on. Then took 0 off, leaving 1, and the light went off. So that suggests that 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. So maybe 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine is on if at least one blicket is on it. But then what about object 2? I haven't tested it yet. Let me try putting object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe only 0 is. Wait, but when I first put 0 on, the light turned on, then adding 1 kept it on. But perhaps the machine's rule is that it's on when any blicket is present, regardless of others. So if 0 is a blicket, then putting 0 on the machine activates it. Adding non-blickets (like 1) doesn't change that. But taking 0 off deactivates it. So 0 is a blicket, 1 and 2 are not. But what about object 2? Let's test putting 2 on the machine alone. If the light comes on, then 2 is a blicket. Otherwise, not. Also, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But there are three objects. If only 0 is a blicket, then the machine would turn on when 0 is on, regardless of others. Let's test. Next step: put object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe only 0 is. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if exactly one blicket is on it. Or another rule. Let's try. So right now, object 1 is on the machine (from previous steps). The light is off. Let me take object 1 off. Then put object 2 on. Then see if the light turns on. Wait, but how to do that. Let me think. Current state: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the machine, object 2 is on the floor. The light is off. So first, take object 1 off the machine. Then put object 2 on. Let me try that. So first, take object 1 off. Then the machine is empty. Then put object 2 on. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then not. That would help. But I need to do that step by step. So the next command should be taking object 1 off the machine. Then, put object 2 on. Let's see."}

When I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then I added object 1, and it stayed on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving object 1 on, the light turned off. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, and the machine requires it to be present. But wait, when I first put object 0 on alone, the machine turned on. Then adding object 1 didn't change it. But removing object 0 turned it off even though object 1 was still there. Hmm. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the machine only activates when at least one blicket is present. Or perhaps it's a different rule, like the machine requires all blickets to be on it.\n\nWait, let's recount the steps:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light on.\n2. Put object 1 on machine \u2192 light stays on.\n3. Take object 0 off \u2192 light off, even though object 1 is still on.\n\nSo that implies that object 0 is a blicket, and object 1 might not be. Because when object 0 was removed, the machine turned off even with object 1 present. So maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be on it. But then, when object 1 was added, the light stayed on. So if object 1 were a non-blicket, adding it wouldn't affect the state. Wait, but when I first put object 0 on, the light came on. Then adding object 1 didn't change it. Then removing object 0 caused the light to turn off. So perhaps object 0 is the only blicket so far. But I need to test more combinations.\n\nWhat about object 2? I haven't tried that yet. Let's test putting object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, maybe object 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe not. Also, need to check if combinations matter. For example, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is present, or if all blickets are present, etc.\n\nAnother test: what if I put object 1 on the machine alone. Let me see. When I first put object 0 on, the light turned on. Then added object 1, light stayed on. Then took 0 off, light turned off. So when only object 1 is on the machine, the light is off. So object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. That suggests object 1 is not a blicket. Then when object 0 is on, even with object 1, the machine is on. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket. Then, what about object 2?\n\nSo next step: put object 2 on the machine alone.

So far, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then I added object 1, and it stayed on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving only object 1, the light turned off. Hmm, so maybe object 0 is a blicket because its presence affects the machine. Then when I tried object 2 alone, the light turned on. Wait, that's different. Let me recap:\n\n- Object 0 alone: machine on.\n- Object 0 and 1 together: machine stays on.\n- Remove object 0 (only 1 left): machine off.\n- Object 2 alone: machine on.\n\nSo object 0 and 2 each can activate the machine by themselves. But object 1 didn't keep the machine on when alone. So maybe objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But let's test more. What if I put object 1 and 0 together? Wait, when I had both 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. So object 1 alone doesn't work. So 1 isn't a blicket. Then 2 alone works. So maybe 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is any blicket present activates the machine. Let me check if combining them has any effect. For example, if 0 is on, adding 2 doesn't change anything. But maybe the rule is more complex. Wait, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket? But when I put 0 and 1 on, machine stayed on, but 1 isn't a blicket. So that's not the case. So the rule is the machine activates if at least one blicket is on it. Therefore, objects 0 and 2 are blickets. Need to confirm by testing object 1 with another. Let's try putting 1 and 2 on the machine. If the machine stays on, then 2 is a blicket. Then remove 2 and see if 1 alone turns it off. But maybe I should test object 1 alone again. Wait, when I put object 1 on the machine after 0 was already there, the light stayed on. But when 0 was removed, the light went off. So 1 alone doesn't activate it. So 1 is not a blicket. Object 2 alone activates. So 2 is a blicket. So the blickets are 0 and 2. The rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is on it. Let me confirm by adding object 1 to 2. If I put 1 and 2 on, machine should stay on. Then take off 2, leaving 1. Machine should turn off. Let me try that. But first, I need to execute the next command. The last action was putting object 2 on the machine, which turned it on. Now, maybe take object 2 off to see if the light goes off. But maybe I should check combinations. Let's proceed step by step."}

The goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. \n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then I added object 1, and the light stayed on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving object 1 on the machine, the light turned off. That suggests that object 0 is a blicket because removing it caused the machine to turn off even though object 1 was still there. But wait, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. Let me think.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then putting object 1 on kept it on. Then removing 0 turned it off, even though 1 was still there. That implies that object 0 is necessary for the machine to stay on. So maybe the rule is that the machine is on if at least one blicket is on it. But when 0 was removed, even with 1 still on, the light went off. That would mean that 0 is a blicket and 1 isn't. But then why did adding 1 not affect the state? Because the machine was already on when 0 was on. Hmm.\n\nWait, when I put 0 on, machine on. Then adding 1 (which might not be a blicket) didn't change it. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) turned it off. So the machine only stays on if a blicket is present. Since 1 alone didn't keep it on, 1 isn't a blicket. Then 0 is a blicket. \n\nThen I tried object 2: putting it on turned the machine on. Taking it off turned it off. So 2 might also be a blicket. Wait, but when 0 was on, adding 1 didn't change it. Then removing 0 turned it off. So 0 is a blicket. But when I put 2 on, the machine turned on, which would suggest 2 is a blicket. So maybe both 0 and 2 are blickets. But then what's the rule? If the machine requires at least one blicket, then putting either 0 or 2 would activate it. But when I put 1 on, after 0 was on, the machine stayed on. But when I took 0 off, leaving 1, it turned off. So 1 isn't a blicket. \n\nWait, but when I put 1 on the machine after 0, the light stayed on. That's expected because 0 was already making it on. Then removing 0 (a blicket) leaves only 1 (non-blicket), so the machine turns off. \n\nSo possible rule: The machine turns on if there is at least one blicket on it. So the blickets are 0 and 2, because putting either of them on alone activates the machine. Object 1 doesn't activate it when alone. But wait, I haven't tested putting 1 on the machine alone yet. Let me check the previous steps. \n\nLooking back: After putting 0 on, machine on. Then put 1 on, machine stayed on. Then took 0 off, machine off. Then took 1 off. Then put 2 on, machine on. Then took 2 off, machine off. \n\nSo the key tests are: when 0 is on alone, machine on. When 1 is on alone, machine off (but I didn't test that yet). Wait, no. The user tried putting object 1 on after 0 was already on. But when the user took 0 off, leaving 1, the machine turned off. That implies that 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. So 1 is not a blicket. \n\nBut when the user put object 2 on alone, machine turned on. Then taking it off turned it off. So 2 is a blicket. So 0 and 2 are blickets, and 1 is not. The rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is on it. So the blickets are 0 and 2. \n\nBut wait, is there a possibility of a more complex rule, like requiring all blickets to be on? Let me see. If the rule was that all blickets must be on, then putting 0 on alone would not activate the machine unless 2 is also on. But when 0 was put on alone, machine turned on. So that's not the case. So the rule is that at least one blicket is on. \n\nTherefore, the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is placed on it. But I should test if 1 alone does anything. Wait, the user hasn't tried putting object 1 on the machine alone yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user put 0 on, then 1, but when 0 was removed, machine turned off. Then they took 1 off, then put 2 on. So they never tested putting 1 alone. \n\nSo the user needs to test putting 1 on alone. Let's see. Currently, all objects are on the floor. The next command should be putting object 1 on the machine to see if the light turns on. If it doesn't, that confirms 1 is not a blicket. If it does, then 1 is a blicket. \n\nBut according to the previous steps, when the user put object 1 on the machine while 0 was already there, the light stayed on, but that's because 0 was a blicket. Then when they removed 0, leaving 1, the light turned off. So that suggests that 1 alone isn't a blicket. But to confirm, they should test putting 1 alone. \n\nSo next step: put object 1 on machine. If light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then not. Since the user hasn't done that yet, they should. \n\nBut the user's previous steps didn't include that. So in the current state, after taking 2 off, all objects are on the floor. The user should now try putting 1 on the machine alone. Let's see what the next command would be. \n\nIn the last step, the user took object 2 off, so now all objects are on the floor. The light is off. The next command should be 'put object 1 on machine' to test if it activates. If the light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then not. \n\nBut the user hasn't done that yet. So the current state is all objects on floor, machine off. The next logical step is to test 1 alone. So the command would be 'put object 1 on machine'. \n\nAfter that, if the machine stays off, then 1 is not a blicket, confirming that. Then the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that any blicket on the machine turns it on. \n\nAlternatively, if putting 1 on activates it, then 1 is a blicket. But based on previous steps, when 1 was left on the machine with 0 removed, the light turned off, which suggests that 1 alone doesn't activate it. So likely, putting 1 on alone would not activate it. \n\nTherefore, after this test, the user can confirm the blickets and the rule. \n\nBut given the step limit, the user might want to confirm this. \n\nSo the next command should be 'put object 1 on machine' to test."}

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule makes the machine turn on. So far, I've tried putting objects on the machine and observed the results.\n\nWhen I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then I added object 1, and the light stayed on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving only object 1, the light turned off. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, and maybe object 1 isn't. But wait, when I put object 1 alone on the machine again later, the light didn't turn on. So object 1 alone doesn't activate it. Then I tried object 2: putting it on the machine made the light turn on, and removing it turned the light off. So object 2 also seems to activate the machine when placed alone.\n\nBut there's a conflict here. Earlier, when both objects 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on. But when only object 1 was there, it was off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But objects 0 and 2 each activate it alone. Then what about when I put object 1 on the machine alone again, the light stayed off. So object 1 is not a blicket. But when I added object 1 after object 0, the light stayed on. Wait, but that's expected if the machine is already on. Maybe the machine's state depends on the presence of any blicket. So perhaps objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and object 1 isn't.\n\nWait, but when I put object 1 on the machine alone, the light didn't turn on. So object 1 isn't a blicket. Then, when I put object 0 and 1 together, the machine was on because of object 0. Then when I removed 0, leaving 1, it turned off. That makes sense. Then object 2 also works alone, so it's a blicket. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it. So blickets are objects that, when placed on the machine, cause it to activate. But why did putting object 1 on after 0 not change the state? Because the machine was already on. So the rule could be that the machine is on if at least one blicket is present. Therefore, objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and 1 is not. But I should test combinations to confirm.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 on, light on. Then added 1, light stayed on. Then took 0 off, light off. So with 0 alone, on. With 0 and 1, on. With 1 alone, off. So 0 is a blicket. Then object 2 alone works. So 2 is a blicket. But what if I put both 0 and 2 on the machine? Let's test that. Maybe the machine stays on as long as at least one blicket is present. But I need to check if the machine's behavior changes when multiple blickets are added. Also, maybe the rule is more complex, like an OR gate: any blicket present turns it on.\n\nWait, the user instruction says that a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So mutual information implies that the presence of the object affects the machine's state. So if putting the object on the machine changes the probability of the machine being on, then it's a blicket. \n\nSo let's recap:\n\n- Object 0: when placed alone, machine turns on. Removing it turns off. So mutual information is high. Therefore, blicket.\n\n- Object 1: placing it alone doesn't turn on the machine. So mutual information is low. Not a blicket.\n\n- Object 2: placing alone turns on, removing turns off. So mutual info high. Blicket.\n\nBut wait, when I put object 1 on the machine after object 0, the machine remained on. Then removing object 0 (leaving 1) turned it off. So the presence of 1 didn't affect it. So object 1 isn't a blicket. \n\nTherefore, the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. So to confirm, I should test putting 0 and 2 together. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent state: all objects are on the floor. Let me put object 0 on machine. Light turns on. Then put object 2 on machine. Light should stay on. Then take object 0 off. If the light stays on, since 2 is still there. Let me try that.\n\nBut I need to proceed step by step. So next steps: put 0 on machine (light on), then put 2 on machine (light remains on), then take 0 off. If light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. Then take 2 off, light off. That would confirm.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is different, like the machine requires exactly one blicket, but that's unlikely given previous results.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when I put object 0 on, light on. Then added object 1, light stayed on. Then took 0 off, light off. That suggests that 0 is a blicket and 1 is not. Then putting 2 on alone works. So 2 is a blicket. \n\nBut maybe there's a different rule. For example, the machine turns on if an even number of blickets are present. But in that case, putting two blickets would turn it off. But when I put 0 and 1 (assuming 1 is not a blicket), the machine stayed on, which would be expected if 0 is a blicket. But 1 isn't, so number of blickets is 1 (odd), but the machine is on. So that rule wouldn't fit. So the simplest rule is OR: any blicket present.\n\nBut I need to test combinations. Let's try adding object 0 and 2 together. Since both are blickets, the machine should stay on when either is present.\n\nBut in the current state, all objects are on the floor. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, put object 0 on the machine: light on. Then put object 2 on the machine: light remains on. Then take object 0 off: light should stay on because 2 is still there. Then take 2 off: light off. That would confirm that each is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket must be present. But in that case, putting both 0 and 2 would turn it off. But when I put 0 and 1 (assuming 1 is not a blicket), the machine stayed on, which would be correct (0 is a blicket). But that doesn't test the two-blicket scenario. So I need to check that.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, when I put object 0 on, machine on. Then put object 1 on, machine remains on. Then removing 0 turns it off. So 1 isn't a blicket. So the presence of non-blickets doesn't affect the machine. So if I put 0 and 2 on the machine, the machine should stay on. Then removing one would leave the other, keeping it on.\n\nBut I need to perform these steps to confirm. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent step: the last action was putting object 1 on the machine, and the light stayed off. So object 1 is on the machine. Let's take it off first.\n\nBut according to the history:\n\nLast command was 'put object 1 on machine', and the light turned off. Wait, no, in the previous steps, after taking object 2 off, the machine was off. Then the user put object 1 on the machine, and the light stayed off. So object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. So that's confirmed. Now, the current state is object 1 is on the machine, and the light is off. So perhaps the next step is to take object 1 off and try combining 0 and 2.\n\nBut according to the interaction history, the last action was:\n\n> put object 1 on machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nSo now, object 1 is on the machine, and the light is off. So the machine is off with object 1 on it. So the next step is to take object 1 off, then put objects 0 and 2 on the machine.\n\nSo, next command: take object 1 off the machine. Then put 0 and 2 on.\n\nBut since the user has to input one command at a time.\n\nSo first, take object 1 off.\n\nThen put 0 on machine.\n\nThen put 2 on machine.\n\nThen take 0 off and see if the machine remains on.\n\nBut since I have limited steps, I need to plan efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, since I already have some evidence that 0 and 2 activate the machine when alone, maybe the rule is that either of them is present. So the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. Object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should test combinations. For example, if both 0 and 2 are on the machine, does the machine stay on? And when removing one, does it stay on because the other is present.\n\nBut given the step limit, perhaps it's better to conclude now.\n\nWait, but let's see. Let's try putting 0 and 2 on the machine. If the machine is on, then taking off one would leave the other, so the machine stays on. That would confirm the OR rule.\n\nSo, current state: object 1 is on the machine, light is off. So first, take object 1 off.\n\nThen put 0 on machine (light on). Then put 2 on machine (light on). Then take 0 off (light stays on because 2 is there). Then take 2 off (light off). That would confirm.\n\nBut each of these steps uses a command. Let's see how many steps I have left.\n\nThe user's previous steps:\n\n1. look\n2. put 0 on machine (error)\n3. put object 0 on machine (step 1)\n4. put object 1 on machine (step 2)\n5. take object 0 off (step 3)\n6. look (step4)\n7. take object 1 off (step5)\n8. look (step6)\n9. look (step7)\n10. put object 2 on machine (step8)\n11. take object 2 off (step9)\n12. put object 1 on machine (step10)\nTotal steps used: 12. Remaining steps: 20. So plenty left.\n\nBut in the current state after step12: object1 is on machine, light off. So I need to take object1 off, then proceed.\n\nSo next command:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 2 off machine\n\nEach of these steps. But since I need to output one command at a time.\n\nSo the next command after the user's last action (put object1 on machine, light off) is to take object1 off.\n\nBut the user's last action was:\n\n> put object 1 on machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nSo current state: objects on machine: 1. Light off. Objects on floor: 0, 2.\n\nSo next command:\n\ntake object 1 off machine\n\nThen, put object0 on machine (light on), then put object2 on machine (light remains on), then take object0 off (light remains on because 2 is there), then take object2 off (light off).\n\nThis would confirm that both 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, if the machine turns off when both are on, that would suggest a different rule, but that's unlikely.\n\nBut given the previous steps where each alone activates, this is the expected behavior.\n\nSo, proceeding with this plan.\n\nBut let's see the exact steps.\n\nCurrent step: After step12, the user's command was 'put object 1 on machine', which resulted in the light being off. So the next command is to take object1 off.\n\nSo:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nThen, the machine has no objects, light off.\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 0 on machine (light on)\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 2 on machine (light stays on)\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 0 off machine (light stays on because object2 is present)\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 2 off machine (light off)\n\nEach of these steps.\n\nBut since the user has to input each command one at a time, let's proceed.\n\nBut perhaps after taking object1 off, and putting 0 and 2 on, we can confirm the rule.\n\nAlternatively, the user can exit early if confident.\n\nBut in the initial tests, objects 0 and 2 each activate the machine alone, and object1 does not. So the rule is likely that the machine activates if any blicket is present. Therefore, the blickets are 0 and 2.\n\nBut to be thorough, the combination of 0 and 2 should be tested. Let's do that.\n\nSo, after taking object1 off, the next command is:\n\nput object 0 on machine\n\nWhich would make the light turn on. Then, put object2 on machine. Light remains on. Then take 0 off. If light remains on, then 2 is a blicket. Then take 2 off, light turns off. This confirms both are blickets.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state after step12: object1 is on machine, light off.\n\nFirst, take object1 off:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nNow, all objects are on the floor. Light is off.\n\nNext, put object0 on machine:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nLight turns on.\n\nNext, put object2 on machine:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nLight stays on.\n\nNext, take object0 off:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nIf light stays on (because object2 is still there), then confirms that 2 is a blicket.\n\nThen take object2 off:\n\n> take object 2 off machine\n\nLight turns off.\n\nThis sequence would confirm both are blickets.\n\nBut given step limits, but since there are 32 steps, and we've used 12, there's plenty left.\n\nBut perhaps the user can conclude earlier. However, to ensure the rule is correct, testing the combination is important.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have already gathered enough info. But to be safe, proceed.\n\nSo, next command after the last step (put object1 on machine, light off) is to take object1 off.\n\nThus, the next command is:\n\n> take object 1 off machine"}

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. \n\nFrom previous interactions:\n\n- When I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then adding object 1 kept it on. But when I removed object 0, the light turned off even though object 1 was still there. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, and maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be on it. But when I took object 0 off, the light went off even with object 1. Then, when I put object 1 alone on the machine, the light stayed off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. \n\nThen, when I put object 2 on the machine alone, the light turned on. Then removing it turned the light off. So object 2 might also be a blicket. But then when I put object 1 on the machine again, the light didn't turn on. So object 1 isn't a blicket. \n\nWait, but the initial test with object 0 and 1: putting both on the machine kept the light on. But when only 1 was left, it turned off. So maybe the machine requires at least one blicket. But then when object 1 was put alone, the light stayed off. So perhaps objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and object 1 isn't. \n\nBut let's check if the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it. So if I put object 0 or 2 alone, the light should turn on. That seems to be the case. But when I put object 1 alone, it doesn't. So maybe objects 0 and 2 are blickets. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different. What if the machine requires all blickets to be on it? But that doesn't fit because when I had object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was on. If the rule required all blickets (say 0 and 2), then having only 0 on should not be sufficient. But in that case, putting 0 on made the light turn on. So that's conflicting. So the rule is more likely that at least one blicket is on the machine. \n\nSo the possible blickets are 0 and 2. But let's test further. Maybe try putting both 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, then that's consistent. But maybe the rule is that the number of blickets is even, or some other condition. \n\nWait, when I put object 0 on first, light on. Then add object 1, light remains on. Remove 0, light off. Then take off 1, light off. Then put object 2 on, light on. So 0 and 2 each alone activate the machine. Object 1 alone doesn't. So 0 and 2 are blickets. The rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. \n\nBut let me confirm by testing combinations. For example, if I put both 0 and 2 on the machine, does the light stay on? If yes, then the rule is \"any blicket\". If it turns off, maybe there's a different rule. Wait, when I added object 1 to 0, the light stayed on. But removing 0 turned it off. So the presence of a non-blicket doesn't affect it as long as a blicket is present. \n\nSo maybe the rule is that the machine is on if there's at least one blicket on it. So objects 0 and 2 are blickets, 1 is not. \n\nBut let's test putting both 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, that supports the rule. If it turns off, maybe there's a different rule. But since each alone works, combining them should keep it on. \n\nSo the next step could be to put 0 and 2 on the machine together. Let's see. But first, maybe check if adding a non-blicket to a blicket affects anything. For example, put 0 on (light on), then add 1 (light stays on). Then remove 0, light turns off. So non-blickets don't interfere, but the presence of at least one blicket is necessary. \n\nSo the rule seems to be: the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. Therefore, objects 0 and 2 are blickets. But to be thorough, maybe test putting 0 and 2 together. \n\nBut in the current state, all objects are on the floor. So I need to put 0 and 2 on the machine. Let's do that. \n\nCommand: put object 0 on machine. Then put object 2 on machine. If the light stays on, that confirms the rule. But since each individually turns it on, together they should as well. \n\nBut let's check. So the next command would be to put object 0 and 2 on the machine. Wait, the command is 'put object X on machine' one at a time. So first, put 0 on, light on. Then put 2 on, light should stay on. \n\nBut in the current state, the last action was taking object 1 off, so all are on the floor. So next step:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then that's expected. Then, adding object 2 on the machine would keep it on. \n\nBut maybe the user already did that, but according to the history, when object 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So adding 0 and 2 should keep it on. \n\nBut the user hasn't tried that combination yet. So testing that would help confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But that's unlikely because when you have two blickets on, the machine would still be on. \n\nSo the next step is to test putting 0 and 2 on the machine. Let's proceed."}

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
