Let me start by understanding the setup. There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2, all on the floor. The machine is off right now. \n\nFirst, I should probably try putting each object on the machine one by one to see if the machine activates. But wait, the rule might not be as simple as a single blicket activating the machine. Maybe it requires a combination? Hmm. But since I have limited steps, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me start by putting object 0 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it needs more than one. But let's test each individually first.\n\nSo, command: put 0 on machine. Then check the light. If it turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. Then repeat for 1 and 2. But maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So if putting one doesn't work, but putting two does, then both are blickets. Or maybe it's an OR condition where any blicket being on the machine activates it. \n\nAlternatively, the rule could be something like the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is on it, or if an even number of blickets are on. But without knowing, I need to test different combinations. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, put 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens. If the light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 0 isn't. Then take 0 off and try 1. Then 2. Then maybe combinations. \n\nWait, but each time I put an object on, I can check the machine's state. So let's try putting 0 on. If machine is on, then 0 is a blicket. Then take 0 off and try 1. But maybe multiple blickets are needed. For example, if the rule is \"at least one blicket must be on the machine,\" then putting any single blicket on would activate it. If the rule is \"all blickets must be on,\" then only when all are placed, it activates. \n\nSo possible rules: OR (any blicket present), AND (all blickets present), XOR (exactly one), etc. \n\nLet me start with individual tests. \n\nPut 0 on machine. Check machine state. Then put 1 on, check again. Then put 2 on. Wait, but if adding each one and checking after each step. For example, if after putting 0, machine is on. Then putting 1 on might keep it on or turn it off, depending on the rule. But maybe that's too many steps. Alternatively, test each alone. \n\nBut first, initial step: put 0 on machine. Let's see."}

So I'm trying to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule makes the machine turn on. The machine's light turned on when I put object 1 on it along with object 0. Wait, no, actually, when I first put object 0 on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. Hmm. So maybe object 1 is a blicket, but maybe it's a combination. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the first command was \"put 0 on machine\" but the system said 0 is not recognized. Then I corrected to \"put object 0 on machine\", and the light was still off. Then after putting object 1 on the machine, the light came on. So object 0 alone didn't activate it, but adding object 1 did. So maybe either object 1 is a blicket, or the combination of 0 and 1. But how to tell?\n\nWait, when I put object 0 on the machine first, light off. Then added object 1, light on. So the machine turned on when both 0 and 1 were on it. But maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is present. If 1 is a blicket, then putting it on alone should activate the machine. But in the current state, both 0 and 1 are on the machine and the light is on. Maybe I should test taking one off. For example, take object 1 off and see if the light stays on or turns off. If the light turns off, that suggests that object 1 was necessary. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the presence of any blicket activates the machine, regardless of others. But in that case, if object 1 is a blicket, putting it on alone should activate. Let me try that next. But first, maybe check what happens when I take object 1 off. Let's see.\n\nWait, right now, both 0 and 1 are on the machine. The light is on. If I take object 1 off, leaving only 0 on the machine, does the light stay on? If it turns off, then object 1 is a blicket. If it stays on, maybe object 0 is also a blicket, but that's unlikely because when I put 0 alone earlier, the light was off. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But in that case, if 1 is a blicket, putting it on alone should activate the machine. So next step: take object 1 off the machine and see if the light turns off. Then, put object 1 back alone and see if the light turns on. Also, test object 2. Let's plan the steps.\n\nFirst, take object 1 off. Then check the light. If it's off, then 1 is a blicket. Then put 1 back alone. If the light comes on, that confirms it. Then test object 2 by putting it on alone. If the light doesn't come on, then 2 isn't a blicket. Alternatively, if the machine requires all blickets to be on, but that seems less likely given the initial result. Let's proceed."}

Also, maybe test combinations. For example, if object 0 and 1 are on, does the light stay on? Wait, earlier when I added object 1 to object 0, the light turned on. But if object 0 isn't a blicket, then maybe the presence of a blicket (object 1) is sufficient. So, next step: test object 2. Let's put object 2 on the machine alone and see if the light comes on."}

Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. But when I took object 1 off, the light went off again. That suggests that object 1 might be a blicket. But wait, when I put object 2 on the machine alone, the light also turned on. So maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets. But what's the rule here?\n\nLet me recap the steps. Initially, all objects were on the floor. I put 0 on the machine, no light. Then added 1, light on. Then took 1 off, light off. Then put 2 on, light on. Now both 0 and 2 are on the machine, but when I put 2 alone, it worked. Wait, no. Wait, when I put object 2 on the machine, object 0 was already there. Wait, no. Wait, let me check the steps again:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine. Light off.\n2. Put object 1 on machine. Light turns on.\n3. Take object 1 off. Light off.\n4. Put object 2 on machine. Now, objects on machine are 0 and 2. Light turns on.\n\nSo when I added object 2 to the machine (which already had object 0), the light came on. Then when I looked, both 0 and 2 were on the machine, light on. Wait, but previously when object 0 was alone, light was off. Then adding 1 made it on. Taking 1 off left 0, light off. Then adding 2 to 0 made it on. So maybe the machine requires at least one blicket, but object 0 isn't a blicket. Because when 0 was alone, no light. Then when 1 or 2 is added, the light turns on. Wait, but when I put object 2 on the machine, maybe object 0 was still there. Wait, no, let me check the exact sequence again:\n\nAfter putting object 0 on machine, then object 1. Then took object 1 off. So after that, object 0 is still on the machine. Then putting object 2 on machine adds it to the existing 0. So the machine now has 0 and 2. Light is on. Then when I looked, both 0 and 2 are on the machine. So in that case, the presence of 0 and 2 together causes the light to be on. But if 0 alone doesn't, and 2 alone (if I take 0 off and put 2 on) would that work?\n\nWait, maybe I need to test whether object 2 alone causes the light to be on. Because in the current state, 0 and 2 are on the machine, and the light is on. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. If 1 and 2 are blickets, but 0 is not. Let's see:\n\n- Object 0 alone: off.\n- Object 1 alone: on. (Assuming that when I put 1 on machine, 0 was already there, but after taking 1 off, 0 remains. Wait, no: when I put object 1 on the machine after 0, the machine had both 0 and 1, and the light turned on. Then taking 1 off left 0, and the light went off. Then putting 2 on (so 0 and 2) turned it on again. So perhaps the presence of either 1 or 2 (but not 0) is sufficient. But in that case, when 0 and 2 are present, the machine is on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and 0 is not. But why does the machine turn on when 2 is added to 0? Because 2 is a blicket. So perhaps the rule is that if at least one blicket is on the machine, it turns on. So 1 and 2 are blickets, 0 is not. But how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. Wait, but when 1 and 2 are both on, maybe it's off. I need to test that. But I haven't tried putting both 1 and 2 on the machine yet. Let's think about what's needed next.\n\nCurrent state: objects 0 and 2 are on the machine, light is on. Let's try taking 0 off and see if the light stays on. If the light stays on with just 2, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the rule requires multiple blickets or something else.\n\nSo possible next steps: take object 0 off the machine. If the light stays on, then 2 alone is sufficient. If it turns off, then maybe both 0 and 2 are needed, but that would contradict previous steps where 0 alone didn't work. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine is on if any blicket is present. So 1 and 2 are blickets, 0 is not. Then, in the current state (0 and 2), since 2 is a blicket, the machine is on. If I remove 0, leaving 2, the machine should stay on. But if removing 2 and leaving 0, it should turn off. Let's test that.\n\nBut I have limited steps, so need to plan carefully.\n\nSo next command: take object 0 off the machine. Then see if the light stays on. If yes, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 2 isn't, but the combination of 0 and 2 is needed, which would be strange. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, but that seems less likely given previous steps.\n\nWait, when I put object 1 on the machine (with 0 already there), the light turned on. Then taking 1 off made it off again. So 1 is a blicket. Similarly, adding 2 (with 0) made it on. So if 2 is a blicket, then even with 0 (non-blicket) on, the machine is on. So the presence of any blicket activates the machine, regardless of other non-blickets.\n\nBut to confirm, need to see if 2 alone works. So take object 0 off, leaving 2. If light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the rule requires both 0 and 2, but that's unlikely because 0 alone didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two objects are on it, but that can't be because when 0 was alone, it was off. Then adding 1 (so two objects) turned it on. But then taking 1 off left 0, and it turned off. Then adding 2 (so two objects again) turned it on. But that would mean the rule is two or more objects. But that would make 0,1,2 all non-blickets, which contradicts the problem statement. Because the blickets are defined as objects whose presence affects the machine. So that can't be the case.\n\nSo more likely, 1 and 2 are blickets. So whenever at least one of them is on the machine, it turns on, regardless of 0. But 0 isn't a blicket. So the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket (1 or 2) is on it. Then, in the current state, 0 and 2 are on, so the machine is on because of 2. If I remove 0, leaving 2, the machine should stay on. Let's test that.\n\nSo next step: take object 0 off machine.\n\nBut the current commands are:\n\nAfter putting 2 on machine, the light is on. Now, looking shows objects 0 and 2 on machine. The light is on. So next step:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nIf the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe 0 and 2 together are needed. But that's unlikely. Let's see what happens."}

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets are objects that have a non-independent relationship with the machine's state, meaning their presence affects whether the machine is on.\n\nLet's recap the steps taken so far. Initially, all objects were on the floor. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light stayed off. Then object 1 was added, and the light turned on. When object 1 was removed, the light went off. Then object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on again. After that, object 0 was on the machine along with object 2, and the light stayed on. Then when object 0 was removed, the light remained on.\n\nWait, after putting object 0 on the machine alone didn't activate it. Then adding object 1 turned it on. Taking object 1 off turned it off. Then putting object 2 on turned it on again. Then with both 0 and 2 on the machine, the light was on. Removing 0 left 2 on the machine, and the light stayed on. So object 2 alone can activate the machine. Similarly, object 1 alone activates it. But object 0 alone doesn't. So maybe objects 1 and 2 are blickets. But what about when both 0 and 1 were on the machine? Wait, when object 0 was placed first, then adding 1 turned it on. But when 1 was taken off, it turned off. So object 1's presence caused the activation. Then object 2 alone activates. So maybe 1 and 2 are blickets. But what about combinations?\n\nWait, when object 0 and 2 were both on the machine, the light stayed on. But removing 0 didn't affect it. So object 2 alone is enough. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But how to confirm which are blickets.\n\nFrom the tests:\n\n- 0 alone: machine off. So 0 is not a blicket.\n- 1 alone: machine on. So 1 is a blicket.\n- 2 alone: machine on. So 2 is a blicket.\n- 0 and 2: machine on (since after removing 0, it's still on). So 2 is a blicket.\n\nSo the rule seems to be that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it. Since 1 and 2 activate it alone, they are blickets. Object 0 doesn't. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is the machine activates if at least one blicket is placed on it.\n\nBut wait, when both 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on. But when 1 was removed, it turned off. So that's consistent with 1 being a blicket. The previous step where 0 was on the machine alone didn't activate it, confirming 0 isn't a blicket.\n\nSo the conclusion is objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. Let me check if there's any other possible rule. For example, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket, but that doesn't fit because when both 1 and 2 are on, it would still work. Alternatively, maybe it's an OR condition. So yes, OR rule. So the answer is blickets 1 and 2, and the rule is the machine turns on when any blicket is placed on it."}

Put object 1 on machine. Light turns on. So with 0 and 1 on the machine, it's on.\n3. Take object 1 off. Light goes off. So now only 0 is on, light is off.\n4. Put object 2 on machine. Now 0 and 2 are on. Light turns on.\n5. Take object 0 off. Now only object 2 is on. Light stays on.\n\nSo, from this, when object 2 is on the machine alone, the light is on.

Or perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when object 2 is on alone, the light is on, so object 2 is a blicket. When object 1 and 0 are on, the light is on. But object 0 alone doesn't activate it. So maybe object 1 is a blicket. Because adding it to 0 (non-blicket) made the machine turn on.

Then when 2 was added with 0, it turned on, but when 0 was removed, 2 alone kept it on. So 2 is definitely a blicket. \n\nBut wait, when object 1 was put on the machine with object 0, the machine turned on. If object 0 isn't a blicket (since alone it didn't do anything), then object 1 must be a blicket. Because adding it caused the machine to activate. Then, when object 1 was removed, the machine turned off. So the presence of object 1 was necessary. So object 1 is a blicket. Similarly, object 2 alone activates the machine, so it's a blicket. Object 0 isn't because when it was alone, nothing happened. \n\nSo the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Therefore, objects 1 and 2 are blickets.
