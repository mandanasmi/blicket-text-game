There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. All are on the floor initially, and the machine is off.\n\nFirst, I need to test each object one by one to see if placing them on the machine activates it. So the first step is to put object 0 on the machine. After doing that, the machine is still off. Hmm, maybe object 0 alone isn't a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one object. But maybe object 0 is a blicket but the machine requires a specific combination. Let me check the next step.\n\nSince putting object 0 didn't work, I should try another object. Next, put object 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then maybe object 1 is a blicket. If not, maybe both 0 and 1 together are needed. Wait, but in the first step, after putting object 0, the machine stayed off. Let's try adding object 1 next. So maybe combining objects? Let's try that.\n\nWait, but maybe each object has a different effect. Maybe the machine turns on if any blicket is present, or only if all blickets are present. Let's test individual objects first. After object 0 didn't work, let's take it off and try object 1 alone. Then object 2 alone. If none of them individually activate the machine, then the rule might require a combination. For example, maybe the machine turns on when at least two blickets are placed, or a specific set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires a certain number of blickets. Let's proceed step by step. After putting object 0 on and it's still off, perhaps object 0 isn't a blicket. Then try putting object 1 on next. If the machine turns on, then maybe either 1 is a blicket. If not, maybe both 0 and 1 together. Wait, but when I put 0 on, nothing happened. Then adding 1 might change it. Let's try that.\n\nWait, but the user just put object 0 on the machine, and the light is still off. So the next command could be to put object 1 on the machine as well. Let's see if combining them activates the machine. If so, then maybe both are blickets and the rule is that all blickets need to be on the machine. Or maybe any blicket being present activates it, but perhaps the machine only turns on when at least one is present, but maybe some objects are not blickets. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets, or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is more complex, like requiring exactly two blickets. So after putting 0 and 1, if the machine turns on, then maybe those two are blickets. If not, maybe try adding 2. Or perhaps removing one and testing others.\n\nSo the next logical step is to place another object on the machine and see the effect. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine next. If the machine turns on, then perhaps either 0 or 1 is a blicket. But since putting 0 alone didn't work, maybe 1 is the blicket. Wait, but if putting 1 alone works, then why didn't it activate when placed with 0? Wait, maybe the machine only activates when certain objects are present. Let's see.\n\nWait, in the initial state, all objects are on the floor. After putting 0 on the machine, it's still off. Then if I put 1 on the machine, the machine's state may change.

The goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. So far, I put object 0 on the machine, and the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. Hmm.\n\nSo initially, both objects 0 and 1 were on the floor. When I placed object 0 alone, nothing happened. But adding object 1 made the machine activate. That suggests that either object 1 is a blicket, or maybe both 0 and 1 together are needed. Wait, but when I placed 0 first, the machine stayed off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. If that's the case, then either 1 is a blicket, or both 0 and 1 are blickets but the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Wait, but adding 0 alone didn't work. So maybe 1 is a blicket, and 0 isn't. But let's test further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are placed. But with only two objects on the machine (0 and 1), that would mean both are blickets. But then, if I remove one, does the machine turn off? Let me check. If I take object 1 off now, the machine should turn off if it's a blicket. Let's try that. But wait, I have a limited number of steps, so maybe I should first test other combinations.\n\nWait, right now, objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, and the light is on. What if I take object 0 off? If the light stays on, that would mean object 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 0 and 1 are required. Let's try that next. But maybe I should first check what happens when I put object 2 on the machine. Let's see: current state is 0 and 1 on machine. If I add 2, does the light stay on? Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present. But in that case, putting 1 alone should turn it on. Let me try that. So first, I should take all objects off and test each individually.\n\nWait, but each step counts. Let's think strategically. Since putting 0 and 1 together turned it on, but 0 alone didn't. So maybe 1 is a blicket. Let's test putting 1 alone on the machine. To do that, I need to take off object 0. So:\n\nTake object 0 off the machine. Then check if the light stays on. If it does, then object 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets and the rule is that all blickets must be on. But how many blickets are there? There are three objects. Let's see.\n\nBut let's go step by step. Currently, objects 0 and 1 are on the machine. Light is on. Let's take object 0 off. So command: take object 0 off the machine. Then check the light. If it stays on, then object 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then both 0 and 1 are needed. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that any one blicket is sufficient. So if 1 is a blicket, then putting just 1 on should turn it on. Let's test that.\n\nSo next step: take object 0 off. Then see if the light remains on. Then take 1 off and try putting 1 back alone."}

Let me start by recalling what happened so far. \n\nInitially, all objects were on the floor, and the machine was off. Then I put object 0 on the machine, and the machine stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the machine turned on. When I took object 0 off, the machine stayed on. But when I took object 1 off, the machine turned off. Then putting object 1 back on turned it on again. Then when I put object 2 on, the machine turned on as well. \n\nHmm, so object 1 seems to activate the machine by itself. But what about object 2? When I put object 2 alone on the machine, it turned on. So maybe object 2 is also a blicket. But wait, maybe the rule is different. Let me think.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 and 1 together, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it, but removing 1 did. So object 1 is a blicket. Then putting 1 back alone works. Then putting 2 alone also works. So maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets. But what about 0? When I put 0 on alone, nothing happened. So 0 isn't a blicket. \n\nBut the machine turned on when object 2 was placed alone. So that suggests that object 2 is a blicket. So the rule might be that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, then either of them alone activates the machine. But let me test more. \n\nWait, when I put object 2 on the machine alone, the light came on. So that's a clear indication that object 2 is a blicket. So now, the possible blickets are 1 and 2. But what about combinations? For example, if both 1 and 2 are on the machine, does the machine stay on? Let me check. \n\nBut right now, object 2 is on the machine, and the machine is on. If I put object 1 on the machine as well, maybe the machine stays on. Then if I take object 2 off, does it stay on because 1 is still there? Let me try that. \n\nSo next step: put object 1 on the machine while object 2 is already there. Then see if the machine remains on. Then take object 2 off and see if the machine stays on (which it should if 1 is a blicket). \n\nWait, but the user is supposed to output one command. So maybe next command is to put object 1 on the machine again. Let's do that."}

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine turns on when certain objects are placed on it. My goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that activates the machine.\n\nFrom previous steps:\n- Putting object 0 on the machine didn't turn it on. Then adding object 1 made it turn on. When I took off object 0, it stayed on, but removing object 1 turned it off. That suggests object 1 might be a blicket. Then putting object 1 back on alone made it turn on again. Then object 2 was added and the machine turned on. Then adding object 1 again kept it on.\n\nWait, when I put object 2 on the machine alone, the light turned on. Then adding object 1 didn't change anything. So does that mean object 2 is a blicket? But earlier, object 1 alone worked. So maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets. But what's the rule?\n\nWait, let's recap the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put 1 on machine: light on. So either 1 is a blicket, or both 0 and 1 together (but 0 was already on when adding 1 made it turn on. Wait, no. Initially, after putting 0 on, light was off. Then adding 1 made it turn on. Then removing 0 left 1 on, light stayed on. Then removing 1 turned it off. So 1 alone can turn it on, so 1 is a blicket.\n\nThen, putting 2 on the machine: light turned on. So 2 alone can activate it. Then adding 1 again didn't change it. So 2 is a blicket as well. Wait, but if 2 is a blicket, then the rule could be that any blicket on the machine turns it on. So if either 1 or 2 is present, the machine turns on. But what about object 0? When object 0 was on the machine with 1, but removing 0 didn't affect the light. So 0 is not a blicket. Then putting 2 alone activates it, so 2 is a blicket. Then putting 1 and 2 together, the machine stays on. So the rule seems to be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. Since 1 and 2 each individually activate the machine, they must be blickets. Object 0, when placed alone, didn't activate it, so not a blicket.\n\nBut wait, when object 2 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on. Then adding object 1 (already a blicket) kept it on. So the rule is likely that having any blicket on the machine turns it on. Therefore, blickets are 1 and 2. Rule: The machine activates if at least one blicket is on it. But let me check again.\n\nWait, when I first put object 0 on, nothing. Then added 1, light on. Removing 0 didn't affect. So 1 is a blicket. Then putting 2 alone turned it on, so 2 is a blicket. So both 1 and 2 are blickets. The rule is OR: any blicket present activates the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it.\n\nBut to confirm, maybe I need to test if 0 could be part of a different rule. For example, maybe the rule is that two objects together are needed. But when 1 alone works and 2 alone works, that's not the case. So 0 isn't a blicket. So the answer is that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is placed on it."}

Then take 0 off: light remains on. So even without 0, as long as 1 is there, machine stays on. So object 1 alone can activate the machine. Then taking 1 off turns it off. Then putting 1 back on turns it on again. Then putting 2 on alone turns it on. Then adding 1 again, but the light was already on. \n\nSo object 2 alone activates the machine. Object 1 alone does too. Object 0 alone doesn't. So the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But since putting object 0 alone didn't work, but putting 1 or 2 alone did, those are the blickets. Object 0 didn't affect the machine when alone, and even when removed while 1 was present, the machine stayed on, so 0 isn't a blicket. Therefore, object 0 is not a blicket. The answer should be False."}

Then removing 1 turns it off. So when 1 is on alone, the machine is on. Therefore, object 1 is a blicket because its presence is necessary (or sufficient) to activate the machine. Similarly, object 2 on the machine alone activates it. But object 0 didn't when placed alone.\n\nBut the key is mutual information.
