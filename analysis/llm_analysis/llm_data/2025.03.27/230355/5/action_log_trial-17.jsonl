The machine's light is off right now, and all three objects are on the floor. Since blickets affect the machine's state, I need to test different combinations of placing objects on the machine and see when the light turns on.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try putting one object on the machine at a time. Let's begin with object 0. If I put object 0 on the machine and the light turns on, that suggests it's a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. Then repeat for objects 1 and 2. But what if the rule requires more than one blicket? So after testing individual objects, I should test combinations. Like putting two objects together, then all three. Also, check if removing a certain object turns the machine off. That could help identify necessary blickets.\n\nWait, the tip says a blicket's state is not independent of the machine. So mutual information implies that the presence or absence of the object affects the machine's state. So the rule could be something like \"the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it\" or \"all blickets must be on the machine\", or maybe a certain number of blickets. Alternatively, it could be a more complex rule, like an odd number of blickets, but that's probably less likely. Let's start simple.\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. Test each object individually. Put one on the machine, check the light. Then take it off.\n2. If none activate the machine alone, test pairs: 0 and 1, 0 and 2, 1 and 2.\n3. Then test all three together.\n4. If the machine activates in some combination, try removing one object to see if it deactivates, indicating that object is a blicket.\n\nBut since there's a step limit (32), need to be efficient. Let's start step by step.\n\nFirst, put object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens."}

Or maybe there's a different rule. But since putting object 0 alone made it work, perhaps object 0 is a blicket. But I need to check the others.\n\nNow, to test if object 0 is indeed a blicket, but also to check if other objects are involved. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. So if object 0 is a blicket, then putting it alone works. Let's test object 1 and 2 individually.\n\nSo the next step should be to try putting object 1 on the machine. Let's see if that turns it on. If it does, then object 1 is also a blicket. If not, maybe only object 0 is. Similarly for object 2.\n\nBut wait, maybe the rule is different. For example, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket, or a certain combination. But given that when object 0 was on the machine alone, it worked, and removing it turned it off, that suggests that the machine's state is directly dependent on the presence of at least one blicket. So each blicket contributes to activating the machine when present.\n\nSo the next logical steps are to test each object one by one. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine. If the light turns on, then it's a blicket. If not, it's not. Same with object 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But in that case, since object 0 alone made it work, that can't be the case. So likely, the rule is OR: any blicket present activates the machine. So each blicket is sufficient on its own.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, test object 1. Put object 1 on the machine. If the light turns on, then it's a blicket.

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine turns on or off depending on which objects are placed on it. My goal is to find out which ones are blickets and the rule for the machine.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light turned on. Then, when I took it off, the light went off. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket because its presence affected the machine's state. But then I tried object 1 alone, and the machine stayed off. So object 1 might not be a blicket. \n\nWait, but maybe the rule isn't just that a single blicket is enough. Maybe it's a different rule, like needing more than one. Hmm, but when I put object 0 alone, it worked. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the others aren't. But I should test object 2 as well. Let me try putting object 2 on the machine next. If the machine turns on when only 2 is on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe only 0 is. \n\nBut what if the rule is more complex, like needing a combination? For example, maybe two specific objects together activate it. Since object 0 alone worked, but 1 didn't, maybe 0 is a blicket, and 1 isn't. Let me check object 2 next. Then, maybe try combinations. For example, if 0 and 1 are both on, does the machine turn on? Or if 0 and 2 are on. But since the initial test with 0 alone worked, maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is present. So if 0 is the only blicket, then any combination including 0 would activate it. But if 0 isn't present, it doesn't. Let me test that. \n\nBut first, let's check object 2. So next command: put object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe only 0 is. Then, after that, maybe try combining 0 and 1, 0 and 2, etc. But I need to be efficient with steps. Let's see. Step 1: put 0 on, light on. Step 2: take 0 off, light off. Step 3: put 1 on, light off. So 1 is not a blicket. Now step 4: put 2 on machine. Let's see what happens. If light on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe only 0 is. Then, to check if combinations matter. For example, if I put 1 and 2 together, but if neither is a blicket, the machine wouldn't turn on. But if the rule is, say, all blickets must be on, then if there are multiple blickets, but that seems unlikely because 0 alone worked. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when exactly one blicket is on. But that doesn't fit with the previous step. Because putting 0 on alone worked. If there were another blicket, putting both on might deactivate it. But that's more complex. Let's test 2 first. So next command: put object 2 on machine. Let's see."}

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine's light turns on or off depending on which objects are placed on it.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light turned on. Then, when I took it off, the light went off. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket because its presence affected the machine's state.\n\nNext, I tried putting object 1 on the machine by itself, and the light stayed off. So object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. Then I put object 2 on the machine alone, and the light turned on. So object 2 might also be a blicket.\n\nBut now, when both objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. Wait, but object 1 alone didn't activate it. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But since object 2 alone worked, maybe it's a blicket, and object 0 is also a blicket. Then why when both 1 and 2 are on, the light is on? Because 2 is a blicket. So perhaps objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and 1 is not.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. When I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light was on. Then I took it off and tried object 1 alone, light off. Object 2 alone, light on. Then, when both 1 and 2 are on, light is on. That aligns with the idea that 2 is a blicket. So the machine's rule might be that it activates if any blicket is present. Since object 0 and 2 each activate it alone, they are blickets. Object 1 does not.\n\nWait, but what if the rule is more complex, like requiring an even number of blickets? But in the case where only 0 is on, it's one blicket and the machine is on. So that wouldn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket. That seems to fit the current observations.\n\nSo possible blickets: 0 and 2. Rule: The machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But I need to test combinations to confirm.\n\nFor example, putting both 0 and 2 on the machine. If the machine stays on, that's consistent. Also, if putting 0 and 1 together, does the machine turn on? Since 0 is a blicket, the machine should. Let me try that.\n\nWait, I need to plan next steps. Right now, after putting 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is on. So since 2 is a blicket, that makes sense. Now, if I take 2 off and leave 1, the light should go off. Let's try that. Or maybe try adding 0 and 1 together.\n\nAlternatively, take object 1 off, leave 2 on, and see if the light stays on. If yes, then 2 is a blicket. Then try putting 0 and 2 together. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo current state: objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, light is on. If I take object 1 off, the machine should still be on because 2 is a blicket. Let me do that."}

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "Interact with the environment to find the blickets and discover the rule.\nYou are in a room.

So far, here's what I've observed:\n\nWhen I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Then taking it off turned the light off. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket. But then when I put object 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then putting object 2 on the machine made the light turn on again. But after removing object 1 from the machine (which was on there with object 2), the light stayed on. Now, object 2 is still on the machine and the light is on. \n\nWait, let me recap the steps:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light on. Took object 0 off \u2192 light off. So object 0 alone activates the machine.\n2. Put object 1 on machine \u2192 light off. So object 1 alone doesn't activate it.\n3. Then added object 2 on machine \u2192 light on. So with objects 1 and 2 together, light was on. But when I took object 1 off, leaving object 2, the light stayed on. So maybe object 2 alone is enough? But earlier, when I put object 2 on after object 1, the light turned on. Hmm, but maybe object 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket on it. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present, regardless of others. Let's see:\n\nBut when I put object 1 alone on the machine, it didn't activate. Then adding object 2 made it activate. Then removing object 1 (leaving object 2) kept it on. So that suggests that object 2 is a blicket. Because when object 2 is on the machine, the light is on, regardless of object 1. But wait, when I first put object 2 on with object 1, the light turned on. But when I took object 1 off, leaving object 2, it stayed on. So object 2 alone works.\n\nBut what about object 0 and 2. Let me check if both are blickets. When I put object 0 alone, it worked. Object 2 alone works. So maybe both 0 and 2 are blickets. Then the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But then why when I put object 1 and 2 together, the light turned on. Since object 2 is a blicket, that would make sense. Then taking object 1 off, leaving 2, keeps it on.\n\nSo possible blickets: 0 and 2. But I need to confirm. Let me think of other combinations. What if I put 0 and 2 on the machine? The machine would have two blickets. The light should stay on. But I haven't tested that yet. Also, maybe the rule is different. For example, the machine could require exactly one blicket, or an odd number, or maybe all blickets must be on. Wait, but in the initial test, putting 0 alone worked. So if the rule was \"at least one blicket\", then that fits. Similarly, putting 2 alone works. But when I put 1 and 2 on, the machine turned on because 2 is a blicket. Then removing 1 (non-blicket) leaves 2, so stays on. That makes sense.\n\nBut what if the rule is that the machine turns on if the sum of blickets is even, or something else? Let me check. Wait, when object 0 is on alone, it's on. Object 2 alone is on. If both 0 and 2 are on, the machine would still be on. So that's consistent with the \"at least one\" rule. But I haven't tested that yet. Maybe I should test putting both 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, that supports the \"any blicket\" rule. If it turns off, maybe the rule is different. Wait, but I haven't done that yet. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the current state, object 2 is on the machine, and the light is on. If I take object 2 off, the light should turn off. Then, if I put both 0 and 2 on, the light should be on. Let me try that.\n\nBut I need to plan the next steps. The user's last action was a 'look' command, and the current state is: object 2 is on the machine, others on the floor. The light is on. So next steps could be to test adding object 0 to the machine with object 2 already there. If the light remains on, that's consistent. Then take object 2 off, leaving object 0, and see if it stays on. Alternatively, take object 2 off now to see if the light turns off. Then put object 0 back on.\n\nBut maybe I should test the combination of 0 and 2. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 2. Light is on. Let's put object 0 on the machine. If the light stays on, that's expected. Then take object 2 off. If the light remains on (since object 0 is a blicket), that's consistent. Then take object 0 off, light goes off. That would confirm that both 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that the machine requires an even number of blickets, but that's unlikely given previous results. Because with one blicket (0 or 2), the machine was on. But let's see.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine requires exactly one blicket. But then putting two blickets would turn it off. But when I had objects 1 and 2 on the machine, the light was on. If 2 is a blicket and 1 isn't, that would be one blicket. Then removing 1 leaves 2, which is still one blicket, so the light stays on. So that's possible. But if 0 and 2 are both blickets, then putting both on would mean two blickets, which could either keep the light on or turn it off, depending on the rule.\n\nSo to test this, I need to add another blicket (if 0 is a blicket) and see. Let's proceed.\n\nCurrent step: the machine has object 2 on it, light is on. Objects 0 and 1 are on the floor. So next command: put object 0 on the machine. Let's do that.\n\nIf the light stays on, that's consistent with \"any number of blickets\". If it turns off, maybe the rule is \"exactly one\". But given that when both 1 and 2 were on (assuming 2 is a blicket), the light was on, but 1 is not a blicket, so that would still be one blicket. So perhaps the rule is \"at least one blicket is present on the machine\". Then, adding another blicket (object 0) would still keep the light on. Then removing object 2 (a blicket) would leave object 0 (another blicket), so the light stays on. Then removing object 0 would turn it off.\n\nSo if I put object 0 on the machine now, the machine would have both 0 and 2. The light should stay on. Then take 2 off: light should stay on because 0 is still there. Then take 0 off: light turns off. This would confirm that both 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\nSo the next step is to put object 0 on the machine."}

So that's consistent. \n\nI think I've tested all individual objects. The only ones that activate the machine alone are 0 and 2. Object 1 didn't activate it when alone, and when combined with 2 (which does activate), the light stayed on, which is expected. So the rule is the presence of any blicket.

Placing object 2 alone turned the machine on.\n4. Then, when both objects 1 and 2 were on the machine, the light was on. After removing object 1, the light stayed on with just object 2.\n5. Later, adding object 0 again while object 2 was already on the machine kept the light on.\n\nSo, the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. Since object 0 and object 2 individually activated the machine, they are likely blickets. Object 1 didn't activate the machine when placed alone, so it's not a blicket.

So their mutual information is non-zero. That means when the object is on the machine, it affects whether the machine turns on, and vice versa.\n\nLooking at the steps taken:\n\n1. When object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on. Then taking it off turned the light off. So object 0 seems to be a blicket because its presence affects the machine's state.\n\n2. Then object 1 was placed on the machine alone. The light stayed off. So putting only object 1 on the machine didn't activate it. That suggests object 1 isn't a blicket by itself.\n\n3. Next, object 2 was placed on the machine along with object 1 (since after putting object 1, then object 2, the machine turned on. Wait, no. Let me check again. The steps after putting object 1 on the machine (which resulted in the light being off), then putting object 2 on the machine caused the light to turn on. So when both 1 and 2 were on the machine, the light was on. But then when object 1 was taken off, leaving object 2, the light stayed on. Wait, no: after putting object 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding object 2 made the light turn on. Then when they took object 1 off, leaving object 2 on the machine, the light remained on. So object 2 alone keeps the machine on. So object 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut what about object 1? When object 1 was on the machine alone, the light was off. When it was added to object 2 (which was already a blicket), the light was on. But when object 1 was removed, the light stayed on. So adding or removing object 1 didn't affect the machine's state when combined with object 2. Wait, but initially, putting object 1 on the machine alone didn't do anything, and then adding object 2 made it turn on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Since when object 2 is on, the machine is on. Object 0 also turns it on alone. So objects 0 and 2 are blickets. Object 1, when placed alone, didn't activate the machine, so it's not a blicket. Even when placed with object 2, removing it didn't change the state (since object 2 was still there). So object 1's presence or absence doesn't influence the machine's state once the other blickets are considered. Therefore, object 1 is not a blicket."}
