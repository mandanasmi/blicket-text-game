There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. All are on the floor initially. The goal is to determine which are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nFirst, I need to test each object individually. So I'll put one object on the machine and see if the light turns on. That could check if a single blicket is sufficient. \n\nI tried putting object 0 on the machine, then object 1. Both times the light stayed off. Hmm. Maybe the machine requires more than one blicket? Let's try adding object 2 next. If I put all three on, maybe the combination will trigger it. Wait, but maybe it's a specific number, like two. Let's test combinations.\n\nWait, after putting 0 and 1 on, the machine is still off. Maybe 2 is a blicket, but alone. Let me try putting 2 on the machine by itself. If that doesn't work, then maybe the rule involves a combination. Let's check that next. So the next step is to put object 2 on the machine and see. If the light still doesn't turn on, then maybe the rule is that all three are needed, or perhaps a different combination. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires a specific pair. Since putting 0 and 1 didn't work, maybe 0 and 2, or 1 and 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the number of blickets, but only if it's an odd number or something. Let's proceed step by step. First, test each object alone. Then combinations of two, then all three. But since I have limited steps, I need to be efficient. \n\nSince I've already placed 0 and 1 on the machine, adding 2 now would test all three. Let's try that. If the light turns on, maybe all three are blickets. If not, perhaps none are, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are placed. Let's see. So next command should be putting object 2 on the machine. Let's do that."}

The goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. Initially, all are on the floor, and the machine is off.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, still off. But when I placed object 2 on the machine, the light turned on. So putting all three objects on the machine together made it activate. But wait, maybe it's not all three. Let's think: maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when a specific combination is present. \n\nWait, when I put 0 and 1 on, it didn't turn on. Adding 2 made it work. So maybe the presence of object 2 is necessary. But is it sufficient on its own? Let me check that. If I remove 0 and 1, leaving only 2 on the machine, does the light stay on? If it does, then 2 is a blicket. If not, maybe the rule requires all three. But in the current state, all three are on the machine, and the light is on. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket. But when 0 and 1 were on, it didn't turn on, so perhaps they aren't blickets, and 2 is. So putting 2 alone might make it turn on. I need to test that. Let's take objects 0 and 1 off and see if the machine stays on with just 2. If it does, then 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket activates the machine. If not, maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, but the machine turned on when all three were added. But that could be because 2 is a blicket, and the others aren't. Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly three objects are placed. But that's unlikely. Let's try to test individual objects. For example, place only object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, maybe the rule requires multiple blickets. \n\nLet's outline possible steps:\n\n1. Remove all objects except 2 and check if the machine stays on.\nBut the current state is all three are on. So I need to take 0 and 1 off. Let me try that.\n\nTake object 0 off the machine. Then take object 1 off. If the machine remains on with just 2, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the rule requires all three, but that seems unlikely since the machine turned on when 2 was added. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that any blicket's presence activates the machine, but 2 is the only one. \n\nSo, first, take off 0 and 1. Let's see:\n\nAfter putting all three on, the machine is on. Now, take 0 off. If the machine stays on, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then take 1 off. If it's still on, then 2 is the only blicket. If it turns off when removing 1, then 1 is also a blicket. Wait, but earlier when 0 and 1 were on the machine without 2, the light was off. That suggests that neither 0 nor 1 are blickets. So when 2 was added, the machine turned on. Therefore, 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. But to confirm, I need to test with 2 alone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on it. But if 2 is the only blicket, then putting it alone would activate it. Let's test that.\n\nSo the next steps should be:\n\n- Take object 0 off the machine.\n- Take object 1 off the machine.\n- Check if the machine remains on with only object 2. If yes, then 2 is a blicket. If no, then maybe the rule is different.\n\nBut in the current state, all three are on, and the machine is on. Let's proceed.\n\nCommand: take object 0 off machine. Then take object 1 off machine. Then check if machine is still on. But since I can only do one command at a time, need to do step by step.\n\nAfter taking 0 off, if machine stays on, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then taking 1 off. If machine remains on, then 2 is the blicket. If machine turns off after removing 1, that suggests 1 is a blicket. But earlier when 0 and 1 were on, machine was off. So that would contradict, unless the rule requires both 1 and 2. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are placed. But when 0 and 1 were on (two objects), the machine was off, so that's not the case. Then adding 2 (third) made it on. So that's three objects. But that's a possible rule. However, the problem states that the machine's activation is due to blicktness, not the number of objects. So the number of objects might not be the rule, but which objects are blickets.\n\nSo, back to testing. Let's proceed with taking 0 and 1 off."}

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine turns on when certain combinations of these objects are placed on it. My goal is to determine which ones are blickets and the rule that activates the machine.\n\nWhen I first put object 0 on the machine, nothing happened. Then I added object 1, still no light. But when I put object 2 on, the machine turned on. That suggests that maybe having all three together activates it. But wait, when I took object 0 off, the light stayed on. Hmm, that's interesting. So with objects 1 and 2 still on the machine, the light remains on. That might mean that the presence of object 2 is crucial, or that 1 and 2 together are sufficient. \n\nWait, let's recap the steps. Initially, all objects were on the floor. After placing 0, 1, then 2, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 didn't turn it off. So maybe the rule isn't that all three are needed. Maybe it's that at least two are blickets? Let's test that. If objects 1 and 2 are blickets, then putting both on the machine would activate it. Let me check: when I had 0 and 1 on, it didn't activate. Then adding 2 did. If 2 is a blicket, then with 1 and 2, maybe that's enough. But after removing 0, the machine stayed on. So 0 isn't necessary. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates if at least two blickets are present. Wait, but which objects are the blickets? If 2 is a blicket, and maybe 1 is not? Let's think again.\n\nWait, when I had 0,1,2 on the machine, the light came on. Then removing 0 left 1 and 2, and the light stayed on. So perhaps the presence of 2 is enough? Or maybe 1 and 2 together. Let me test further. If I take off 2 now, what happens? Let's try that. Take object 2 off the machine. If the light turns off, then 2 is critical. If it stays on, then maybe 1 is also a blicket. But since when I had 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off, that suggests that neither 0 nor 1 alone (or together) are enough. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. Wait, but when 2 was placed alone (after adding 0,1,2), the machine turned on. Wait, no, because when I added 2, the machine turned on. Wait, the order was: put 0 on (no light), then 1 (no light), then 2 (light on). So adding 2 caused the activation. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2) and the light stayed on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the machine activates when any blicket is present. But why did putting 2 on after 0 and 1 activate it? Because maybe the presence of a blicket (object 2) is sufficient. Then why didn't it activate when 0 and 1 were on? Because they aren't blickets. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. So object 2 is a blicket. Let's test by taking 2 off. If the machine turns off, that would confirm it. Alternatively, if I take 1 off now, leaving 2 on, the machine should stay on. Let me try that. But I need to proceed step by step.\n\nWait, current state: object 0 is off, 1 and 2 are on the machine. The light is on. If I take 1 off, leaving 2, and the light stays on, that would confirm 2 is a blicket. If the light goes off, then maybe both 1 and 2 are needed. Let's try that. So next command should be 'take object 1 off machine' to see. Alternatively, maybe I should check if 2 alone is enough. Let's try putting 2 back on after removing others. But first, in the current state, after removing 0, 1 and 2 are on. The light is on. If I take 1 off, and the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then both 1 and 2 are needed. Let's do that."}

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The goal is to determine which ones are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. \n\nWhen I first put object 0 on the machine, nothing happened. Then I added object 1, still no light. But when I placed object 2 on top, the machine turned on. That suggests that object 2 might be a blicket. But wait, when I removed object 0 and 1, leaving only object 2 on the machine, the light stayed on. Then when I took object 1 off, the light turned off. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the sequence was: put 0 on (light off), then 1 (still off), then 2 (light on). Then take 0 off (light remains on), take 1 off (light turns off). So when objects 1 and 2 were on the machine, the light was on. But when I took 1 off, leaving 2 on, the light turned off? Wait, no. Wait, after putting all three on, the light was on. Then removing 0, light stayed on. Then removing 1, light turned off. So that would mean that with only 2 on the machine, the light is off. But that contradicts the earlier step where adding 2 made the light turn on. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\n1. Put 0 on: light off.\n2. Put 1 on: light still off.\n3. Put 2 on: light turns on. So all three are on, light is on. Then take 0 off: light remains on. Then take 1 off: light turns off. So now only 2 is on, light is off. But when all three were on, the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves 2, but light is off. That suggests that 2 alone isn't enough. So maybe the machine requires at least two blickets to be on it. Let's see. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on, light is on. But when only 2 is on, light is off. Wait, but when I added 2, the light turned on. Wait, but initially, when I added 0, 1, then 2, the light turned on. But after removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, the light goes off. So that's inconsistent. Unless the machine requires all blickets to be present. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are placed. Let's see. Suppose 1 and 2 are blickets. When adding 0 (non), 1 (blicket), then 2 (blicket), the total is two blickets, so light on. Then removing 0 (non) leaves 1 and 2 on, so light stays on. Then removing 1 leaves only 2, which is a blicket, but since only one is present, the light turns off. So that would fit. But then why did adding 2 to 0 and 1 (both non) make the light turn on? Because 2 is a blicket. Wait, if only 2 is a blicket, then putting it on would activate the machine. But when 2 is alone, the light is off. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine requires an odd number of blickets. Let's see. Suppose 2 is the only blicket. When added to 0 and 1 (non), total blickets is 1 (odd), so light on. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves 2 (1 blicket, odd), light should stay on, but in the previous step, after removing 1, the light turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present, but only when it's the last one added. Wait, that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. If there are two blickets (say 1 and 2), then when both are on, light is on. If only one is on, it's off. Let's check the steps:\n\n- Put 0 (non) on: light off.\n- Put 1 (blicket) on: now one blicket. If the rule is all blickets must be on, but there's another blicket (2), then light would stay off. Then adding 2 (blicket) would have both blickets on, light on. Then removing 0 (non) leaves both 1 and 2, light stays on. Removing 1 leaves only 2, which is a blicket, but since the other blicket (1) is off, the light turns off. That fits. So the rule could be that all blickets must be on the machine. Therefore, if 1 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on, light is on. If one is missing, light is off. But how do we confirm this?\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis. Suppose the blickets are 1 and 2. So when both are on the machine, light is on. If either is removed, light off. Let's see:\n\nIn the steps:\n\n- After putting 0, 1, 2 on, light on. Then take 0 off (light stays on because 1 and 2 are still on). Then take 1 off, leaving 2 (and 0 was already off), so light turns off. That fits. So the rule could be that all blickets must be on the machine. Then the blickets are 1 and 2. But wait, when I added 2, the light turned on. Because before adding 2, only 0 and 1 were on. If 1 is a blicket, but 2 is also a blicket, then adding 2 would mean both blickets are on, so light turns on. That makes sense. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So the blickets are 1 and 2. Because when they are both on, the light is on. If one is missing, it's off.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one blicket? Suppose 2 is the only blicket. Then the machine would require that blicket to be on. So when you put 2 on, the light should turn on. But in the previous steps, when 2 was added to 0 and 1 (non), the light turned on. Then when 0 was removed, light stayed on. Then when 1 was removed, leaving only 2, the light turned off. But that contradicts the idea that 2 alone is a blicket. Because if the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is present, then 2 alone should keep it on. But in the case above, removing 1 caused the light to turn off even though 2 was still on. So that suggests that 2 alone isn't enough. Therefore, the rule must be that all blickets must be present. So if there are two blickets (1 and 2), then both must be on the machine. \n\nBut wait, how do we know how many blickets there are? Maybe there are three. Let's test.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But that's not the case because initially, when 0 and 1 were on (two objects), the light was off. Then adding 2 (three objects) turned it on. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when the total number of blickets is odd. Suppose 2 is a blicket. When added to 0 and 1 (non), total is 1 (odd), light on. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves 2, which is 1 (odd), light should stay on. But in the steps, when 1 was removed, light turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let's try to reconstruct the steps again:\n\n1. Put object 0 on: light off.\n2. Put object 1 on: light off.\n3. Put object 2 on: light turns on.\n4. Take 0 off: light remains on.\n5. Take 1 off: light turns off.\n\nSo, after step 3, all three objects are on the machine, light on. After step 4, objects 1 and 2 are on, light on. After step 5, only object 2 is on, light off.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of object 2 alone is not sufficient. But when 1 and 2 are on, the light is on. When 0,1,2 are on, light is on. When 0 and 1 are on, light off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, but only if another condition is met. Wait, but in the case where 1 and 2 are on (assuming they are blickets), the light is on. If either is on, maybe the light is on. Wait, but when only 2 is on, light is off. So that can't be. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on, light is on. If only one is on, light is off. Let's test this scenario.\n\nPutting 0 and 1 (if 1 is a blicket) on: light off (only one blicket). Then adding 2 (another blicket) makes two, light on. Then removing 0 (non) leaves 1 and 2 (two blickets), light on. Then removing 1 leaves 2 (one blicket), light off. That fits. So the rule would be that the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. Then the blickets are 1 and 2. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires at least two blickets. If there are two or more, light on. But then when 1 and 2 are on, light is on. If 2 is on alone, it's off. So that would require that there's only one blicket (2), but that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires the presence of object 2 (a blicket) and at least one other object. But in that case, when 2 and 0 are on, light should be on. Let's test that. Wait, in the steps, after putting 0, 1, 2 on, light is on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) light remains on. Then taking 1 off (leaving 2 alone) light turns off. So if the rule is that 2 must be present along with at least one other object, then when 2 is alone, it's off. That would fit. So the rule could be that object 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires it to be present along with at least one other object (regardless of whether that's a blicket or not). But then, when 2 is on with any other object, the light is on. For example, if 0 and 2 are on, light should be on. But in the initial steps, when 0 was on alone, light off. Then adding 1 (non) and 2 (blicket) made the light on. Then removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, light off. But if the rule is 2 plus any other, then when 2 and 1 are on, light should be on. Which it was. But if only 2 and 0 are on, would that also work? We haven't tested that yet. Let me try to think.\n\nBut according to the current steps, when 1 and 2 are on, light is on. But if the rule is 2 and any other, then that's the case. However, we need to test if 0 and 2 would also work. Let's simulate:\n\nIf the user does:\n\nput 0 on machine (light off)\n\nput 2 on machine (now 0 and 2 are on. If rule is 2 and any other, light should turn on. But according to the previous steps, when 0,1,2 were on, light was on. Then after removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2), light stayed on. Then removing 1 (leaving 2 alone) light turned off. So that fits the idea that 2 must be present with at least one other object. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when object 2 is on the machine along with at least one other object. In that case, object 2 is a blicket, and the others are not. But why would the machine require 2 plus another object? That's possible. But then the blicket is 2, and the rule is that it needs to be with another object. However, the problem states that blicktness is inside the objects, and the machine's rule depends on their blicktness. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present, and one of them is 2. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on the machine, and there are two blickets (1 and 2). Let's see:\n\n- When 0,1,2 are on, both 1 and 2 are present (assuming they're blickets), so light on. Removing 0 (non) leaves 1 and 2, light remains on. Removing 1 leaves only 2, so not all blickets (since 1 is missing), so light off. That fits. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 2. Because when both are on, light is on. If either is missing, light is off.\n\nBut how do we confirm that? We need to test other combinations. For example, if we put 1 and 2 on the machine, the light should be on. If we take 1 off, it should turn off. Let's see:\n\nIn the current state after step 5, the machine has object 2 on the floor (since after taking 1 off, light is off). So perhaps the next step is to test putting 1 and 2 back on.\n\nBut I only have 32 steps, so need to be efficient. Let's try putting 1 and 2 on again.\n\nSo the next command would be to put object 1 on the machine again. Then check if the light turns on. Then put object 2 on again. Wait, but maybe object 2 is already on the machine? Let me check the previous steps.\n\nWait, after taking object 1 off the machine, the light turned off. At that point, objects on the machine: initially, after step 3, all three were on. Then step 4: take 0 off, so 1 and 2 are on. Step 5: take 1 off, so only 2 is on. So now, 2 is on the machine, but light is off. So putting 1 back on the machine would make 1 and 2 on. According to the hypothesis, this should turn the light on. Let's try that.\n\nCommand: put object 1 on machine. If light turns on, that supports the idea that both 1 and 2 are blickets. Then, take 2 off. If light turns off, that confirms it. Alternatively, if putting 1 back on makes light on, then taking 1 off again should turn it off.\n\nBut given the step limit, I need to test efficiently. So next command should be to put object 1 on the machine. If light turns on, then we can infer that 1 and 2 are needed. Then take 2 off and see if light remains on (if not, then both are required). \n\nBut let's see. If the user does:\n\n> put object 1 on machine.\n\nThen the machine has objects 1 and 2 on. If the light turns on, that supports the hypothesis that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present. Then taking 2 off would leave 1 on, light should turn off. Then taking 1 off, light remains off. \n\nAlternatively, if the machine's rule is that any blicket is present, but in the previous steps, when 2 was alone, light was off. So that's not the case. So the likely rule is that all blickets must be present. \n\nAnother possibility is that the machine requires the presence of at least one blicket, but only when another condition is met. For example, if the machine requires an even number of blickets. But that's getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when the sum of the blicktness is a certain value. For example, each blicket contributes 1, and the machine needs a sum of at least 2. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then sum is 2, which activates the machine. If only one is present, sum is 1, which doesn't. \n\nBut given the observed steps, the most straightforward rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. The blickets are 1 and 2. \n\nTo confirm, the next step is to put 1 back on the machine. If the light turns on, that's a good sign. Then, take 1 off and see if it turns off. \n\nAlternatively, another test: put 2 on alone (light off). Then put 1 on (light on). Then take 2 off (light off). That would confirm that both are needed. \n\nBut currently, after the last step, object 2 is on the machine, and the light is off. So if we put object 1 on the machine now, the machine will have 1 and 2. If the light turns on, that supports the hypothesis. \n\nSo the next command should be:\n\n> put object 1 on machine.\n\nIf the light turns on, then it's likely that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present. Then, to further test, take object 2 off and see if the light turns off. If yes, then the rule is confirmed."}

So 0 isn't necessary once others are there.\n- Remove 1: light goes off. So with only 2 on, the light is off. Then putting 1 back on turns it on again. So with 1 and 2, the light is on.

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine turns on when certain combinations of these objects are placed on it.

Then, when I took off object 0, the light stayed on. But when I took off object 1, the light turned off. Then putting object 1 back made it light up again. Then removing object 2 also turned it off. Hmm, so maybe the machine requires at least two blickets to be on it? Or perhaps each object has a certain weight and their combined blicktness needs to meet a threshold.\n\nWait, let's recap the steps:\n\n1. Put 0,1,2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n2. Take 0 off \u2192 light remains on.\n3. Take 1 off \u2192 light off.\n4. Put 1 back \u2192 light on.\n5. Take 2 off \u2192 light off.\n\nSo, when only 1 is on the machine, the light is on. But when only 2 is on, it's off? Wait, no. Let me check again. After step 3, after removing 1, the machine had 2 and 0 was already off. Wait no, after step 1: all three on, light on. Then take 0 off \u2192 light stays on (so 1 and 2 are on). Then take 1 off \u2192 only 2 is left, and the light turns off. Then putting 1 back (so 1 and 2 on) turns it on again. Then taking 2 off leaves only 1 on, and the light is off. Wait, but when you took 2 off after step 5, the light turned off. So that suggests that when 1 is alone, it's off. But when 1 and 2 are together, it's on. So maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and both need to be on the machine. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Let's test that. Let's try putting 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then that would support that both are blickets. Then taking either off would turn it off. But in the previous steps, when 1 and 2 were on, the light was on. Then taking 1 off (leaving 2) turned it off. Taking 2 off (leaving 1) also turned it off. So perhaps both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both need to be present. Wait, but if that's the case, then putting both 1 and 2 on the machine should turn it on. Let's check that.\n\nBut in the initial step, when all three were on, it was on. Then when 0 was removed, leaving 1 and 2, it stayed on. Then removing 1 turned it off. So that suggests that 1 and 2 together activate the machine. But when only 1 is on, it's off. When only 2 is on, it's off. So the rule might be that the machine requires at least two blickets. But in that case, maybe 0 isn't a blicket, and 1 and 2 are. Because with 1 and 2 on, it's on. If 0 was a blicket, then having 1 and 2 (two blickets) would activate. But also, when all three were on, which includes 0, it was on. But maybe 0 isn't a blicket. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when any two blickets are on it. But then if 1 and 2 are the only blickets, then two of them would activate it, and three (including non-blicket 0) would also activate. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. But then if 1 and 2 are blickets, putting them both on would activate. But putting all three (including non-blicket 0) would still activate. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of blicktness must be >= some value. For example, each blicket has a value of 1, and the machine requires at least 2. So if 1 and 2 are blickets (each 1), then their sum is 2, which activates. If 0 is not a blicket, then when all three are on, sum is still 2 (since 0 adds 0), which activates. That would fit. So the rule could be that the sum of blicktness is >=2. Then the blickets would be 1 and 2.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis. Let's try putting 1 and 2 on the machine. The light should turn on. Then take one off, and the light should turn off. Let's check the previous steps. When all three were on (sum 2), light on. Take 0 off (still 1 and 2, sum 2), light on. Then take 1 off (only 2, sum 1), light off. Then put 1 back (sum 2 again), light on. Then take 2 off (only 1, sum 1), light off. So yes, this fits.\n\nSo, the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine activates when the total blicktness (number of blickets) on it is at least 2.\n\nBut wait, in the initial step, when all three were on, including 0, the sum was 2, so the light was on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves sum 2, still on. So yes, that makes sense. Therefore, objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when two or more blickets are placed on it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. But in that case, adding a third (non-blicket) wouldn't affect it. But in our case, adding 0 didn't change the activation. So the rule could be \"at least two blickets\". So the blickets are 1 and 2.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think of other possibilities. For example, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. If there are two blickets (1 and 2), then putting both on would activate. Putting one would not. Putting all three (including non-blicket 0) would still activate. But in the previous steps, when only 1 was on (after removing 2), the light was off. So that fits. So the rule would be that all blickets must be on the machine. But in that case, if there are two blickets, both need to be on. So when both are on, it's on. If one is missing, it's off. That also fits the observations. So the rule could be \"all blickets must be on the machine\". But in that case, the number of blickets is two (1 and 2). Let's check:\n\nPutting 1 and 2 on \u2192 machine on. Putting 0 as well doesn't affect. Taking 0 off doesn't change. Taking 1 off \u2192 machine off. Putting 1 back \u2192 machine on. Taking 2 off \u2192 machine off. So this also fits. So the rule could be either \"all blickets must be on the machine\" or \"at least two blickets are on\". How can we differentiate?\n\nLet's see: If the rule is \"all blickets must be on the machine\", then if there are two blickets, both must be on. If the rule is \"at least two\", then even if there's a third blicket, putting two would activate. But in our case, we only have three objects, and the tests so far suggest that 1 and 2 are the only blickets. So both rules would fit the observations. But how can we tell?\n\nWait, in the initial test when all three were on the machine, the light was on. If the rule was \"all blickets must be on\", then putting all three (including non-blicket 0) would still have all blickets (1 and 2) on, so the light is on. Then, removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 and 2, which are both blickets \u2192 light stays on. Then removing 1 (a blicket) \u2192 only 2 is on \u2192 light off. Then putting 1 back \u2192 both blickets on \u2192 light on. Then removing 2 \u2192 only 1 \u2192 light off. So this fits the \"all blickets must be on\" rule. But if there was a third blicket, say 0, then the rule would require all three. But in our case, the tests don't require that. So perhaps the rule is \"all blickets must be on the machine\", and the blickets are 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be \"exactly two blickets are on the machine\", but that doesn't fit because if there are two blickets, putting both on would satisfy, but adding a third non-blicket wouldn't affect. So the light would stay on. Which matches the initial observation.\n\nBut wait, the difference between \"all blickets must be on\" and \"exactly two\" would matter if there are more blickets. But in this case, we only have three objects. Let's suppose that 0 is not a blicket, and 1 and 2 are. Then, \"all blickets must be on\" would require both 1 and 2. If we put both on, the light is on. If we put one, it's off. If we put both plus 0, it's on. That matches the observations. So the rule is \"all blickets must be on the machine\".\n\nBut how can I confirm? Let's think of an experiment. Suppose I put object 1 on the machine. If the light is off, then that suggests that 1 alone isn't enough, which is the case. Then put object 2 on. The light turns on. Then take 1 off. The light turns off. So that supports the \"all blickets must be on\" rule. Because if the rule was \"at least one\", then putting 1 or 2 would suffice. But in this case, neither alone works. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are placed on it.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: maybe the machine requires exactly two objects to be on, regardless of which ones. But in the initial step, putting three objects on the machine turned it on, so that's not the case. So that's ruled out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets. But when two are on, it's on. When one is on, it's off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires at least one blicket. But in the case where only 1 is on, the light was off. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the most likely scenario is that the rule is all blickets must be on the machine, and the blickets are 1 and 2. But how can I confirm that there are only two blickets? Let's test putting 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then taking one off turns it off. Which is what happened earlier. So yes, that supports the rule.\n\nAnother test: put 1 and 2 on. Light should be on. Then put 0 on as well. Light stays on. Then take 0 off. Light remains on. Which is what happened earlier. So yes, adding non-blicket doesn't affect. Therefore, the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, and the blickets are 1 and 2.\n\nSo the answer should be that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are placed on it."}

So, from the steps taken, here's what happened:\n\nFirst, all objects were on the floor. The user started putting each object on the machine one by one. When they placed object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. But when they added object 2, the light turned on. That suggests that adding object 2 made the machine activate.\n\nThen, the user removed object 0, and the light stayed on. Then they removed object 1, and the light turned off. That implies that with only object 2 on the machine, the light was on (since after removing 0, the machine stayed on, but after removing 1, it turned off\u2014wait, no. Wait, let's recheck:\n\nAfter putting all three on, the machine turned on. Then they took off 0, and the light stayed on. Then took off 1, and the light turned off. So with objects 2 and 1 on, the machine was on. Wait, no: after taking off 0, the machine remained on. Then taking off 1 (leaving only 2 on) made the light go off. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, original steps:\n\nPut 0,1,2 on machine: light turns on.\n\nTake 0 off: light remains on.\n\nTake 1 off: light turns off. So when only object 2 is left on the machine, the light is off. Then putting object 1 back on (so objects 1 and 2 are on), light turns on. Then taking 2 off leaves only 1 on, and the light turns off.\n\nHmm. So when objects 1 and 2 are both on, the machine is on. But when only 2 is on, it's off. When all three were on, it was on. When 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. Because after putting 0 and 1, light was off. Then adding 2 made it on.\n\nSo the rule might be that the machine activates if at least two blickets are present. Or perhaps a specific combination.\n\nWait, when 0 and 1 were on (before 2 was added), the machine was off. So 0 and 1 alone don't activate it. Then adding 2 made it on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and at least one other? But when 1 and 2 are on, the machine is on. So if 2 is a blicket, then 1 must also be a blicket. Because 2 alone didn't keep it on (when 0 was removed, then 1 was removed, leaving 2, the light turned off). Wait, no. Let me go step by step.\n\nAfter putting all three on, the light was on. Then:\n\n- Take 0 off: light stays on (so objects 1 and 2 are on). So 1 and 2 together activate the machine.\n\n- Then take 1 off: light turns off. So only object 2 is left, and it's off. So object 2 alone doesn't activate the machine.\n\n- Then put 1 back on: now objects 1 and 2 are on again, light is on.\n\n- Then take 2 off: only object 1 is on, light turns off. So 1 alone doesn't activate.\n\nSo the machine only turns on when both 1 and 2 are on. That suggests that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both need to be present. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If there are two blickets (1 and 2), then both must be on. So the machine activates if all blickets are present on it. Since when both are on, it's on. If either is removed, it's off.\n\nSo, in this case, objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and object 0 is not. Because when 0 was on the machine with 1 and 2, the machine was on, but removing 0 didn't affect the state (since 1 and 2 were still on). So object 0 is not a blicket.

So 0 isn't a blicket, because removing it didn't affect the light. Then removing 1 caused the light to turn off, even though 2 was still on. That suggests that 2 alone isn't a blicket. But when 1 is put back on (so only 1 and 2), the light comes on again. So maybe 1 and 2 are both blickets. Because having both on makes the light work. But when only 1 is on (after taking 2 off), the light is off. So maybe the rule is that all blickets need to be on the machine? If there are two blickets (1 and 2), then both need to be on. Let's check that scenario.\n\nIf the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine to activate it, then:\n\n- When all three are on (assuming 0 isn't a blicket), then the presence of 1 and 2 (the blickets) would activate the machine. Then taking 0 off doesn't matter. But when you take 1 off, now only 2 is on, but since both blickets (1 and 2) need to be on, the machine turns off. Then putting 1 back on (with 2) turns it on again. Then taking 2 off leaves only 1, so again, not all blickets (since 2 is a blicket), so machine turns off. That would imply that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So in that case, the answer would be True, object 1 is a blicket. But let me check another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that at least one blicket is needed. But in that case, when only 2 was on (after removing 1 and 0), the light should stay on if 2 is a blicket. But when I took 1 off (leaving 2 on), the light went off. So that suggests that 2 alone isn't a blicket. So perhaps the rule is that exactly object 1 is a blicket. Wait, but when I put 1 back on (after removing 2), the light was on again. Wait no, let me check the steps again.\n\nWait the steps were:\n\n- After putting all three on, light on.\n- Take 0 off \u2192 light on.\n- Take 1 off \u2192 light off. So with 2 on, light off. So 2 alone doesn't activate.\n- Put 1 on (now 1 and 2 are on) \u2192 light on.\n- Take 2 off \u2192 light off (only 1 is on).\n\nIf the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is on, then if 1 is a blicket, having it on alone should activate the machine. But when only 1 was on (after taking 2 off), the light was off. That contradicts that. So the rule can't be OR. Alternatively, maybe it's AND: two blickets need to be present. If 1 and 2 are both blickets, then when both are on, the machine activates. If either is missing, it turns off. That fits the observations. So when 1 and 2 are on, machine is on. When only one is on, machine is off. So the rule would be that the machine turns on when all blickets are on. But if there are two blickets (1 and 2), then they both must be on. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be present. So in this case, the question is whether object 1 is a blicket. Based on the above, yes. So the answer is True."}

The user tried putting each object on the machine one by one. When they put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. But when they added object 2, the light turned on. Then, they started removing objects to see which ones affected the light.\n\nWhen they took object 0 off, the light stayed on. But when they took object 1 off, the light turned off. Then putting object 1 back made the light come on again. Removing object 2 also turned the light off. This suggests that both object 1 and 2 are necessary for the machine to activate. Wait, but when all three were on, the light was on. Then removing 0 didn't change it. Then removing 1 turned it off. But when they put 1 back, the light turned on again (with 1 and 2 on the machine). Then removing 2 turned it off. So maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 need to be on the machine. But when they had all three on, maybe the presence of 0 didn't affect it. So the key is that 1 and 2 together activate the machine. Wait, but initially, when they added 2, all three were on. But then after removing 0 and 1, adding 1 again made it work. Let me check the steps again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine. Light off.\n2. Put 1 on machine. Light off.\n3. Put 2 on machine. Light turns on. So all three are on.\n4. Take 0 off. Light stays on.\n5. Take 1 off. Light turns off. So with only 2 on, it's off.\n6. Put 1 back on. Light on. Now 1 and 2 are on the machine.\n7. Take 2 off. Light turns off.\n\nSo when 1 and 2 are both on, the machine is on. If either is removed, it turns off. So the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. Therefore, both are blickets. But the question is specifically about object 2. Since the machine only turns on when 2 is present (in combination with 1), then yes, 2 is a blicket. The rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Since both 1 and 2 are needed, they're both blickets. Therefore, the answer for object 2 is True."}
