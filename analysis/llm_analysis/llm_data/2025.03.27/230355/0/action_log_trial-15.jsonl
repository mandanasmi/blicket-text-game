Let's recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, all three objects (0, 1, 2) are on the floor. The machine's light is off. I tried putting object 0 on the machine first, and the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. Hmm, interesting. So maybe adding object 1 made the machine activate. But I need to test more to understand the rule.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then adding object 1 made it turn on. So maybe object 1 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. But maybe there's more to it. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when exactly two objects are on it, but that doesn't fit because when I added object 1, making two objects on the machine (0 and 1), the light turned on. But let's check: after putting 0 on, the light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So maybe object 1 is a blicket, and object 0 is not. But I need to test other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on when any blicket is placed on it. But when I put object 0 alone, it stayed off. So 0 isn't a blicket. Then when I added 1, it turned on. So 1 is a blicket. But what about object 2? Let's test that. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. So if 1 is a blicket, then putting 1 on the machine should activate it. Wait, but when I first put object 0 on, then 1, the machine turned on. So perhaps even with 0 (non-blicket) and 1 (blicket) together, the presence of 1 is enough. But maybe the rule is different. Let's think of other possibilities: maybe all objects on the machine must be blickets. In that case, since 0 isn't a blicket (since putting it alone didn't work), adding 1 (a blicket) wouldn't make all of them blickets. So that's probably not the case. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But then putting 1 on alone should work. Wait, but I didn't try that yet. Let's test that.\n\nWait, I should try putting object 1 on the machine alone. Let me see. Let's take off object 0 and 1 first. Wait, but right now, both 0 and 1 are on the machine, and the light is on. So if I take off object 0, leaving 1, the light might stay on if 1 is a blicket. Or if the machine requires both 0 and 1, but that's less likely. Let me try taking off object 0. So the command would be 'take object 0 off machine'. If the light stays on, then 1 alone is sufficient, which would confirm that 1 is a blicket. If the light turns off, then maybe the combination is needed. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of some property (like weight) meets a threshold. But since we're dealing with blickets, it's more likely a presence-based rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, regardless of other objects. So if 1 is a blicket, putting it on alone should activate the machine. Let me test that. First, I need to take off object 0 and 1. Wait, currently, they are both on the machine. Let me take off object 0 first. So:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nAfter that, only object 1 is on the machine. If the light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the combination of 0 and 1 is needed, but that's less likely. Let me see what the result is. But since I can't actually perform the action here, I need to simulate based on previous steps.\n\nWait, originally, after putting 0 on, light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So if after removing 0, the light would still be on if 1 alone is sufficient. But maybe the machine's state updates when objects are added or removed. So let's proceed.\n\nBut in the current state, both 0 and 1 are on the machine, and the light is on. If I take off 0, the machine would have only 1. If the light remains on, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the presence of both 0 and 1 is required. But since 0 alone didn't activate the machine, it's unlikely that 0 is a blicket. So the most plausible is that 1 is a blicket, and the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. Then object 2 might be a blicket or not. Need to test that.\n\nWait, but maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. Or maybe when an even number of blickets are present. Or something else. Let's test.\n\nFirst, check if 1 alone activates the machine. To do that, take off 0 and leave 1. Then see if the light is on. If yes, then 1 is a blicket. Then test 2. Let's proceed.\n\nSo, step 1: Take object 0 off the machine.\n\nIf the light remains on, then 1 is a blicket. Then, take 1 off and put 2 on to see if 2 is a blicket. If the light turns on when 2 is added, then 2 is a blicket. Alternatively, if the light doesn't turn on, then 2 isn't.\n\nAlternatively, if after removing 0, the light turns off, that would imply that both 0 and 1 are needed, but that's unlikely because 0 alone didn't work.\n\nBut given that adding 1 after 0 turned the light on, but 0 alone didn't, it's more likely that 1 is a blicket. So let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nNext, test object 2. Maybe put 2 on the machine alone. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then it's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present, regardless of other objects. So if 1 is a blicket, then even if other non-blickets are present, the machine will activate. So in the previous step, when 0 and 1 were both on, the machine turned on because of 1. Then taking 0 off would leave 1, so the machine should stay on.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested that yet. So the next logical step is to take 0 off and see.\n\nSo, command: take object 0 off machine\n\nIf the light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. Then, take 1 off, put 2 on, and see if the light turns on.\n\nIf the light goes off when 0 is removed, that would suggest that both 0 and 1 are needed, but that's confusing because 0 alone didn't work. So that scenario is less likely.\n\nAssuming the light stays on after removing 0, then 1 is a blicket. Then, take 1 off (light turns off), and put 2 on. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then only 1 is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another rule. For example, the machine requires all blickets to be on it. But if there are multiple blickets, maybe all must be present. But with three objects, perhaps the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the machine might activate if exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But when I put 0 on first, the machine stayed off (only one object). Then adding 1 made it two objects, so light turned on. But if that's the case, then putting any two objects would activate it. But I need to test that. For example, put 0 and 2 on. If the light turns on, then the rule is based on the number of objects. But if not, then it's about the presence of specific objects (blickets).\n\nSo, after the current state where 0 and 1 are on the machine and the light is on, taking 0 off would leave 1. If the light stays on, then the number of objects isn't the rule. If it turns off, then maybe the rule is two objects. But that's conflicting because putting 0 alone didn't work. Wait, no: if the rule is that exactly two objects are needed, then putting two non-blickets would activate it. But in this case, 0 and 1 (if 1 is a blicket) would activate it. But if the rule is two objects, regardless of type, then putting any two would work. But when I put 0 and 1, the light turned on. Let's test with two non-blickets. For example, 0 and 2. If the light turns on, then the rule is based on the number. If not, then it's based on the presence of blickets.\n\nBut I need to test this. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, take object 0 off the machine. So current objects on machine: 1. If light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. Then take 1 off, put 0 and 2 on. If the light turns on, then the rule is two objects. If not, then the presence of at least one blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is even, or some other condition.\n\nBut given the initial tests, the most straightforward hypothesis is that at least one blicket is required, and 1 is a blicket. Then, object 2 may or may not be.\n\nSo, after removing 0, if the light stays on, then 1 is a blicket. Then remove 1 (light turns off), then put 2 on alone. If light turns on, 2 is a blicket. If not, then 2 isn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. But with three objects, that's possible. For example, if all three are blickets, then putting all three would activate it. But that's more complex. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state: objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, light is on.\n\nCommand: take object 0 off machine\n\nResult: only object 1 on machine. If light is on, then 1 is a blicket.\n\nAssuming that's the case, next step: take object 1 off machine (light turns off). Then put object 2 on machine. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then not.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. So if both 1 and 2 are blickets, putting both would turn it off. But that's more complex. But initial steps suggest that adding 1 to 0 turned it on, so maybe 1 is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that the number of blickets is odd. But this is getting too complicated without enough data.\n\nSo, the next steps should be:\n\n1. Take object 0 off machine to see if light stays on with just 1.\n2. If yes, then 1 is a blicket.\n3. Then take 1 off, put 2 on to test 2.\n4. Also, test combinations, like putting 0 and 2, to see if the light turns on.\n\nBut since step count is limited (32 steps), need to be efficient.\n\nBut in the current state, after putting 0 and 1 on the machine, the light is on. The user has used 7 steps so far (including the initial looks and commands). Let's proceed.\n\nSo, the next command should be 'take object 0 off machine' to check the effect.\n\nAssuming that after taking 0 off, the light remains on, then 1 is a blicket. Then take 1 off (light turns off). Then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then 2 isn't.\n\nAlternatively, if after taking 0 off, the light turns off, that would imply that both 0 and 1 are needed. But that's unlikely because 0 alone didn't activate the machine.\n\nSo, proceeding with the command to take 0 off."}

So there are three objects here: 0, 1, and 2. The machine turns on when certain combinations of these objects are placed on it. My goal is to determine which are blickets and the rule that activates the machine.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine, nothing happened. Then adding object 1 made the machine turn on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving just object 1, the machine turned off. Wait, that's confusing. Let me recap:\n\n- Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n- Then put object 1 on machine: light on.\n- Take object 0 off: light off. So with only object 1 on the machine, it's off again.\n\nHmm. So maybe the presence of both 0 and 1 together caused the machine to turn on? But when I removed 0, it turned off even though 1 was still there. That suggests that both 0 and 1 might be necessary? But that contradicts the initial observation where putting 0 alone didn't do anything, then adding 1 turned it on. Wait, but when I took 0 off, the machine turned off even though 1 was still there. So maybe the rule is that the machine stays on only if all the blickets are present. Or maybe it's an AND condition where both 0 and 1 are blickets. Wait, but why did adding 1 make it turn on when 0 was already there? Let me think again.\n\nWhen I put 0 on first, machine was off. Then adding 1 made it turn on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. So maybe both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine for it to activate. That would imply both are blickets. But why didn't the machine turn on when I first put 0 on? Because maybe 0 alone isn't enough. So the rule could be that all blickets must be on the machine. If both 0 and 1 are blickets, then having both on activates it. But then why when I took 0 off, leaving 1, it turned off. That makes sense if both are required. So maybe the rule is that all blickets must be present on the machine. But how many blickets are there? Let's test further.\n\nNow, after taking 0 off, the machine is off. Let me try putting 1 back on again. Wait, but 1 was already on the machine. Wait no, when I took 0 off, maybe I took the wrong object. Wait, the commands were: put 0 on, then 1 on. Then take 0 off. So after taking 0 off, machine has only 1 on it. And the light turned off. So that suggests that 1 alone isn't enough. But when both 0 and 1 were on, the light was on. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be present. But what about object 2? I haven't tested it yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is present. But in that case, if 1 is a blicket, then putting 1 on alone should activate it. But when I put 1 on after 0, maybe the machine checks the combination. Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nFirst, put object 0 on machine: light off. Then put object 1 on machine: light on. So when 0 and 1 are both on, it's on. Then take 0 off: light off. So with just 1, it's off. So that suggests that the presence of both 0 and 1 is needed. So both might be blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But what if there are more? Like maybe 2 is also a blicket. Let me test.\n\nNow, the machine has object 1 on it (since I took 0 off). The light is off. Let me put object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, that would suggest that 1 and 2 are blickets. But I need to see.\n\nSo next command: put object 2 on machine. If the light turns on, then maybe 1 and 2 together are the triggers. If not, perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine must be odd, or some other function. But given the initial test, 0 alone does nothing, 0+1 activates, then removing 0 deactivates. That suggests that 0 and 1 together are necessary. So perhaps they are both blickets and the rule is that all blickets must be present. But if there's a third blicket (object 2), then adding it would require all three to be on. But I need to test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any blicket on the machine activates it, but only if no non-blickets are present. Or some other combination.\n\nWait, another possibility: the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But in that case, putting 1 on after 0 would have activated it because 1 is a blicket. Then when taking 0 off, leaving 1, the machine should stay on. But in the previous step, taking 0 off made the machine turn off. So that contradicts that hypothesis. Unless 0 is the only blicket, but adding 1 somehow interferes. That seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. But there are three objects. Hmm.\n\nI need to test more combinations. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state: Objects 1 and 2 are on the floor. The machine has object 1 on it (wait, no: the last action was taking object 0 off the machine. So the machine had objects 0 and 1. After taking 0 off, the machine has only object 1. Then, when the light turned off. So now, machine has object 1 on it, and the light is off. Wait, but when I put 1 on, the machine's light turned on. Wait, no: let me check the history again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. put object 1 on machine: light on.\n3. take object 0 off: light off.\n\nSo after step 3, the machine has object 1 on it, and the light is off. That suggests that with only object 1, the machine is off. So maybe object 1 is not a blicket? But when added to object 0, the machine turned on. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two objects are placed on it. So putting 0 and 1 (two objects) made it turn on. Then removing one (leaving one) turned it off. But that's a possible rule. But then, if I put two objects that are not blickets, would it activate? Or maybe the number of blickets among the placed objects must meet a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when any two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But let's test that. If I put 0 and 2 on, does the machine activate? If yes, then the rule is based on the number of objects. But if not, then it's based on the specific objects.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present, but when object 0 is not a blicket. So when I added object 1 (a blicket) to 0 (non-blicket), the machine activated. But when I removed 0, leaving only 1, maybe there's a different rule. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try to test other combinations. Let's start fresh by removing all objects from the machine.\n\nCurrent state: Object 1 is on the machine (from the previous step), and the light is off. Let's take object 1 off the machine.\n\nCommand: take object 1 off machine. Then, the machine is empty. Then, try putting object 1 alone on the machine. If the light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's part of a combination.\n\nBut wait, previously when I put 0 and 1 on, the light turned on, but when only 1 was left, it turned off. So maybe 1 is not a blicket, but in combination with 0 (which is also not a blicket), the machine turns on. That would be a different rule, like the sum of their weights or something. But this is a blicket problem, so likely the rule is about the presence of specific objects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the total number of blickets on it is even or odd. For example, if there are two blickets (0 and 1), putting both on makes the number even, so the machine activates. But when you take one off, it becomes odd, so it deactivates. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: test each object individually.\n\nFirst, take object 1 off the machine (current state: machine has object 1). So after taking 1 off, machine is empty.\n\nThen, put object 0 on machine. Did the light turn on? Earlier, when I put 0 on, it didn't. So light remains off. Then, put object 1 on alone. If light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then it's not. Let's try.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on, the light was on, but when only 1 was left, it was off. So maybe 1 is not a blicket, but 0 and 1 together activate the machine through some interaction. Alternatively, maybe 0 is not a blicket, but 1 is, but the machine requires at least two objects to activate. So if only 1 is on, it's not enough. But if 1 and another object (even non-blicket) are on, then the machine activates. But that complicates the rule.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that exactly one blicket is present. But when you put two objects, one of which is a blicket, it activates. Wait, but in that case, if you put 1 (a blicket) alone, it should activate. Which contradicts the previous observation.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure the tests systematically.\n\nTest 1: Put object 0 alone on machine. Result: light off. \u2192 0 is not a blicket, or not sufficient.\n\nTest 2: Put object 1 alone on machine. Let's do this. Current state: machine is empty. So next command: put object 1 on machine. If light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then maybe it's part of a combination.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when I added 1 to 0, the light turned on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. So if 1 alone doesn't activate, but 0 + 1 does, then maybe both are blickets, and the rule is that at least one must be present. Wait, no: because if both are blickets and the rule is at least one, then 1 alone should activate. But in the previous steps, when only 1 was left, the light was off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternative rule: all blickets must be on the machine. Suppose there are two blickets (0 and 1). Then, if both are on, the machine activates. If either is removed, it deactivates. So in that case, putting both 0 and 1 on activates, taking either off deactivates. Then, if there's a third blicket (2), we need to check.\n\nBut how to confirm. Let's test 1 alone.\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 1 (after taking 0 off). The light is off. So when I put 1 on alone, the light is off. Therefore, 1 is not a blicket. But when 0 and 1 are both on, the light is on. So perhaps 0 is a blicket and 1 is a non-blicket, but the rule is that exactly one blicket is present. Wait, but then putting 0 alone should activate it. Which it didn't. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the number of blickets is even. Suppose 0 and 1 are both blickets. Putting two (even) activates. Taking one off (odd) deactivates. But in that case, putting 1 alone (odd) would not activate. But then, putting 0 alone (odd) also doesn't activate. So this could fit. But then the rule is that the number of blickets must be even. So if there are two blickets, putting both activates. If there's a third blicket (object 2), then putting all three would be odd (3) and not activate. Putting two of them would activate. But we don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But then, if 0 is a blicket, putting it alone should activate. But in the first test, putting 0 alone didn't. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is more complex. Like, the machine activates if the sum of the blicktness of the objects on it meets a certain threshold. For example, each blicket has a value of 1, and non-blickets 0. The machine activates if the sum is \u22652. So, if 0 and 1 are both blickets, their sum is 2, which activates. If only one is on, sum is 1, which doesn't. But then, if 0 is a blicket and 1 is not, sum would be 1 (0 is 1, 1 is 0) when both are on. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe each blicket has a different weight. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's test object 2.\n\nCurrent state: Machine is empty. Let's put object 2 on the machine.\n\nCommand: put object 2 on machine.\n\nIf the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then it's not. If the light remains off, then maybe 2 is not a blicket, or needs to be combined with others.\n\nAfter putting 2 on, if light is off, then test combining with others. For example, put 2 and 0 on the machine. If light turns on, maybe 0 and 2 are blickets. Or put 2 and 1 on.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent step: machine has object 1 (from previous steps?), wait no. After the last step, after taking 0 off, machine had object 1. Then the light was off. Then the user tried to take object 1 off, but I'm not sure. Wait, the previous commands were:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine. (light off)\n2. put object 1 on machine. (light on)\n3. take object 0 off. (light off)\n\nSo now, machine has object 1. Light is off.\n\nNext, take object 1 off machine to empty the machine.\n\nCommand: take object 1 off machine.\n\nThen, put object 1 on machine again. If light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then maybe it's part of a combination.\n\nSo:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nNow machine is empty. Then:\n\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nIf light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then it's not.\n\nAssuming that after putting 1 alone, the light is off, then 1 is not a blicket. But when combined with 0, the light turned on. So maybe 0 is a blicket and 1 is not. Wait, but when 0 was alone, the light was off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when two objects are placed, regardless of which ones. But earlier, putting 0 and 1 (two objects) activated it. Let me check that. When I put 0 on, then 1 on (total two), the light turned on. When I took 0 off, leaving one, it turned off. If I put two objects on, regardless of which, the machine activates. But then putting 1 and 2 on should also activate it.\n\nSo let's test that. After taking all objects off, put 1 and 2 on the machine.\n\nBut let's follow through.\n\nCurrent state: machine is empty. Let's put object 1 on.\n\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nIf light remains off, then 1 alone isn't enough. Then put object 2 on machine. If light turns on, then the rule is based on the number of objects (two or more). If not, then it's based on specific combinations.\n\nAlternatively, if the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, putting both activates. If I put 1 and 2, and neither is a blicket, it doesn't. But I need to know.\n\nBut this is getting too long. Let me summarize possible steps:\n\n1. Test each object individually.\n2. Test pairs to see which combinations activate.\n3. Test all three together.\n\nSo far, we know:\n\n- 0 alone: off\n- 0+1: on\n- 1 alone: off\n\nPossible next steps:\n\n- Test 2 alone.\n- Test 0+2.\n- Test 1+2.\n- Test 0+1+2.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nFirst, take all objects off the machine. Currently, after the previous steps, machine has object 1 (from earlier step). So:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nNow machine is empty. Then:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. Let's assume it's off. Then, put object 0 and 2 on. If light turns on, maybe 0 and 2 are a valid pair. But without knowing, I need to test.\n\nBut in the initial tests, putting 0+1 activated. So perhaps the rule is that exactly objects 0 and 1 together are blickets. Or perhaps the machine activates when any two objects are placed, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present, but only when placed with another object (non-blicket). For example, if 1 is a blicket, but needs to be placed with any other object. So 1+0 activates, 1+2 activates, but 1 alone does not. But why would the rule require another object? That's possible but less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates if the sum of blickets is exactly two. So if there are two blickets among the three, putting any two would activate. But we need to know which are the blickets.\n\nAnother angle: the machine's light turns on when the objects on it have a combined weight that meets a threshold. But this is a blicket problem, so it's more about presence rather than quantities.\n\nLet me try putting object 2 on the machine now.\n\nAfter taking all objects off, put object 2 on machine:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf the light remains off, then 2 is not a blicket. Then, put object 0 and 2 on. If the light turns on, maybe 0 is a blicket and requires another object. But earlier, 0 alone didn't work. Or maybe 0 and 2 are both blickets. But if 0 is a blicket, why didn't it activate when alone?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to hypothesize.\n\nFrom previous steps, the only combination that worked was 0+1. So maybe both are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there are only two blickets (0 and 1), then putting both activates. If there's a third, then all three must be on. But we need to test with object 2.\n\nSo next step: put 0, 1, and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then maybe all three are blickets, but that's unlikely because adding 2 might not change the state. Alternatively, if the light stays on, then the rule is that the presence of 0 and 1 is sufficient regardless of 2. If the light is still on with all three, then 2 is not a blicket. If it turns off, then perhaps the rule requires exactly 0 and 1.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state: machine is empty.\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put object 1 on machine: light on.\n3. Put object 2 on machine: check if light stays on or turns off.\n\nIf light stays on, then 2 is not a blicket, and the rule is that 0 and 1 together activate it. If light turns off, then adding 2 interferes, implying a different rule.\n\nBut let's try this.\n\nBut first, need to get back to the state where 0 and 1 are on the machine.\n\nSo steps:\n\n> put object 0 on machine (light off)\n> put object 1 on machine (light on)\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf the light remains on, then adding 2 doesn't affect it. So the rule is that having 0 and 1 on the machine activates it, regardless of other objects. Thus, 0 and 1 are blickets. If the light turns off when adding 2, then the presence of 2 disrupts it, which would imply a different rule, maybe an XOR situation, but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that exactly two objects are on the machine, regardless of which. But if I add 2, making three, the light turns off. So the rule is that exactly two objects activate it. But earlier, putting two (0 and 1) activated it. Putting a third (2) deactivates. But this is possible. However, if the rule is based purely on the number of objects, then any two should activate it, regardless of which. So let's test that by putting 1 and 2 on the machine.\n\nBut this is getting too long. Let me try to proceed with the next command.\n\nIn the current state, after taking object 0 off, the machine has object 1, light is off. Then, taking object 1 off, machine is empty. Now, let's test object 2.\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nAssuming the light remains off, then object 2 alone doesn't activate. Then, put object 0 and 2 on. If light turns on, maybe the rule is that any two objects activate it, which would mean the number of objects is the key. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on (two objects), it activated. If 0 and 2 (two objects) also activate, then the rule is that exactly two objects must be present. Then, putting three would turn it off again.\n\nAlternatively, if putting 0 and 2 doesn't activate, then the rule is that specific objects (0 and 1) must be present.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nCurrent step: machine is empty.\n\n> put object 2 on machine. Let's say light is off.\n\nThen, put object 0 on machine (now two objects: 0 and 2). If light turns on, then the rule is based on the number of objects (two). If not, then specific pairs.\n\nIf it turns on, then any two objects work. Then, the blickets might not be relevant, which contradicts the problem statement. But the problem says that blickets have blicktness that makes the machine turn on. So the rule must involve the blickets.\n\nThus, the previous assumption that the rule is about the number of objects is incorrect. Therefore, the machine's activation depends on the presence of specific objects (blickets).\n\nSo back to the earlier test where 0 and 1 together activated the machine, but individually they did not. This suggests that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there's a third blicket (object 2), then adding it would require all three to be on. But we need to test.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. If there are two blickets (0 and 1), putting both activates. If there's a third, say 2 is a blicket, then any two of them would activate.\n\nBut without knowing, let's test.\n\nAfter putting 0 and 1 on the machine, light is on. Then add 2. If light stays on, then 2 is not a blicket. If it turns off, then the rule might require exactly two blickets. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that the sum of the blicktness is odd. For example, if there are two blickets (even), the machine is off. If three (odd), it's on. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the limited steps, perhaps the safest conclusion is that objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Object 2 is not a blicket. To confirm, I need to test object 2 in combination with others.\n\nFor example, put objects 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light doesn't turn on, then 2 is not a blicket. If it does, then 0 and 2 are both blickets, and the rule might be that at least one is present. But earlier tests contradict that.\n\nAlternatively, put 1 and 2 on the machine. If light turns on, then perhaps 1 and 2 are blickets, but that would mean the earlier test with 0 and 1 was coincidental. Less likely.\n\nSo, next steps:\n\n1. Take object 1 off the machine (if still on).\n2. Put object 0 and 2 on the machine to see if that activates.\n\nBut to save steps, let's proceed.\n\nCurrent state: machine is empty after taking all objects off.\n\n> put object 0 on machine (light off)\n> put object 2 on machine (now two objects: 0 and 2). Check light.\n\nIf light turns on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. If not, then only 0 and 1 are.\n\nAssuming the light remains off when 0 and 2 are on, then 0 and 1 are the blickets. But why does their combination work? Maybe the rule is that exactly those two are needed. Thus, the rule could be that the machine activates if both 0 and 1 are on it, regardless of others. Or that all blickets must be on, and the blickets are 0 and 1.\n\nBut how to confirm?\n\nAnother test: put object 1 and 2 on the machine. If light doesn't turn on, then only 0 and 1 together work.\n\nAlternatively, if the light turns on with 1 and 2, then the rule might require at least one blicket, and 1 and 2 are blickets. But earlier steps contradict that.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the step limit, perhaps it's best to tentatively conclude that objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. Object 2 is not a blicket. But to confirm, test putting 0 and 1 again.\n\nAfter taking all off:\n\n> put object 0 on machine (light off)\n> put object 1 on machine (light on) \u2192 confirms the combination works.\n\nThen take object 1 off \u2192 light turns off. Take object 0 off.\n\nThen put object 1 on \u2192 light remains off. So 1 alone doesn't work.\n\nThus, the rule seems to be that both 0 and 1 must be on the machine for it to activate. Therefore, they are both blickets. Object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nBut what if there's another rule, like the machine activates when two specific non-blickets are placed together? Unlikely, given the problem statement.\n\nThus, the answer is likely that objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets (0 and 1) are placed on it."}

The goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. \n\nFirst, I tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving just 1, the light turned off. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, no. Let me check the previous steps again.\n\nWait, the user said: \n\n- Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n- Then put object 1 on machine \u2192 light turned on.\n- Then took object 0 off \u2192 light off.\n- Took object 1 off \u2192 light still off.\n\nSo, when both 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on. But when I removed 0, leaving 1, the light went off. That suggests that maybe having both 0 and 1 is needed? Or perhaps 1 alone is a blicket, but the rule requires more than one? Or maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. Wait, but when I put 0 and 1 on, the light came on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1) made it go off. So maybe 1 is a blicket, but 0 isn't. Wait, but if 1 alone isn't enough, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. Wait, but when I put 0 and 1 on, it turned on. If 1 is a blicket, then even if 0 isn't, the presence of 1 should activate it. But when I took 0 off, leaving 1, the light went off. That contradicts that. So perhaps the machine requires all objects on it to be blickets. Wait, but then when I put 0 and 1 on, if either wasn't a blicket, the machine wouldn't turn on. Hmm, but in that case, the machine turned on when both 0 and 1 were on. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets. But then taking 0 off would leave 1, which is a blicket, so the machine should stay on. But in the previous steps, when only 1 was left, the machine turned off. That suggests that the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are on it. So if 0 and 1 are both blickets, then putting both on activates it. Removing one (either) would leave only one, so the machine turns off. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But there are three objects. Wait, but in this case, the user only tested 0 and 1. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when any blicket is present. So if 1 is a blicket, putting it on alone should activate the machine. But in the previous steps, when I put 0 and then 1, the light turned on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) caused the light to turn off. That would suggest that 1 alone isn't sufficient, which would contradict the idea that any blicket activates it. So perhaps the rule is that the sum of the blickets' \"blicktness\" needs to meet a certain threshold. For example, each blicket contributes 1, and the machine needs at least two. So if both 0 and 1 are blickets, their sum is 2, which activates the machine. But when only 1 is present, the sum is 1, which isn't enough. That could be a possible rule. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So if there are two blickets (say 1 and 2), then both need to be on. But in the previous test, 2 wasn't involved. Let's see.\n\nWait, the user hasn't tested object 2 yet. Let me check the steps again. The initial state was all objects on the floor. Then:\n\n- Put 0 on machine: light off.\n- Put 1 on machine: light on.\n- Took 0 off: light off.\n- Took 1 off: light off.\n\nSo when both 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on. When only 1 was on (after removing 0), light turned off. That suggests that having both 0 and 1 on the machine activates it, but individually they don't. So perhaps both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that at least two blickets need to be on the machine. Alternatively, the rule could be that exactly two blickets must be present. But in that case, if 0 is not a blicket and 1 is, then putting 1 and another non-blicket (say 0) wouldn't activate it. But in the test, putting 0 and 1 activated it. So that would imply that both 0 and 1 are blickets. But then removing 0 would leave 1, which is a blicket, so if the rule is at least one, the machine should stay on. But in the test, it turned off. So that suggests that the rule requires two or more blickets. So 0 and 1 are both blickets. Then, when only one is on, the machine doesn't activate. So the rule is that the machine activates when two or more blickets are on it. But then, what about object 2? Maybe it's not a blicket. Let's test that. \n\nSo next, I should test object 2. Maybe put 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket, and the rule is two or more. If not, then maybe 0 and 1 are the only blickets. Alternatively, if the rule is that the machine activates only when all blickets are on it. But since there are three objects, and the user hasn't tested all, perhaps there's another scenario. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. Wait, but in the previous test, when both 0 and 1 were on, the machine was on, but when only 1 was left, it turned off. That would contradict that rule. \n\nSo the next step is to test other combinations. Let's try putting object 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, that would suggest that 1 is a blicket, and 2 is also a blicket (if the rule is two or more). Alternatively, if putting 1 and 2 on doesn't activate the machine, then maybe only 0 and 1 are blickets. \n\nWait, but when 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on. So if 1 is a blicket and 0 is not, then perhaps the machine activates when a blicket is present along with another object. But that seems less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when any blicket is present, but if a non-blicket is also present, it deactivates. So if 1 is a blicket, and 0 is not, then putting 1 alone would activate it, but putting 1 and 0 (a non-blicket) would deactivate it. But in the previous test, putting 0 and 1 activated the machine. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's try to outline the possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: Machine activates when at least one blicket is present.\n\n- If 1 is a blicket, putting 1 on alone should activate it. But when 1 was on the machine alone (after removing 0), the light was off. So this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: Machine activates when exactly two blickets are present.\n\n- Then, 0 and 1 must both be blickets. When both are on, the machine is on. If only one is on, it's off. Then, to confirm, putting 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is also a blicket. But since there are only three objects, the rule could be exactly two, so if two of any blickets are on, it activates. Or the rule could be that all blickets must be present. \n\nBut the user hasn't tested object 2 yet. Let's proceed to test that. \n\nSo next command: put object 2 on the machine. Let's see what happens. Then, check if the machine turns on. If it does, that suggests that 2 is a blicket. Then, combine with others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the total number of blickets on it is odd. Or some other rule. \n\nBut given the previous results, the most likely scenario is that the machine requires at least two blickets. So 0 and 1 are blickets, and when both are on, the machine turns on. Then, when only one is on, it's off. \n\nBut what about object 2? Let's test it. \n\nSo next step: put object 1 on the machine again. Then, put object 2 on. If the light turns on when 1 and 2 are on, then 2 is also a blicket. If not, then maybe 2 is not a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, put object 1 on, see if the light turns on. Then add object 2 and see if it stays on or turns off. \n\nWait, earlier when object 0 and 1 were on, the light was on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So putting 1 alone didn't activate it. Therefore, 1 alone isn't enough. So maybe the rule is that two or more blickets must be present. So 0 and 1 are blickets. \n\nBut let's test object 2. \n\nPutting object 1 on machine: light remains off? Because in previous steps, when 0 was removed, leaving 1, the light turned off. So putting 1 alone now would result in light off. Then adding object 2: if light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then 2 is not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if exactly two blickets are present, regardless of which ones. So if 1 and 2 are both blickets, putting them on would activate it. \n\nSo the next steps should involve testing object 2 in combination with others. \n\nSo first, put object 1 on the machine. If the light is off, then add object 2. Let's see what happens. \n\nAlternatively, put object 2 on first. Let's try that. \n\nSo command: put object 2 on machine. \n\nIf the light remains off, then maybe 2 is not a blicket. Then, add object 1. If the light turns on, that would suggest that 1 and 2 are blickets. But wait, in previous steps, putting 0 and 1 on the machine activated it. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets, and 2 is not. \n\nBut I need to confirm. \n\nSo possible plan:\n\n1. Put object 1 on machine. (Light off)\n2. Put object 2 on machine. (If light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 2 isn't a blicket.)\n3. Then test other combinations. \n\nBut let's proceed. \n\nThe previous steps were:\n\n- After taking both 0 and 1 off, all objects are on the floor. \n\nSo now, the machine is empty. \n\nNext command: put object 1 on machine. \n\nIf the light turns on, that would mean that 1 alone is a blicket. But in the previous test, when 0 and 1 were on, the light was on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) made it turn off. So putting 1 alone now would not turn it on. \n\nSo after putting object 1 on the machine, the light remains off. Then, put object 2 on. If the light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets (assuming the rule is two or more). If not, then perhaps 2 isn't a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, if putting 1 and 2 on the machine activates it, then the rule is that two or more blickets are needed, and both 1 and 2 are blickets, along with 0. But that would require three blickets, which seems possible. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to execute these steps. \n\nCurrent state: all objects are on the floor. \n\nFirst, put object 1 on machine. \n\nThen, check if light is on. If not, then put object 2 on. \n\nAssuming the light remains off when 1 is alone, then adding 2. If light turns on, that suggests that 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is two or more. \n\nAlternatively, if the light doesn't turn on with 1 and 2, then maybe 0 and 1 are the only blickets. \n\nSo the next commands would be:\n\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nAssuming the light is off. Then:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. \n\nBut in the previous case, putting 0 and 1 on activated the machine. If 0 is a blicket, then adding 2 would mean that if 2 is a blicket, putting 0,1,2 all on would activate it. But perhaps the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. \n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the presence of any two blickets activates the machine. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I need to proceed. \n\nSo the next step is to put object 1 on the machine again. Let's see."}

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. There are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine's light turns on when certain combinations are placed on it. \n\nEarlier, when I put object 0 and then 1 on the machine, the light turned on. Wait, no. Wait, first I put object 0 on the machine, light stayed off. Then I put object 1 on, and the light turned on. Then when I took off object 0, leaving object 1, the light turned off. Then I took off object 1, and later put it back alone, but the light stayed off. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, let's recap the steps:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put object 1 on machine: light turns on.\n3. Took object 0 off: light turns off (so now only object 1 is on machine, but light is off).\n4. Took object 1 off: light remains off.\n5. Then put object 1 back on machine: light stays off.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Maybe there's a timing issue or a different rule. Let's check the exact responses again.\n\nAfter putting object 0 on machine, the light is off. Then adding object 1, the light turns on. Then removing object 0 (so only 1 is left), the light turns off. Then removing 1, light off. Then putting 1 back alone, light is off. So maybe the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on at the same time? Because when both were on, the light was on. But when only 1 was on, it turned off. Then when putting 1 back alone, it's off. But that would suggest that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But there's also object 2 to consider.\n\nWait, but when I first put 0 on, then 1, the light came on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So the presence of 1 alone isn't enough. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But that doesn't fit. Because when I had 0 and 1 on, the light was on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1) turned it off. So that would mean that 1 alone isn't a blicket. But when I added 1 after 0, the light came on. So maybe the combination of 0 and 1 together activates it. But that would imply a rule where two objects together are needed, but which ones?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps object 0 is not a blicket, and object 1 is. But when I put 1 alone, the light is off. So that doesn't make sense. Unless the rule is that the machine only activates when exactly one blicket is on, but that's contradicted. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. Let's see. If 0 and 1 are both blickets, then putting both on would turn it on. But if only one is on, it's off. Then when I put 1 back alone, it's off. But what about object 2? Maybe 2 is also a blicket. Let's test.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on if an even number of blickets are on it, or something like that. But this is getting complicated. Let's try more experiments.\n\nSo far, the steps I've taken are:\n\n- Put 0 and 1 on: light on.\n- Remove 0: light off (only 1 left).\n- Remove 1: light off.\n- Put 1 back alone: light off.\n\nSo maybe the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. But then, why did adding 1 after 0 trigger the light? Because when I put 0 on, light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So the combination of 0 and 1 activates it. But then, if both are blickets, why does the machine turn on when both are present? Or maybe one of them is a blicket, but the other is not. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when I put 0 on, light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So if 1 is a blicket, then putting it on should activate the machine even alone. But when I put 1 alone, the light is off. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the previous steps. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. put object 1 on machine: light turns on.\n3. take object 0 off: light turns off.\n4. take object 1 off: light remains off.\n5. put object 1 on machine: light stays off.\n\nSo when object 0 and 1 are both on, light is on. When only 0 is on, light off. When only 1 is on, light off. When both are off, light off. Then putting 1 on again, light stays off. So that suggests that the machine only turns on when both 0 and 1 are on. Therefore, the rule might be that both 0 and 1 are blickets and both need to be on the machine. But then, what about object 2? Maybe 2 is not a blicket. Or maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the sum of some property (like weight) of the blickets on the machine must reach a threshold. But with only three objects, it's more likely a logical combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. If 0 and 1 are blickets, then putting both on would work. But then, if 2 is also a blicket, putting 0 and 2 on would also work. But I need to test that.\n\nSo next step: test object 2. Maybe put object 2 on machine alone. If light stays off, then put object 2 with 0 or 1.\n\nLet's try putting object 2 on the machine now. Current state: all objects are on the floor. The previous steps ended with putting 1 on machine and light off. Then took 1 off. Now, I can try putting 2 on machine alone.\n\nSo command: put object 2 on machine. Let's see if the light turns on. If it does, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then maybe in combination with others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is present. But in that case, when I put 0 on (assuming 0 is not a blicket), then 1 (a blicket) would activate it. But when I put 1 alone, it didn't. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. So if there are multiple blickets, all must be present.\n\nBut with three objects, perhaps 1 and 2 are blickets. Let's test.\n\nAnother approach: to test each object alone. So:\n\n- Test object 0 alone: put 0 on machine. Light off. So 0 is not a blicket, or the rule requires more than one.\n\n- Test object 1 alone: put 1 on machine. Light was off in previous step (when put 1 on after removing 0). So 1 alone doesn't activate it.\n\n- Test object 2 alone: let's do that now. Put object 2 on machine. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, maybe 2 isn't, or needs to be combined.\n\nAfter that, if 2 alone doesn't work, try combining 2 with others.\n\nSo next action: put object 2 on machine."}

Initially, all objects were on the floor. The user tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then they added object 1, and the light turned on. When they removed object 0, the light went off, and removing object 1 also kept it off. But then when they put object 1 back alone, the light didn't turn on. Adding object 2 with object 1 also didn't work.\n\nWait, that's confusing. When both 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on. Removing 0 made it turn off. But when only 1 was put back, the light stayed off. Maybe the rule isn't that either 0 or 1 is a blicket. Maybe both need to be present? Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst interaction: put 0 and 1 on machine \u2192 light on. Then remove 0 \u2192 light off. Remove 1 \u2192 light off. Then put 1 back alone \u2192 light off. Then add 2 \u2192 light still off. So when 0 and 1 were together, the machine turned on. But individually, neither 0 nor 1 activated it. Hmm, that suggests that both 0 and 1 might need to be on the machine together for it to activate. But when they were both on, the light was on. Then removing either turned it off. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires all blickets to be present. But wait, in the first case, putting 0 then 1 made it turn on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So maybe the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But when only 1 was put back, it didn't activate. Wait, that contradicts that. So maybe 1 is a blicket, but the machine only activates when exactly one blicket is present. But then when 0 was added first (which may not be a blicket) and then 1 (a blicket), the machine turned on. But then removing 0 (non-blicket) made the machine turn off even though 1 was still there. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when there's an even number of blickets. But with 0 and 1 on, maybe both are blickets (even count), but then removing 0 (leaving 1) would be odd, so off. But when they tried putting 1 back alone, it's odd, so off. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) doesn't change. But this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's re-examine each step:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n2. Then put object 1 on machine \u2192 light turns on.\n3. Take object 0 off \u2192 light off.\n4. Take object 1 off \u2192 light off.\n5. Put object 1 back on \u2192 light remains off.\n6. Put object 2 on \u2192 light remains off.\n\nSo the only time the light turned on was when both 0 and 1 were on the machine. That suggests that the combination of 0 and 1 together activates the machine. So the rule could be that the machine activates when both 0 and 1 are present. That would mean they are both blickets. But then why does putting 1 alone not work? Because both are required. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If 0 and 1 are the only blickets, then the machine only activates when both are on. Let's test this hypothesis. If I put 0 and 1 on again, the light should turn on. Let me try that. But the user already did that. After step 2, the light was on. Then removing 0 made it off. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly both 0 and 1 to be on. Then object 2 is not a blicket. Alternatively, perhaps the machine requires at least two blickets. But if 0 and 1 are both blickets, then two are present. If only one is there, it's not enough. But when the user put 0 first, then 1, the light turned on. That fits. Then removing either makes it drop below two. But then, what if there's a third blicket? But in this case, there are only three objects. Let's see. If the rule is that the machine activates when two or more blickets are present, then 0 and 1 could both be blickets. But when the user added 2, but the light stayed off, so 2 is not a blicket. So the blickets are 0 and 1. The rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Wait, but in the first case, adding 0 (non-blicket?) and then 1 (blicket) would only be one blicket. But the light turned on. So that contradicts. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present. But then when 1 was alone, why didn't it activate? Because when the user first put 0 on, then 1, and the light turned on. Then when they took 0 off, leaving 1, the light turned off. That suggests that the presence of 1 alone is not enough. So maybe the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be present. Therefore, they are both blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there are more than two blickets, that would complicate it. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates if exactly one blicket is present, but that doesn't fit here. Let's see another angle: when 0 and 1 are both on the machine, the light is on. When either is removed, it's off. So perhaps the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets and the machine requires both to be present. That would make sense. Then, the user can test by putting both again. But in the current state, after putting 1 and 2, the light is off. So the next step should be to try putting 0 and 1 again. If the light turns on, then the hypothesis holds. So the command would be to put object 0 on the machine again, then check if adding 1 turns it on. Alternatively, the user can try putting 0 and 1 together again. Let's proceed accordingly."}

So far, when I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light turned on. Wait, no. Let me recap the steps.\n\nFirst, I put object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. Then I took both off. Then I tried putting object 1 back on, but the light stayed off. Then added object 2, still off. Then added object 0 again, and the light came on. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the exact sequence:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put object 1 on machine (now 0 and 1 are on): light turns on.\n3. Take 0 off: light turns off. Take 1 off: light off.\n4. Put 1 back on: light off. Then put 2 on: still off. Then put 0 on, making all three (0,1,2) on the machine: light turns on again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after taking both 0 and 1 off, then putting 1 back on, then 2, then 0. So the order was 1, then 2, then 0. When 0 was added, the light turned on. So maybe the combination of 0 and 1 makes the light turn on, regardless of others? Or maybe object 0 is a blicket, and object 1 is a blicket, but only when both are on the machine. Let me check.\n\nWait, when I first put 0 on alone: nothing. Then adding 1 made it turn on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. Then putting 1 back alone didn't work. Then adding 2 and 0 again. When I added 0 to 1 and 2, the light turned on. Wait, maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. But when 0 was on alone, the light was off. Hmm, that contradicts. Unless the rule requires exactly two blickets. Or maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, another possibility: the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is odd. Let's see. If 0 and 1 are blickets, then two blickets (even) would turn it off. But when 0 was on alone, light was off. If 0 is a blicket, then 1 on (with 0) would make two. But that didn't turn it on. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let's try to reconstruct the steps again step by step.\n\nFirst command: put object 0 on machine. Result: light off. So if 0 is a blicket, then one blicket isn't enough. Or maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Then put object 1 on machine. Now both 0 and 1 are on. Light turns on. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But then, when 0 is removed, the light turns off. Then when 1 is removed, light remains off. Then putting 1 back on alone doesn't work. Then adding 2 and 0 again. Wait, when 0 is added again (with 1 and 2 already on), the light turns on. So maybe 0 is a blicket and 1 is not. Let's see: when 1 is alone, light off. When 0 and 1 are together, light on. Then when 0 is removed, light off. Then when 0 is added again, light on. But if 0 is the only blicket, then putting 0 on alone should turn it on. But in the first step, putting 0 alone didn't work. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present. Let's say 0 and 1 are blickets. When both are on, it's two, so light on. If either is removed, it's not two. Then, when I put 0 back with 1 and 2 (assuming 2 is not a blicket), the total is two blickets (0 and 1), so light on again. But in that case, even with 2 on the machine, it's still two blickets. So that would make sense. So maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed, and 0 and 1 are blickets. But then, when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. So that's possible. But why when I put 1 and 0 on again (after putting 2 and 0), it works. Because 0 and 1 are the two blickets. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are on it, regardless of others. Then, in the first case, 0 and 1 (two blickets) would activate. Then, when 0 is removed, only 1 (one blicket) left. Then, putting 1 back, adding 2 (non-blicket), then adding 0 again makes two blickets (0 and 1), so activates. That makes sense. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when two or more blickets are on it. But then, if there are three blickets, putting all three would also activate. But in this case, when I put 0,1,2 on, the machine turned on. But maybe 2 isn't a blicket. Let's see: when I put 1 and 2 on, the light was off. Then adding 0 made it on. So if 0 is a blicket, and 1 is not, then with 0 and 1 and 2, the total blickets would be 1 (only 0). So that wouldn't activate. But the light did turn on. So that's a problem. So that suggests that 1 must be a blicket as well. Let me try again.\n\nScenario 1: Objects 0 and 1 are blickets. Rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Then when 0 and 1 are both on, the light turns on. If either is removed, it turns off. When I added 0 again with 1 and 2, since 2 is not a blicket, but 0 and 1 are both on, the light turns on. So that works. But then, in the first step, putting 0 alone didn't activate. Because the rule requires all blickets to be present. So if there are two blickets (0 and 1), then both must be on. But when I put 0 on and then 1, it activated. When 0 was taken off, it deactivated. So that fits. Then, when I put 1 back on, and then 2, then 0, the machine has all three, but only 0 and 1 are blickets. So the rule is that all blickets must be present. Therefore, the machine activates when all blickets are on it. So in this case, the blickets would be 0 and 1, because when both are on, the machine is on. When either is missing, it's off. When 2 is added, it doesn't matter. So in the last step, after adding 0, 1, and 2, the machine is on because both 0 and 1 are present. That fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but only if placed in a certain order. But that seems more complicated.\n\nAnother test: If I put object 0 and 2 on the machine, what happens? If the rule requires both 0 and 1 to be on, then adding 0 and 2 should not activate. But if I put 0 and 2 on, then maybe the light stays off. But I haven't tried that yet. Let me see. In the current state, the machine has 0,1,2 on it, and the light is on. If I take 1 off, then 0 and 2 remain. If the light turns off, that supports the idea that both 0 and 1 are needed. But I haven't done that yet. Since the user is limited in steps, maybe I should try that.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, when 1 was on alone, the light was off. When 0 was added, it turned on. Then when 0 was removed, light off. Then when 1 is removed, light off. Then putting 1 back on, then 2, then 0: adding 0 made it turn on again. So the presence of 0 and 1 together activates the machine, regardless of 2. So that suggests that the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires both to be on. Therefore, the rule is that all blickets must be present on the machine. The blickets are 0 and 1.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present. Let's see: If 0 and 1 are blickets. Putting 0 (1 blicket, odd) should activate. But when 0 was put on alone, the light stayed off. So that's not possible. If the rule is that two blickets are needed (even), then when 0 and 1 are on, it's even, so activates. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) and 0 again (so 0 and 1 on, total two) would activate. That fits. But then, if the rule is exactly two, but if there are three blickets, but in this case, perhaps there are only two. So the rule could be that the number of blickets on the machine is even, but that doesn't fit with the initial step where 0 alone (if it's a blicket) would be odd. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present, but only if another condition is met, like the presence of a non-blicket. But that seems more complex.\n\nThe most straightforward explanation is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires both to be present. Therefore, the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets (0 and 1) are on it, regardless of other objects. Object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nSo to confirm, if I take object 1 off the machine now (since currently all three are on and the light is on), the machine should turn off. Let me try that. But I need to do this in the next steps. However, the user has limited steps. But since the user can exit early if they understand the rule, maybe I should proceed to exit once I have enough confidence.\n\nBased on the experiments so far, the activation occurs when both 0 and 1 are on the machine. So they are the blickets. The rule is that all blickets must be present on the machine for it to activate."}

So, the machine turns on based on some rule involving the blickets. From the actions taken, let me go through each step.\n\nFirst, when object 0 was put on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then object 1 was added, and the light turned on. When both 0 and 1 were on the machine, it was on. Then, taking off 0 made the light go off. Taking off 1 also left it off. Then putting 1 back on alone didn't turn it on. Adding 2 to 1 also didn't. But when 0 was added again (with 1 and 2 on the machine?), the light came back on. Wait, the order might matter here.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n2. Put object 1 on machine \u2192 light on.\n   So, with 0 and 1 on, light is on.\n3. Take 0 off \u2192 light off. So removing 0 caused it to turn off. That suggests 0 might be a blicket, because when it's present with 1, the machine is on, but removing it turns it off. But maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 are needed. Wait, but then when only 1 was on the machine again later (after taking both off), putting 1 back alone didn't turn it on. So maybe 1 alone isn't enough. Then when 0 was added again (after 1 and 2 were already on?), the light turned on. Wait, let me check the exact sequence:\n\nAfter taking both 0 and 1 off, the user puts 1 on again (light off). Then puts 2 on (still off). Then puts 0 on again, which makes the light turn on. So in that case, objects 0,1,2 are all on the machine? Or just 0 and 1 and 2?\n\nWait, after taking 0 and 1 off, the steps are:\n\n- Put 1 on machine \u2192 light off. So only 1 is on, light is off.\n- Put 2 on machine \u2192 now 1 and 2 are on. Light still off.\n- Put 0 on machine \u2192 now all three are on. Light turns on.\n\nSo when all three are on, the light is on. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on, it was on. When only 1 and 2 were on, it's off. Adding 0 to 1 and 2 makes it on. So maybe the rule is that the presence of object 0 and at least one other (either 1 or 2) is required. Or perhaps the machine requires at least two blickets, and object 0 is a blicket. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if object 0 is present. But when 0 was alone on the machine initially, the light was off. Then when 1 was added, it turned on. So that can't be. So maybe 0 and 1 are both blickets. When they are both on the machine, the light is on. But when 0 was added again later with 1 and 2, the light turned on. Wait, but in that case, when 1 and 2 were on (without 0), the light was off. Then adding 0 made it on. So perhaps 0 is a blicket, and any other object (1 or 2) being a blicket as well. But then, when 0 and 1 are on, machine is on. When 0 and 2 are on, machine should be on. But in the test case, when 0 was added to 1 and 2, the machine turned on, but we don't know if that's because of 0 and 1, or 0 and 2, or all three. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, putting both on would activate it. But when 0 is on alone, no. When 1 is on alone, no. When 0 and 1 are on, yes. Then later, when 1 and 2 are on, no. Adding 0 (making 0,1,2 on) would still have two blickets (0 and 1) so maybe the machine would still activate. But that depends on the rule. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But there are three objects. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when 0 was alone, the machine would be on if 0 is a blicket. But when 0 was first put on alone, the light stayed off. So that can't be. So 0 isn't a blicket under that rule. But then when 0 and 1 were on, the light turned on. So maybe 1 is a blicket. But then putting 1 alone later didn't activate it. Hmm.\n\nWait, after taking 0 and 1 off, when the user puts 1 back on the machine (alone), the light is off. So 1 alone doesn't activate it. Then adding 2 to 1 doesn't help. But adding 0 (so 0,1,2 on machine) turns it on. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. But in that case, when 0 and 1 are on, it's on. When 0,1,2 are on, it's on. When only 1 and 2, it's off. When only 0, it's off. So that fits. But then the rule would be that both 0 and 1 are blickets and both need to be present. So 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires all blickets to be on. Then, when both are on, it turns on regardless of others. But in the second test case, putting 0,1,2 on the machine activates it. So that fits. But when the user took 0 off, leaving 1 on, the machine turned off, which would align with 0 being a necessary part. But then, when only 1 is on, it's off. So both must be present. So in that case, both 0 and 1 are blickets. Then why, in the last step, when 1 and 2 are on, adding 0 makes the machine turn on. Because now both 0 and 1 are present. So that fits. So in this scenario, objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires all blickets (both 0 and 1) to be present. Then object 2 is not a blicket. So the answer would be that object 0 is a blicket (True).\n\nBut wait, in the first test, putting 0 and 1 on the machine made it turn on. Then taking 0 off made it turn off. Then putting 1 back on alone didn't turn it on. Then adding 2, then adding 0 again turned it on. So the presence of 0 and 1 together is required. So yes, 0 is a blicket. Therefore, the answer should be True."}

Then they added object 1, and the machine turned on. So with both 0 and 1 on the machine, the light came on. But when they took off object 0, leaving only 1 on the machine, the light turned off. Then they tried putting object 1 back on alone, but the machine stayed off. Adding object 2 didn't help either. Finally, when they put object 0 back on with object 1 and 2, the machine turned on again. Wait, no, in the last step, after taking off 1 and 0, they put 1 back on, then 2, which didn't turn it on. Then adding 0 made it turn on again. So when 0 and 1 are both on, the machine activates. But when only 1 is on, it doesn't. Similarly, 1 and 2 together didn't work. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine. Or maybe the rule is that at least one of them is a blicket. Wait, but when only 1 was on, the machine didn't turn on. When 0 and 1 were on, it did. When 0 and 1 and 2 were on, it turned on. But when 0 was removed, even with 1 and 2, it turned off. Wait, no. Let me retrace the steps:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put object 1 on machine (now 0 and 1 are on): light turns on.\n3. Take off 0: light off (only 1 left on).\n4. Take off 1: all off.\n5. Put 1 back on: light remains off.\n6. Put 2 on: now 1 and 2 are on. Light still off.\n7. Put 0 on: now 0,1,2 on. Light turns on.\n\nSo, when 0 is added to 1 and 2, it turns on. But maybe the presence of 0 is required. Let's see the combinations:\n\n- Only 0: light off.\n- Only 1: light off.\n- Only 2: light off.\n- 0 and 1: light on.\n- 1 and 2: light off.\n- 0, 1, 2: light on.\n- 0 and 2: not tested. Hmm.\n\nBut from the steps, when 0 and 1 are on, light is on. When 0 is added to 1 and 2, it's on. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. Wait, no. Because when only 0 was on, the machine didn't activate. When 0 and 1 were on, it did. But that would suggest that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires at least one. Wait, no, because if 0 is a blicket and 1 isn't, then when both are on, the machine would activate because 0 is present. But in that case, when only 0 is on, it should activate. But in the first step, when only 0 was on, it didn't. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all objects on the machine must be blickets. But when 0 and 1 are on, the machine is on. If both are blickets, then when only 0 is on, it would require all (just 0) to be a blicket. But in that case, the machine should turn on. But when only 0 was on, it didn't. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present. Let's see. If 0 and 1 are blickets, putting both on would activate. If only one is on, it doesn't. When all three are on, but 0 and 1 are blickets, maybe the machine still activates (since two are present). But in the test, when all three were on, the machine turned on. So that's possible. But we need more data. Another possibility is that the machine activates if any blicket is present. But when only 0 was on, it didn't activate, which would mean 0 is not a blicket. But when 0 and 1 are on, it does activate. So maybe 1 is a blicket. But then why when only 1 is on, the machine doesn't activate. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, let me go through each action again:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off. So if 0 is a blicket, the machine should activate. But it didn't. So 0 is not a blicket. Or the rule is different.\n\n2. Then put 1 on machine (now 0 and 1 are on): light turns on. So combination of 0 and 1 makes it activate. So perhaps the rule is that both 0 and 1 need to be on. If both are blickets, then their combined presence activates the machine. But maybe the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But in that case, if 1 is a blicket, then putting 1 alone should activate it. But when they put 1 back on later (after taking off 0 and 1), the machine didn't activate. So that's confusing.\n\nWait, here's the sequence again:\n\n- After putting 0 and 1 on, machine turns on.\n\n- Take off 0: machine off (only 1 left). If 1 is a blicket, the machine should stay on. But it turns off. So that suggests that 1 alone isn't enough. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 are required to be on the machine. But then why would the machine activate when they are both on? Are they both blickets? Or is the rule that the sum of their \"blicktness\" is required to reach a threshold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine activates if at least two blickets are present. If 0 and 1 are both blickets, then putting them both on would activate. But then when all three are on (0,1,2), and 0 and 1 are blickets, machine stays on, which it does. However, when 1 is alone, it's only one blicket, so machine off. But in that case, when only 0 is on, machine off (so 0 is not a blicket), but when 0 and 1 are on, machine on (so 1 is a blicket). Wait, but if 0 is not a blicket, then 1 is the only blicket. So the machine would activate if there's at least one blicket, but in that case, when 1 is alone, the machine should be on. But in the game, when only 1 is on, the machine is off. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let's think of alternative rules. Maybe the machine activates if the number of blickets is odd. But in that case, if 1 is a blicket (alone), it would activate. But it didn't. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires exactly one blicket. Then, when 1 is on alone, it would activate. But in the game, it didn't. So that's not.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates if a specific combination is present. For example, 0 and 1 together, regardless of their blicket status. But that seems unlikely, since the problem states that blicktness is what matters.\n\nWait, the problem says that the machine's activation depends on the blickets' blicktness. So the rule must involve which objects are blickets. So we need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n\n- Putting 0 alone: no activation.\n\n- Putting 0 and 1: activation.\n\n- Taking 0 off (only 1): deactivation.\n\n- Putting 1 and 2: no activation.\n\n- Putting 0,1,2: activation.\n\nSo when 0 is present along with 1, the machine activates. But when 0 is not present (like when 1 and 2 are on), it doesn't. Also, when 0 is added back (with 1 and 2), it activates. This suggests that the presence of 0 is crucial. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. So perhaps 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But that can't be because when 0 is alone, it didn't activate. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates if all objects on it are blickets. If that's the case, then when 0 and 1 are on, both must be blickets. Then, when 0 is removed, leaving 1, since 1 is a blicket, the machine should stay on. But in the game, it turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if exactly one blicket is present. But in that case, if 1 is a blicket, then putting it alone should activate. But it didn't.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Let's consider possible combinations and see which blicket assignments and rules fit.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the rule is \"machine activates if at least one blicket is present\".\n\n- If 1 is a blicket, then putting 1 alone should activate. But in the game, it didn't. So 1 can't be a blicket under this rule.\n\n- If 0 is a blicket, then putting 0 alone should activate. But it didn't. So 0 can't be a blicket.\n\n- If 2 is a blicket, putting it alone would activate. But when 1 and 2 were on, it didn't. Unless 2 is not a blicket.\n\nThis rule doesn't fit the observations.\n\nCase 2: Rule is \"machine activates if exactly two blickets are present\".\n\n- When 0 and 1 are on, machine activates. So both must be blickets. Then, when 0 is alone (one blicket), no activation. When 1 is alone (one blicket), no activation. When 0,1,2 are on (two blickets), activation. But if 2 is not a blicket, then adding it wouldn't affect. But when 1 and 2 are on (assuming 1 is a blicket, 2 is not), then only one blicket, so machine off. Then putting 0 (another blicket) on would make two, so machine on. This fits. So under this rule, 0 and 1 are blickets. Then, the answer to whether object 1 is a blicket would be True.\n\nBut wait, when the user put 0 and 1 on, machine on. Then when they added 2 (non-blicket), machine stayed on (since two blickets are present). But according to the rule, it should activate as long as exactly two are present. Wait, the rule could be \"exactly two\" or \"at least two\". If the rule is \"at least two\", then even with three blickets, it would activate. But in the case where 0 and 1 are blickets, and 2 is not, putting all three would still have two blickets, so machine on. That fits. But when 1 and 2 are on (1 is a blicket, 2 isn't), that's one blicket, so machine off. Which aligns with the observation.\n\nBut then, the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. So 0 and 1 are blickets, and 2 is not. Then, when both 0 and 1 are on, machine on. When all three are on, still two blickets, so on. This fits the observed behavior. Therefore, object 1 would be a blicket, so the answer is True.\n\nBut wait, another possible rule: the machine activates if any blicket is present, but only when paired with another object. Like, the presence of a blicket plus any other object. But that seems more complex. Let's see: if 1 is a blicket, then putting 1 and 0 (non-blicket) would activate. Putting 1 and 2 (non-blicket) would also activate. But in the game, when 1 and 2 were on, the machine didn't activate. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if all objects on it are blickets. Then, putting 0 and 1 on (both blickets) would activate. Putting 0 alone (a blicket) would require all on the machine (just 0) to be blickets, so it should activate. But in the game, putting 0 alone didn't. So this contradicts.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates if exactly one blicket is present. Then, putting 1 alone would activate (if 1 is a blicket), but in the game, it didn't. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if the sum of some property (like weight) of the blickets meets a threshold. But without knowing the values, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates only when a specific combination of objects is present, regardless of their blicket status. But the problem states that the machine's activation is based on the blickets, so the rule must depend on which objects are blickets.\n\nWait, let's consider that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. If 1 is a blicket, then putting it alone should activate. But in the game, it didn't. So that can't be.\n\nWait, another angle: When 0 and 1 are on the machine, it activates. When 0 is removed, it deactivates. When 1 is put back alone, it doesn't activate. Then adding 2 (with 1) doesn't activate. Then adding 0 (so 0,1,2) activates. So the key seems to be the presence of 0 and 1 together. If 0 and 1 are both blickets, and the rule is that both need to be present, then when they are both on, it activates. If either is missing, even if others are present, it doesn't. For example, 0 and 2: if 0 is a blicket and 2 isn't, then machine off. But we didn't test that. However, in the game, when 0,1,2 are on, machine is on. If the rule requires both 0 and 1 to be present, then even adding 2 (non-blicket) wouldn't affect. That fits. So the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on the machine (and both are blickets). Thus, object 1 is a blicket. Therefore, the answer is True."}

The user is asking if object 2 is a blicket based on the interactions in the game. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I understand what happened.\n\nFirst, the initial state: all objects (0,1,2) are on the floor. The machine is off. \n\nThen, the user tried putting object 0 on the machine, but initially, there was a typo (\"put 0 on machine\") which the system didn't recognize. Then they corrected it to \"put object 0 on machine\". After that, the machine's light remained off. Then they put object 1 on the machine, and the light turned on. So at that point, objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, and the light is on. Wait, no. Wait, let me check again:\n\nOriginal steps after the look commands:\n- put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off\n- put object 1 on machine \u2192 light turns on\nSo when object 0 was added, light remained off. Then adding object 1 caused the light to turn on. So maybe the presence of both 0 and 1 triggered it, or maybe just object 1. \n\nBut then they took object 0 off, and the light turned off. Then took object 1 off. Then put object 1 back on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then added object 2, light still off. Then added object 0 again, and the light turned on. \n\nSo when object 1 was alone on the machine, light was off. Then when object 0 was added, light came on. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine for it to activate. Alternatively, maybe object 0 is a blicket and object 1 is not, but that doesn't fit because when object 1 was alone, it didn't activate. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the steps:\n\nAfter putting object 0 on machine \u2192 light off. Then putting object 1 \u2192 light on. Then taking 0 off \u2192 light off. Then taking 1 off. Then putting 1 back on \u2192 light off. Then adding 2 \u2192 light still off. Then adding 0 \u2192 light on. \n\nSo when 0 and 1 are together, the machine turns on. When 1 is alone, nothing. When 0 is alone, nothing. Then when 0 is added back with 1 already on, it turns on. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and both need to be present. Object 2 was added once with 1, but that didn't turn it on. Then adding 0 made it turn on. So 2 is not a blicket. \n\nWait, when they put object 1 on the machine again (after taking both off), the light was off. Then adding 2 didn't help. Then adding 0 turned it on. So the combination of 0 and 1 activates the machine. So both 0 and 1 are blickets. Object 2 was on the machine with 1, but the light didn't turn on. So 2 is not a blicket. Therefore, the answer should be False."}
