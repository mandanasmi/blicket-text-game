Like perhaps the objects are referred to by different names. Wait, maybe the command should be \"put object 0 on machine\" instead of just \"0\"? Let me think. The available commands are \"put ... on ...\", so maybe the ... should be the object name. The initial look command mentions the objects as \"object 0\", so perhaps the correct command is \"put object 0 on machine\".\n\nAh, right! The user might have omitted the word \"object\" in the command. So instead of \"put 0 on machine\", it should be \"put object 0 on machine\".

So I'm trying to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule makes the machine turn on. The machine's light turned on when I put all three objects on it. But maybe the rule isn't just having all of them. Let me test different combinations to see.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 alone on the machine, the light stayed off. Same with object 1. Then object 2 alone also didn't turn it on. Then I added object 1, still off. But when I added object 2, the light came on. Wait, but I put all three on in sequence. Maybe the rule is that all three need to be on the machine together. But maybe it's a different combination. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Or maybe it's a specific combination. Let me try removing one object at a time to see. For example, if I take object 2 off, leaving 0 and 1 on, does the light stay on or turn off? If it turns off, that suggests that object 2 is a blicket. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when any blicket is placed, but only if there are no non-blickets. But that doesn't fit because when I put object 0 and 1 on, nothing happened. So maybe the rule is that all objects must be blickets. But since putting all three made the light turn on, that would imply all three are blickets. But maybe not. Let me test.\n\nWait, let's think. When I placed object 0, 1, and 2 on the machine, the light turned on. Now, if I remove one, say object 2, what happens? Let's try that. Take object 2 off. If the light turns off, then maybe object 2 is a blicket and the others aren't, and the rule is that at least one blicket is needed. But earlier, when I placed object 2 alone, the light didn't turn on. So that can't be. Wait, when I put object 2 on the machine alone, the light was off. But when all three are on, it's on. So perhaps the rule requires all three to be present. But maybe only one is a blicket, but the machine requires a certain number. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. Or some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on it. Let's test by removing one at a time. For example, if I take object 0 off, leaving 1 and 2 on. If the light stays on, then maybe 1 and 2 are blickets. If it turns off, then maybe 0 is a blicket and others aren't. But earlier when 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. So that suggests that 0 and 1 alone aren't enough. But when adding 2, it turned on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the rule requires at least one blicket. But 2 alone didn't turn it on. Hmm. That contradicts.\n\nWait, when I put object 2 on the machine after 0 and 1, the light turned on. So maybe the combination of all three is needed. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all objects on it are blickets. If that's the case, then all three would be blickets. But I need to verify. Let's try putting two objects. Suppose I take object 0 off, so only 1 and 2 are on. If the light stays on, then maybe 1 and 2 are blickets. If it turns off, then 0 is also required. But how can I check that? Let me try taking object 0 off now. The machine currently has all three objects. If I take 0 off, leaving 1 and 2, does the light stay on? If it does, then maybe 1 and 2 are blickets. If it turns off, then 0 is needed, implying it's also a blicket. But I need to test this.\n\nSo, next step: take object 0 off the machine. If the light stays on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If it turns off, then 0 is a blicket. Let's try that."}

Let's recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, all objects (0, 1, 2) were on the floor. The machine's light was off. Then, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then added object 1, still off. Then added object 2, and the light turned on. Then I took object 0 off, and the light remained on. \n\nSo, when all three objects were on the machine, the light came on. But when I removed object 0, leaving 1 and 2 on, the light stayed on. That suggests that maybe the presence of object 2 is key. But wait, because when I added 0, 1, then 2, the light turned on only after adding 2. So perhaps 2 is a blicket. But then why did the light stay on when I took 0 off? Because maybe the rule is that if at least one blicket is on the machine, it turns on. But when 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe 2 is a blicket. But then removing 0, which isn't a blicket, leaves 1 and 2. But the light stayed on. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were on, it was off. So that suggests that 1 isn't a blicket either. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are present. Or maybe it's a certain number. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on: light off.\n2. Add 1: light still off.\n3. Add 2: light on.\n4. Remove 0: light remains on.\n\nSo with objects 1 and 2 on the machine, light is on. But earlier, with 0 and 1 on, light was off. So that implies that object 2 is a blicket because when it was added, the light turned on. Then, even after removing 0 (non-blicket), the light stays on because 2 is still there. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But then, if 2 is the only blicket, putting 2 on alone should turn it on. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in the initial steps, after putting 0, then 1, then 2, the light turned on. Then when I took 0 off, leaving 1 and 2, the light stayed on. But when I had 0 and 1 on, the light was off. So 1 alone can't activate it. But when 2 is added, it activates. So 2 must be a blicket. But what about 1? Let's test. If I remove 1 now, leaving only 2 on the machine, does the light stay on? Because according to the current state, after removing 0, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, and the light is on. If I take off 1, leaving just 2, the light should stay on if the rule is at least one blicket. But maybe the rule is that all blickets must be present. Wait, but that would require knowing how many blickets there are. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific combination. Let me think of possible rules:\n\nPossible rules:\n- Machine turns on when all blickets are placed on it. If there are multiple blickets, they all need to be on.\n- Machine turns on when any blicket is on it.\n- Machine requires a certain number of blickets (e.g., at least two) or a specific combination.\n\nIn the current scenario, when objects 0,1,2 were all on, the light turned on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 and 2, and the light remains on. If 2 is the only blicket, then the rule is that having any blicket (2) on the machine activates it. Because when 2 was added, the light turned on, and removing non-blickets doesn't affect it. But wait, before adding 2, 0 and 1 were on and the light was off. So if 2 is a blicket, then putting 2 alone should activate it. Let me verify that.\n\nSo next step: take object 1 off the machine. If the light stays on with only object 2, then that confirms that 2 is a blicket and the rule is at least one. If the light turns off, then maybe the rule requires all blickets, which might include 1 and 2, but that doesn't fit the previous steps. Let's test that."}

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. So far, I've tried putting all three objects on the machine, and the light turned on. Then I removed object 0, and the light stayed on. But when I removed object 1, the light turned off. That suggests that when both object 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. Because after removing 0, it was still on, but taking off 1 made it go off. Wait, but when I took off 1, only object 2 was left. So if the machine turned off, that means object 2 alone isn't enough. But when all three were on, it was on. Then when I removed 0, leaving 1 and 2, it stayed on. Then removing 1 left only 2, and it turned off. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on it. But which ones?\n\nWait, let's recap the steps:\n\n1. Put 0, 1, 2 on machine: light on.\n2. Take off 0: light remains on (so 0 isn't necessary once others are there).\n3. Take off 1: light turns off. So with only 2 left, it's off.\n\nSo the light was on when 1 and 2 were on the machine. Then when 1 was removed, only 2 remained, and it turned off. That suggests that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. But wait, when all three were on, maybe 1 and 2 together made it work. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. But when removing 1, even though 2 was still there, it turned off. So maybe 1 and 2 are both required. So the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on the machine for it to activate. That would mean the machine turns on when all blickets are present. So if 1 and 2 are the blickets, then having both of them on the machine makes it work. Let me test this.\n\nIf I put 1 and 2 on the machine, does the light turn on? Let's check. Previously, when all three were on, it was on. Then removing 0 didn't change that. Then removing 1 turned it off. So when only 1 and 2 were on (after removing 0), the light was on. Then removing 1 made it off, leaving 2. So that suggests that 1 and 2 together are required. So the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Wait, but maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed, or that all blickets must be present. Let me think.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on it. If 1 and 2 are blickets, then putting them both on makes the machine work. If all three are on, maybe that's still two blickets (but 0 isn't a blicket). Wait, but in that case, when all three are on, the machine is on. But if 0 isn't a blicket, then the presence of 0 doesn't affect it. So the presence of both 1 and 2 (the blickets) makes it work, regardless of other objects. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, and any number of non-blickets. So in this case, the blickets are 1 and 2. Then, when both are on, regardless of others, the machine is on. If either is removed, it turns off.\n\nSo in the previous steps, when all three were on, machine on. Remove 0 (non-blicket), still on. Remove 1 (blicket), machine off. That fits. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. The blickets are 1 and 2. Let me confirm by testing putting 1 and 2 back on the machine.\n\nBut how to do that now. Currently, after the last command, the machine has object 2 on it. Because after taking off 1, the light is off. So object 2 is on the machine alone. If I put 1 back on, the light should turn on. Let's try that. The next command would be to put object 1 back on the machine. If the light turns on, that confirms that 1 and 2 are both needed. Alternatively, if I take off 2 and put 1 on alone, the light should stay off. Then put 2 back on, and the light turns on. So let's proceed.\n\nBut the user's step count is limited, so I need to test efficiently. Let me try to put 1 back on the machine. If the light turns on, then that would confirm that both 1 and 2 are required. So the command would be 'put object 1 on machine'. Then observe the light. If it turns on, then the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be present. Then, to check if 0 is a blicket, maybe put 0 on the machine again and see if it affects the light. But from earlier steps, putting 0 on didn't make the light turn on when alone. So maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Let me proceed."}

Let's go through the steps so far.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then adding object 1 also didn't turn it on. But when I added object 2, the light came on. That suggests that object 2 might be a blicket, but maybe there's a combination effect. Then, when I took object 0 off, the light stayed on. But when I took object 1 off, the light turned off. Then putting object 1 back on turned it on again. \n\nWait, so when objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. But when I had all three on, it was on, and removing 0 didn't change that. But when I removed 1, the light went off. So maybe the rule is that both 1 and 2 need to be on the machine at the same time. Because when they were both on, the light stayed on. Even when 0 was added and then removed, it didn't affect the light as long as 1 and 2 were there. \n\nBut let me check again. When I first put 0 on, nothing. Then 1, still nothing. Then 2, light on. So adding 2 made it turn on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. Then removing 1 made it turn off. So with 2 and 1 on, light is on. If I take 1 off and put it back on, the light comes on again. So perhaps both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that at least two blickets need to be on the machine. Or maybe both need to be present. Let's test that.\n\nWait, when only object 2 was on the machine (after taking 0 and 1 off), but the light was off. Because when I took 1 off, the light turned off, leaving only 2 on. So that suggests that object 2 alone isn't enough. Then when I put 1 back on, the light turned on again. So maybe both 1 and 2 must be on the machine. So the rule is that both object 1 and object 2 are blickets, and both need to be on the machine for it to activate. Object 0 is not a blicket. \n\nBut wait, when all three were on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. Then removing 1 turned it off, even though 2 was still on. So that supports the idea that 1 and 2 are both needed. So the rule could be that all blickets must be on the machine. If there are two blickets (1 and 2), then both need to be on. If there's only one, then it's not enough. So the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that all blickets must be placed on the machine for it to turn on. Let me see if that fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. But in that case, if 1 and 2 are blickets, putting both on would work. But if there's a third blicket, but in this case, there are only three objects. Wait, the initial setup has 3 objects: 0,1,2. Let me check the interactions again.\n\nInitial steps:\n\n- Put 0: light off.\n- Put 1: light off.\n- Put 2: light on. So with 0,1,2 on, light is on. Then take 0 off: light remains on. Then take 1 off: light off. So now only 2 is on. Then put 1 back: light on again. \n\nSo with 1 and 2 on (and 0 off), the light is on. If only 2 is on, light is off. If only 1 is on, light is off. So the combination of 1 and 2 activates the machine. That suggests that the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be on. Therefore, both are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are present. Since there are two blickets (1 and 2), both must be on. Object 0 is not a blicket. \n\nTo confirm, maybe I should test putting 1 and 2 on without 0. Wait, the current state is that 1 and 2 are on the machine (since after putting 1 back on, the light is on). Let's take 2 off and see if the light stays on. Wait, but the user can only take one action per step. Let me think. To test if both are required: take 2 off. If the light turns off, then yes. But I need to do that. Let me try that in the next step. \n\nBut according to the previous steps, when after taking 1 off (leaving 2 and 0 on machine?), wait no. Wait, initial steps: after putting 0,1,2 on machine, light on. Then take 0 off: light remains on. So objects 1 and 2 are on. Then take 1 off: light off, so now only 2 is on. Then put 1 back on: light on. So now 1 and 2 are on. So if I take 2 off now, leaving 1 on, the light should turn off. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step would be to take 2 off. Let's see what happens. But the user needs to output a command. However, the assistant has to decide the next command. But according to the current scenario, the assistant is to output the next command. So in the current state, after putting object 1 back on, the machine is on. Now, to check if removing object 2 would turn it off. So the next command would be 'take object 2 off machine'. If the light turns off, then that confirms that both 1 and 2 are needed. \n\nBut the user only has a limited number of steps. Since the user has already done several steps, but the current step count is not shown, but the user has 32 steps total. But since the user wants to exit early if possible, maybe the assistant can conclude based on the current information. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on, but in this case, that's not possible because when only 2 was on, the light was off. So the rule must require a combination. \n\nGiven the previous interactions, the most likely rule is that both object 1 and 2 are blickets, and the machine requires both to be on. Therefore, the answer would be that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be placed on the machine. \n\nBut to be thorough, the assistant might want to test taking 2 off now. The current state is that object 1 and 2 are on the machine (since putting 1 back on after taking it off turned the light on). So taking 2 off now would leave only 1 on, and if the light turns off, that confirms both are needed. \n\nSo the next command should be taking object 2 off the machine."}

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The goal is to find out which ones are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nFirst, when I put all three objects on the machine, the light turned on. Then, when I took object 0 off, the light stayed on. But when I took object 1 off, the light turned off. Then putting object 1 back made it turn on again. Then removing object 2 turned it off. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's recap the steps:\n\n1. Put 0,1,2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n2. Remove 0 \u2192 light stays on.\n3. Remove 1 \u2192 light off.\n4. Put 1 back \u2192 light on.\n5. Remove 2 \u2192 light off.\n\nSo, when all three are on, it's on. But after removing 0, the machine stayed on. That suggests that maybe 0 isn't necessary. But when I removed 1, the light went off, even though 2 was still on. Then putting 1 back made it turn on again. Wait, but in step 5, after putting 1 back on, then removing 2 caused the light to turn off. So maybe the machine requires both 1 and 2 to be present? Let's see:\n\n- When 1 and 2 are on, the machine is on (after removing 0, which didn't affect it).\n- When only 2 is on (after removing 1), the machine is off.\n- When 1 is added back (so 1 and 2 are on), machine on again.\n- Then removing 2 (leaving 1), machine turns off.\n\nSo that suggests that the machine requires both object 1 and 2 to be present. So 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Wait, but maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is on, but no, because when only 2 was on (after step 3, when 0 and 1 were removed), the machine was off. But when 1 and 2 are on, it's on. So maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the machine requires both to be on. But then why did it turn on when all three were on? Because 0 might not be a blicket, but adding it doesn't affect the rule if the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be present. So putting all three on would satisfy that. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 and 2, so machine stays on. Removing 1 (a blicket) leaves 2, which alone isn't enough, so machine off. Then putting 1 back (so 1 and 2 again) turns it on. Then removing 2 (another blicket) leaves only 1, which isn't enough, so machine off. So the rule might be that the machine turns on when all blickets are present. If the blickets are 1 and 2, then the machine requires both to be on. But when all three were on, including 0 (non-blicket), the machine was on, which fits because the required blickets (1 and 2) were present. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all blickets are on it, regardless of other objects. So the blickets must be 1 and 2. Let me check if there's any other possibility. Maybe the rule is that at least two blickets are needed. But in the initial test, putting all three on turned it on, but when only 1 and 2 are on, it's also on. Then taking off 1 leaves only 2 (if 2 is a blicket), but the machine turns off. So that suggests that both are required. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine is even. But in that case, with 1 and 2 being two, it would be even. But when only 2 is on (if it's a blicket), that's odd, so machine off. But when only 1 is on, same. But I need more data. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets must be on. But if 1 and 2 are the only blickets, then that's the case. But maybe another test would help. Let's see. What if I put 1 and 2 on, without 0. The machine should turn on. Then add 0, and it should stay on. Wait, in the initial steps, putting 0,1,2 on made the machine turn on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So 0 is not a blicket. So the rule is that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and both must be on the machine. So the answer would be blickets are 1 and 2, rule is machine turns on when all blickets are on it. But let me think again. When I put 0,1,2 on, the machine turns on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 and 2, machine stays on. Removing 1 (blicket) leaves 2, machine turns off. Adding 1 back (so 1 and 2) turns it on again. Then removing 2 (blicket) leaves 1, machine off. So yes, that seems to confirm that both 1 and 2 are required. So the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on the machine, and the blickets are 1 and 2. Therefore, the next step could be to test if putting only 1 and 2 on the machine (without 0) will turn it on. Let me check the previous steps. When the user put object 0 on, then 1, then 2, the machine turned on. Then when they removed 0, the light stayed on. Then removing 1 turned it off. Then adding 1 again turned it on (so 1 and 2 are on). Then removing 2 turned it off. So yes, putting 1 and 2 on the machine (without 0) does make it turn on. So that confirms that 1 and 2 are the blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. So the answer would be that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are placed on it."}

The rule is that the machine requires all blickets (in this case, 1 and 2) to be on it. So the blickets are 1 and 2, and the rule is that both must be placed on the machine for it to activate."}

So, the user is asking if object 0 is a blicket. From the interactions in the game, I need to look at when the machine's light turned on and off based on which objects were placed on it.\n\nFirst, when all three objects (0, 1, 2) were put on the machine, the light turned on. Then, when object 0 was taken off, the light stayed on. But when object 1 was taken off, the light turned off. That suggests that object 1 and 2 might be the ones that are necessary. \n\nThen, putting object 1 back on the machine made the light turn on again. Later, when object 2 was taken off, the light turned off, and putting it back on turned it on again. \n\nWait, let me recap the steps:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n2. Put object 1 on \u2192 still off.\n3. Put object 2 on \u2192 light on. So all three were on, but the light only came on when 2 was added. So maybe 2 is a blicket. Then, removing 0 didn't affect the light. Then removing 1 turned it off. Then adding 1 back turned it on. Then removing 2 turned it off again. \n\nSo when object 1 and 2 are both on the machine, the light is on. But when either is removed, it turns off. Object 0's presence or absence didn't affect the light once it was on. So the rule might be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present, but in this case, the light only turned on when 2 was added, and then when 1 was added again. Wait, let me look again:\n\nAfter putting 0, 1, then 2 on the machine, the light came on when 2 was added. Then taking off 0 didn't change it. Taking off 1 turned it off. Then putting 1 back turned it on. Taking off 2 turned it off. So the presence of 1 and 2 together is needed. So both 1 and 2 must be blickets. Because when they're both on, the machine is on. If either is removed, it's off. So the rule might be that the machine requires all blickets to be present (if there's more than one). Or maybe it's an AND rule where both need to be on. \n\nBut when initially, putting 0,1,2 on machine: the light turned on when 2 was added. Before that, 0 and 1 were on but the light was off. Adding 2 made it on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So 0 wasn't necessary. Then removing 1 turned it off. So when 1 and 2 are on, it's on. So 1 and 2 are blickets. Object 0's presence didn't contribute. So object 0 is not a blicket. Therefore, the answer should be False."}

Because when all three were on, the light was on. Removing 0 didn't affect it. Removing 1 turned it off, but adding 1 back (with 2 still there?) Wait, when they took object 1 off after removing 0, the light turned off. Then putting 1 back on turned it on again. So with object 1 and 2 on the machine, the light is on. But when only object 2 was on the machine (after removing 1), the light was off. Then adding 1 back made it on. Then removing 2 (leaving only 1) turned it off again. So the combination of 1 and 2 is required. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are blickets. Object 0 doesn't seem to play a role because when it was removed, the light stayed on. So the rule is that both 1 and 2 must be present. Therefore, object 1 is a blicket."}

So from the commands and their outcomes, here's what happened:\n\nFirst, when all three objects (0, 1, 2) were placed on the machine, the light turned on. Then, taking off object 0 didn't turn it off, but taking off object 1 did. Then putting object 1 back on turned it on again. Then taking off object 2 turned it off, and putting object 2 back on turned it on again. \n\nWait, when they first put all three on, the light turned on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it (light stayed on). Removing 1 turned it off. Then putting 1 back on made it turn on again. Then removing 2 turned it off, and putting 2 back turned it on. \n\nHmm. So when object 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. But when only 2 is on, like after taking off 1, the light was off. Wait, no. Let me retrace:\n\nAfter putting all three (0,1,2) on the machine, the light is on. Then take 0 off: light stays on. Then take 1 off: light turns off. So with only 2 on, light is off. Then putting 1 back on (so 1 and 2 are on) turns light on. Then take 2 off (only 1 on) light turns off. Then put 2 back on (now 1 and 2 are on again) light turns on. \n\nWait, no. Let me check step by step:\n\n1. Put 0, 1, 2 on machine. Light turns on. So with all three, it's on.\n\n2. Take 0 off: light stays on. So the presence of 0 isn't necessary. So 0 is not a blicket, maybe.\n\n3. Take 1 off: light turns off. So when only 2 is on the machine, the light is off. But when 1 is back on (with 2), light is on again. Then take 2 off: light off. Then put 2 back on (with 1 still on?), light on. Wait, no. Wait, when after putting 1 on, the light is on (so 1 and 2 are on). Then taking 2 off (so only 1 is on) makes the light turn off. Then putting 2 back on (so 1 and 2) turns it on again.\n\nSo the light is on only when both 1 and 2 are on the machine. That suggests that the rule is that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the machine requires all blickets to be present. So the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on it. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, then whenever both are on, the machine is on. If either is missing, it's off. \n\nBut wait, when all three (0,1,2) were on, the light was on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So 0 isn't needed. Therefore, 0 is not a blicket. So the blickets must be 1 and 2. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket. \n\nSo the answer should be True."}
