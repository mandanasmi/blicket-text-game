Let me recap what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, all three objects (0, 1, 2) were on the floor. The machine was off. I tried putting each one on the machine one by one. When I put object 0 on, nothing happened. Then object 1, still nothing. But when I added object 2, the machine turned on. Hmm. That suggests that maybe all three need to be on the machine for it to activate. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when I added each one individually, the machine didn't turn on until all three were there. So maybe the rule is that all objects must be on the machine for it to work? But wait, maybe the third object is the key. Let me think.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 on, the machine stayed off. Then object 1 added, still off. Then adding object 2 made it turn on. So the machine only turned on when all three were placed. But maybe it's not about the number. Maybe object 2 is a blicket, but the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket. Wait, but when I put object 0 and 1 on, machine was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the others are not. But then why didn't it turn on when only 2 was placed? Wait, no. Because when I added 0, 1, then 2, each step added to the machine. So when 2 was added, that's when the machine activated. So perhaps the machine requires at least one blicket to be present, but in this case, maybe object 2 is the only blicket. But when I added 2 to the machine alone, would that have turned it on? Wait, I didn't test that. Because in the steps taken, the user put 0, then 1, then 2, each time adding to the machine. So after putting 0 and 1, the machine was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. But maybe if only 2 is on the machine, would that activate it? Because the previous steps added each object incrementally, but the machine only turned on when 2 was added. So maybe the presence of 2 is necessary, but perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when 2 is present. However, the user didn't test putting 2 alone. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires all objects on it to be blickets, and 2 is the only blicket. Wait, but when they added 0 and 1 (non-blickets) and then 2 (blicket), the machine turned on. So if the rule is that the presence of any blicket makes it turn on, then even if non-blickets are present, it should still activate. But in that case, when they added 0 and 1 (non-blickets), the machine stayed off, then adding 2 (blicket) made it turn on. That would align with the rule being that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. So in that case, 2 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not. But then why didn't the machine turn on when 2 was added? Wait, in the steps taken, the user added 0, then 1, then 2. So when 2 was added, the machine had all three objects on it. But if 2 is the only blicket, then the machine should have turned on when 2 was added, regardless of the others. But according to the output, after putting 2 on, the light turned on. So perhaps that's correct. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all objects on it are blickets. So if 0 and 1 are non-blickets, and 2 is a blicket, then having all three on the machine would have non-blickets and a blicket. But the machine turned on. So that contradicts that rule. Therefore, the rule must be different. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. But in this case, perhaps objects 1 and 2 are blickets. Wait, but when 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was off. Adding 2 turned it on. So if 1 is a blicket, then adding 1 would have made the machine turn on if the rule was at least one. Therefore, that suggests 1 is not a blicket. So maybe 2 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket. But when 2 was added, there were also 0 and 1 on the machine. So the presence of 2 would activate the machine. That fits. So in that case, the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it, and 2 is the blicket. But wait, the user didn't test putting only 2 on the machine. So maybe I need to test that. Let's see. The current state is that all three objects are on the machine. The light is on. So perhaps the next step is to remove 0 and 1 and see if the machine stays on. If I take 0 off, and 1 and 2 are still on, and the light stays on, then that would confirm that 2 is a blicket. Alternatively, if taking 0 and 1 off leaves only 2, and the light remains on, then yes. But if after removing 0 and 1, the light turns off, then maybe the rule is different. So the user's next steps should be to test individual objects. So first, maybe take object 0 off. Let's see. The user has 32 steps, so they can experiment more. So perhaps:\n\nTake object 0 off the machine. If the light stays on, then 0 is not a blicket. Then take object 1 off. If the light remains on, then 1 is not a blicket. Then take 2 off, and the light should turn off. Alternatively, if after removing 0, the light stays on, then 0 isn't needed. Similarly for 1. So the next steps would be to remove objects one by one and see when the light turns off. Let's try that. So first, take 0 off. Then check the light. Then take 1 off. Then check. Then take 2 off. \n\nBut in the current state, all three are on the machine. So the user's next action could be:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nThen check the status. If the light is still on, that means 0 isn't a blicket, and the remaining objects (1 and 2) are sufficient. Then take 1 off. If the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then maybe 1 is also a blicket. Alternatively, the rule could be that all blickets must be on the machine, but there are multiple. So perhaps the user needs to check different combinations. But since time is limited, they should proceed methodically.\n\nBut the user has already used three steps (putting 0, 1, 2). Now, let's proceed with the next steps.\n\nSo, after putting all three on and the machine turning on, the next step is to take some off to see which are required. Let's start with taking object 0 off. So:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nIf the light stays on, then object 0 isn't necessary. Then take object 1 off. If the light stays on, then object 2 is the only blicket. If it turns off, then perhaps both 1 and 2 are blickets. Then take 2 off, which would turn it off. \n\nAlternatively, if after removing 0, the light remains on, then 1 and 2 are on the machine. Then remove 1. If the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then 1 is also a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly three objects, but that's less likely. But the initial test showed that with all three, it turned on. But perhaps the rule is different. For example, maybe the sum of weights or something else. But given the setup, it's more likely related to the presence of specific objects (blickets).\n\nSo the next logical step is to remove objects one by one to see which are necessary for the machine to stay on. So the user should start with taking object 0 off. Let's simulate that. After taking 0 off, the machine has objects 1 and 2. If the light stays on, then object 0 isn't a blicket. Then take 1 off, leaving only 2. If the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If the light turns off when 1 is removed, then 1 and 2 are both blickets.\n\nAlternatively, if after removing 0, the light stays on, then the presence of 1 and 2 is enough. Then removing 1 would leave 2, and if the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. So in that case, the rule is that at least one blicket is present. So in the initial test, adding 2 made the total count of blickets reach 1, so the machine turned on. But that would mean that when 2 was added, even with 0 and 1, it turned on. So the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. Therefore, 2 is a blicket. But to confirm, we need to test if putting 2 alone on the machine turns it on. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So perhaps after removing 0 and 1, leaving only 2 on the machine, the light should stay on. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, current state: all three are on, light is on.\n\nAction 1: take 0 off. If light stays on, proceed. Then take 1 off. If light remains on, then 2 is the blicket. Then take 2 off, light turns off. Then put 2 back on, light turns on. That would confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, if after removing 0 and 1, the light turns off when only 2 is on, that would suggest that the rule requires more than one blicket. So the user needs to test this.\n\nBut given the initial observation, putting all three on made the light turn on. Then removing two to see if 2 alone works. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo, the next command would be to take object 0 off the machine."}

So, there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine turns on when certain combinations of them are placed on it.\n\nFirst, when I put all three objects on the machine, the light turned on. But when I took object 0 off, the light turned off. That suggests that maybe all three are needed, but maybe not. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. Initially, all objects were on the floor. Then I put object 0 on the machine: light stayed off. Then added object 1: still off. Then added object 2: light turned on. So with all three on, it's on. Then when I removed object 0, leaving 1 and 2, the light went off. So maybe all three are required? But that seems a bit strict. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of their weights or some other property requires all three. Or perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nWait, what if the machine requires exactly two specific objects? Like, maybe 1 and 2 are blickets. Let's see: when I had 0,1,2 on, the machine was on. Then taking off 0 left 1 and 2, but the light went off. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because if 1 and 2 were the blickets, then having them both on should activate the machine. But in that case, when I had 0,1,2 on, the machine was on, but removing 0 (non-blicket) should leave 1 and 2 on, which should keep the machine on. But in the previous step, after taking 0 off, the light went off. So that contradicts the idea that 1 and 2 are both blickets.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But when I put 0 and 1 on, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe 2 is a blicket. But when I took 0 off (leaving 1 and 2), the light went off. That would mean that 2 alone isn't enough. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires both 2 and another one. Wait, but when 0,1,2 were on, it was on. Then removing 0 made it off. So maybe the rule is that all objects on the machine must be blickets. So if 2 is a blicket, but 0 and 1 are not, then when all three are on, the machine is on only if all are blickets. But that doesn't fit because 0 and 1 aren't, so the machine shouldn't have turned on. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. But that's just speculation. Let's think of the experiments done so far:\n\n- 0 on: off\n- 0 and 1: off\n- 0,1,2: on\n- Remove 0 (leaves 1 and 2): off\n\nSo with all three, it's on. With 1 and 2, it's off. So perhaps the rule is that all three must be on. But then, when all three are on, it's on. But why would the machine require all three to be on? That's possible, but maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine must be exactly two. Let's see:\n\nIf 0 is not a blicket, 1 is not, 2 is. Then putting 2 on would turn it on. But when only 2 was added last, the machine turned on. Wait, no. The steps were: put 0, then 1, then 2. After each step, the light status was checked. After putting 0: off. Then 1: off. Then 2: on. So when adding 2 to 0 and 1, the light turned on. That suggests that 2 is a blicket, and the presence of 2 along with others is needed. But when 2 is on with 1 (after removing 0), the light is off. So maybe the rule is that 2 and another specific object must be present. For example, 0 and 2 together. Let's test that.\n\nWait, when I had 0,1,2 on, the light was on. Then taking off 0 left 1 and 2, and the light turned off. So if the rule was that 0 and 2 must be present, then removing 0 would break it, which matches. But when I had 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2 (so 0,1,2) turned it on. So if 0 and 2 together are required, then with 0 and 2 on, the machine should be on. But in that case, when 0 and 2 are on (plus 1), it's on. But if 1 is not a blicket, then maybe the presence of 1 doesn't affect. Wait, maybe the rule is that at least two blickets are on the machine. If 0 and 2 are blickets, then when both are on (with or without others), the machine turns on. Let's check:\n\n- When 0 was on alone: off (so 0 isn't a blicket)\n- Then 0 and 1: off (so 1 isn't a blicket)\n- Then adding 2 (all three): on. So if 2 is a blicket, then with 0 (non), 1 (non), and 2 (blicket), the machine is on. But that would require that the presence of a single blicket is enough, which contradicts the previous steps. Because when only 2 was on, the machine would be on. But when I put 0 and 1 and 2 on, the machine turned on. But when I took 0 off, leaving 1 and 2, it turned off. So if 2 is a blicket, why does removing 0 (non-blicket) cause the machine to turn off? That doesn't make sense. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is odd. Let's see:\n\nIf 2 is a blicket, and others aren't. Then:\n\n- 0: 0 blickets (even) \u2192 off\n- 0+1: 0 \u2192 off\n- 0+1+2: 1 (odd) \u2192 on\n- Remove 0: 1 and 2 \u2192 1 (odd) \u2192 should stay on, but in the previous step, the light turned off. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket is present. But again, same issue.\n\nAnother possibility is that the machine requires all blickets to be on it, but there's only one blicket (object 2). So when 2 is on, regardless of others, the machine is on. But when 2 is on with others, it's on. But when 2 is on alone, it's on. Wait, but in the steps, after putting 0,1,2 on, the light is on. Then taking 0 off leaves 1 and 2. If 2 is the only blicket, then the machine should stay on. But according to the previous step, the light turned off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's try to think of possible rules again.\n\nWhen all three are on: on. With 1 and 2: off. So the presence of all three is necessary. But that would mean that all three are blickets. But when they're all on, the machine is on. But then, if any one is removed, the machine turns off. But when I took 0 off, the light went off. So if all three are blickets, the rule might be that all must be present. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. If two of the three are blickets, then when all three are on, the machine is on. But when one is removed (say 0, which is a blicket), leaving 1 and 2, if only one of them is a blicket, then the machine would turn off. But this requires that two of the three are blickets. Let's test that.\n\nSuppose objects 0 and 2 are blickets. Then:\n\n- 0 on: one blicket \u2192 machine off (if rule is at least two)\n- 0+1: still one \u2192 off\n- 0+1+2: two blickets (0 and 2) \u2192 on\n- Remove 0: left with 1 and 2 \u2192 only 2 is blicket \u2192 off. This matches the observed behavior. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present, and objects 0 and 2 are blickets. But then, when object 0 was alone on the machine, the light was off (correct, as only one blicket). But then, when you add 1 (non-blicket) and 2 (blicket), the total becomes two, so machine turns on. Then removing 0 (blicket) leaves one, so off. That fits. So in this case, 0 and 2 are blickets. But wait, when I first put 0 on, it's off. Then adding 1 (non), still off. Then adding 2 (blicket), total two blickets \u2192 on. Then removing 0 (blicket), leaving 1 and 2 (only 2 is blicket), so machine turns off. That works. So the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. And the blickets are 0 and 2. But how do I confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. Then, in the case of 0,1,2 on, if two are blickets, then it's on. But when you remove one (0), leaving 1 and 2, if only one is a blicket, then it's off. That also fits. So possible blickets are 0 and 2, or 1 and 2, or 0 and 1. But how to determine which pair.\n\nWait, in the initial steps, when I put 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off. So if the rule is exactly two, then having 0 and 1 on would require both to be blickets. But since the light was off, that would mean that at least one of them isn't a blicket. So if the blickets are 0 and 2, then putting 0 and 1 on would only have one blicket (0), so machine stays off. Then adding 2 makes two (0 and 2), so machine turns on. Then removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 (only 2 is blicket), so machine off. That fits. Alternatively, if the blickets are 1 and 2, then putting 0 and 1 on would have 1 as blicket (only one), so machine off. Adding 2 gives two (1 and 2), machine on. Removing 0 leaves 1 and 2 (two blickets), so machine should stay on. But in the previous step, after removing 0, the machine turned off. So that contradicts. Therefore, the blickets can't be 1 and 2. Similarly, if the blickets were 0 and 1, then putting them both on would turn the machine on, but in the step where 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. So that's not possible. So the only possible pair is 0 and 2.\n\nBut wait, if the rule is exactly two, then when all three are on (0,1,2), and if 0 and 2 are blickets, then exactly two are present, so machine on. If the rule is at least two, then same result. But in either case, the pair is 0 and 2. But how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. Suppose there are two blickets (0 and 2). Then when both are on, machine on. If any other object is added, it doesn't matter. So:\n\n- 0 and 2 on: machine on\n- 0,1,2 on: machine on\n- 2 on alone: machine off (needs both 0 and 2)\n- 0 on alone: machine off\n- 1 and 2 on: machine off (missing 0)\n\nBut in the steps:\n\n- Putting 0, then 1, then 2: after adding 2, machine on (0 and 2 are on). Then taking 0 off leaves 1 and 2: machine off. Which fits the rule that both 0 and 2 must be present.\n\nSo the rule could be that both 0 and 2 are blickets and both must be on the machine. So the machine turns on only when both 0 and 2 are present, regardless of others. So even if 1 is also on, as long as 0 and 2 are there, it's on. But when either 0 or 2 is removed, it turns off.\n\nTo test this, I could try putting 0 and 2 on the machine without 1. Let's see: currently, after taking 0 off, the machine is off. So 1 and 2 are on. Let's take 1 off, then put 0 and 2 on.\n\nBut I need to think of the next step. Right now, the machine has 1 and 2 on it, and the light is off. So I need to take some actions to test. Let's try removing 1 and 2, then putting 0 and 2 back on.\n\nBut the user has a limited number of steps, so need to be efficient.\n\nCurrent state after last step:\n\nObjects on machine: 1 and 2 (light off)\nObjects on floor: 0\n\nSo to test if 0 and 2 together turn it on, I can take 1 off, then add 0.\n\nSo:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nThen:\n\nMachine has 2. Then put 0 on machine. If light turns on, that would confirm that 0 and 2 are needed.\n\nAlternatively, after taking 1 off, machine has 2. Adding 0 would make 0 and 2. If the light turns on, then the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo next command: take object 1 off machine. Then put object 0 on machine. If light turns on, then the rule is that both 0 and 2 are required.\n\nBut I need to output the next command. Since the user can only do one command at a time.\n\nBut the current state is:\n\nMachine has objects 1 and 2 (light off). Floor has 0.\n\nThe user's previous steps were:\n\nput 0,1,2 \u2192 light on. Then take 0 \u2192 light off.\n\nSo now, the user could try taking 1 off, leaving 2 on. Then put 0 on.\n\nSo the next commands would be:\n\ntake object 1 off machine \u2192 machine has 2. Light remains off? Then put 0 on \u2192 machine has 0 and 2. If light turns on, then the rule is that 0 and 2 must both be present.\n\nSo let's simulate that.\n\nAfter taking 1 off, machine has 2. Light is off. Then putting 0 on: machine has 0 and 2. If light turns on, then that confirms that 0 and 2 are blickets and both needed.\n\nBut in the previous test, when all three were on (0,1,2), the light was on. Then taking 0 off left 1 and 2, light off. Then taking 1 off leaves 2. Then putting 0 on would make 0 and 2. If the light turns on, that supports the hypothesis.\n\nSo next action: take object 1 off machine.\n\nBut the user can only do one command per step. So the next step is to take object 1 off the machine."}

So, the machine turns on when certain objects called blickets are placed on it. The challenge is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine activate.\n\nFrom the previous steps, when all three objects (0, 1, 2) were on the machine, the light turned on. Then, when I removed object 0, the light stayed off even though 1 and 2 were still on. Then removing 1 also left only object 2, but the light was still off. Wait, no, after putting all three on, the light was on. Then when I took off 0, the light went off. Then taking off 1, leaving only 2, the light remained off. But originally, when all three were on, the light was on. Hmm.\n\nWait, the sequence was:\n\n- Put 0 on: light off.\n- Put 1 on: light still off.\n- Put 2 on: light turns on.\nSo when all three are on, it's on. Then removing 0, the light goes off. That suggests that all three are required? But then taking 0 off, leaving 1 and 2, the light is off. So maybe the rule is that all three must be on. But that seems unlikely because there are only three objects. But maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. Or maybe it's a different combination.\n\nWait, when I put 0, then 1, then 2, the light came on. So adding 2 caused it to turn on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. But maybe object 2 is a blicket, and the rule requires at least one blicket. Wait, no. Because when only 2 was on the machine (after removing 0 and 1), the light was off. Wait, let me check the steps again.\n\nAfter putting all three on, the light is on. Then take 0 off: light off. So now only 1 and 2 are on. Then take 1 off: light off. So only 2 remains, light off. So when all three are on, it's on. If I remove any one, it turns off. So maybe the rule is that all three must be on. But that would mean all three are blickets. But maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly three objects are on it. Wait, but maybe the number of objects isn't the rule. Because in the initial state, the user added all three and it turned on. Then removing any one caused it to turn off. So perhaps the machine requires all three to be on. But that would mean that all three are blickets. But that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the presence of object 2 plus another. Let's see.\n\nWait, when 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was off. Adding 2 turned it on. So perhaps 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. But then, when 2 was left alone, after removing 0 and 1, the light was off. So that contradicts that. Unless the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. Hmm. Wait, let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present, or some other condition. Let's consider possible rules. Common rules in such problems are:\n\n- The machine activates if at least one blicket is present (but that doesn't fit because when 2 was on alone, the light was off)\n- The machine activates if all blickets are present (so if there are multiple blickets, all must be on)\n- The machine activates if exactly two blickets are present.\n- The machine uses a logical AND (all blickets must be on) or OR (any blicket on).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the number of blickets. Let's see.\n\nIn the initial test:\n\nPut 0, 1, 2 all on: light on. Then removing any one (0) turns it off. Then removing 1 leaves 2, which is off. So when all three are on, it's on. If any one is removed, it's off. So this suggests that all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present. Because if any one is missing, the machine turns off. But that would mean all three are blickets. But let's check.\n\nWait, when all three are on, the machine is on. If all three are blickets and the rule is that all must be on, then that's why. But when the user took off 0, leaving 1 and 2, the machine turned off. So if the rule is that all blickets must be on, then all three are blickets. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on when exactly two blickets are present, and all three are blickets, but that doesn't fit. Because with all three on, that would be three blickets, which would not meet the 'exactly two' condition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is activated by an even number of blickets. If there are two blickets, then when all three are on, maybe two are blickets, and three is odd. Wait, but in that case, when all three are on, the count is two (if one is not a blicket), which is even. But when you take off one, the count becomes one, which is odd. But that doesn't fit because when the user took off 0, leaving 1 and 2, the light was off. If two blickets (1 and 2), then the count is two (even), which would activate the machine. But in that case, the light should stay on. But according to the previous steps, when 0 was removed, the light went off. So that suggests that the count isn't even. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine is activated by the presence of at least two blickets. So when all three are on, perhaps two of them are blickets. Then when one is removed, maybe only one remains, so the machine turns off. But in that case, when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2, if both are blickets, the machine should stay on. But according to the steps, when 0 was removed, the light turned off. So that contradicts that.\n\nWait, maybe object 2 is the only blicket, and the machine requires that it's on. But when the user put 2 on the machine (after 0 and 1), the light turned on. Then, when 0 and 1 were removed, leaving only 2, the light was off. Wait, that's impossible. Because if 2 is the only blicket, then when it's on the machine alone, the light should be on. But according to the steps, after putting all three on, then taking 0 and 1 off, leaving 2 on, the light was off. So that can't be.\n\nWait, let me retrace the steps again. The user's actions:\n\n1. Put 0 on: light off.\n2. Put 1 on: light off.\n3. Put 2 on: light turns on.\n4. Take 0 off: light off.\n5. Take 1 off: light off.\n\nSo after step 3, all three are on, light is on. Then when 0 is taken off (leaving 1 and 2), the light goes off. Then when 1 is taken off (leaving 2), light stays off.\n\nSo the machine was on only when all three were present. So the rule could be that all three must be on the machine. But that would mean the rule isn't about blickets but the number of objects. But the problem states that blickets are the ones that make the machine turn on, so the presence of blickets must be the key. So perhaps all three objects are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be present. Therefore, when all three are on, it's on. If any are missing, it's off. That would fit. But the problem says \"some\" of the objects are blickets. If all are blickets, then \"some\" is technically correct (since some can mean at least one, but maybe the problem implies a subset). Wait, the problem says \"Some of these objects are blickets.\" So it's possible that all are, but maybe not. Let's think.\n\nIf all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be on, then the observations fit. But if only two are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. Let's say 1 and 2 are blickets. Then, when all three are on, the machine is on (since both blickets are present). But when 0 is removed (leaving 1 and 2), the machine should stay on. But according to the steps, the light turns off. So that's a problem. So that scenario doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the rule is that the presence of any blicket, but in that case, when 2 is added (assuming 2 is a blicket), the light would turn on when 2 is added. But in the steps, adding 2 made the light turn on. But then removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, the light should stay on, but in the steps it was off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, when the user added 0, then 1, then 2. After adding 0 and 1, the light was off. Adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe 2 is a blicket. Then, when 2 is on the machine, the light should be on, regardless of others. But when 0 and 1 are removed, leaving 2, the light was off. So that's conflicting. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. Let's say objects 0 and 1 are blickets. Then, when all three are on (0,1,2), but 2 is not a blicket. So two blickets are present (0 and 1), so the machine is on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2), only one blicket (1) remains. So machine turns off. Then removing 1, leaving 2 (non-blicket), light remains off. That fits. But then, when the user added 0 and 1 first, the machine should have turned on when the second blicket (1) was added. But according to the steps, when 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) made the light turn on. But in this scenario, adding a non-blicket wouldn't change the count. So that doesn't fit. So this scenario is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe objects 0 and 2 are blickets. So when 0 and 1 are on (only 0 is a blicket), light off. Adding 2 (another blicket) makes two blickets, so light turns on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2), which has one blicket (2), so light turns off. Then removing 1 leaves 2 (blicket), so light turns on. But in the steps, after removing 0 and 1, leaving only 2, the light was off. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's consider another approach. Let's try to test if object 2 is a blicket. When only 2 is on the machine, does the light turn on? Let's check. The user hasn't tried that yet. So maybe the next step is to put object 2 back on the machine alone and see.\n\nBut wait, after the user took off 0 and 1, leaving 2 on the machine, but the light was off. So that suggests that when 2 is alone, the machine is off. So if 2 is a blicket, then the rule can't be that having any blicket on activates the machine. So perhaps the rule is that having all blickets on the machine. So if there are two blickets, both need to be on. Let's say 2 and another object are blickets. For example, 1 and 2.\n\nScenario: 1 and 2 are blickets, rule is both must be on. So when 0,1,2 are on, both blickets are present, so machine on. Remove 0: still 1 and 2, so machine stays on. But in the user's steps, removing 0 caused the machine to turn off. So that's a problem. So that scenario doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if 0 and 2 are blickets. Then, when all three are on, both blickets are present. If the rule is both must be on, then removing 0 would leave 2 (only one blicket), machine turns off. That matches the user's observation. Then removing 1 (leaving only 2) still machine off. But then, putting 0 and 2 on would activate the machine. Let's see: if the user puts 0 and 2 on, the machine should turn on. Let's check if that's possible. The user hasn't tried that combination yet. So perhaps the next step is to test putting 0 and 2 on the machine to see if the machine turns on. If it does, then the rule might be that both 0 and 2 are blickets and both need to be present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is odd. For example, if there are three blickets (all objects), then when all three are on, which is an odd number (3), the machine is on. But when any are removed, making it even (2), the machine turns off. But when 0 is removed, leaving 1 and 2 (two blickets, assuming all are blickets), that's even, so machine off. Then removing 1 leaves 1 blicket (2), which is odd, so machine should turn on. But according to the steps, after removing 1, leaving 2, the machine was off. So that contradicts. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine is activated by the presence of exactly one blicket. But when 2 is added (assuming it's a blicket), the machine turns on. Then if only 2 is on, it should activate. But in the steps, after removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, the machine was off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Let's recap. The machine turned on only when all three objects were on. Removing any one caused it to turn off. This suggests that the rule requires all three to be present. But the problem states that some are blickets, not all. Unless the problem allows all to be blickets. The instructions say \"some of these objects are blickets\", which could mean at least one, so maybe all are possible. So if all three are blickets and the rule is that all must be on, then that fits. But perhaps there's another rule. For example, the machine activates when exactly two blickets are on, and all three are blickets, but that would mean when all three are on, the count is three, which doesn't meet exactly two. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of some property of the blickets is met. For example, each blicket has a weight, and the total weight must reach a threshold. But without knowing the weights, that's hard to test. But the user hasn't been given any information about weights, so probably not.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it activates when all the blickets are on the machine, and there's at least one. So if there are two blickets, and both are on, then it activates. But in the user's case, when all three are on, it's active. So perhaps all three are blickets. Because when any is removed, the machine turns off. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, and all three are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's rule is that it activates when all objects on it are blickets. So if all three are blickets, then putting them all on activates it. If any non-blicket is on, it doesn't. But in that case, if there's a non-blicket on the machine, even with blickets, it won't activate. Wait, but in this scenario, when all three are on and the machine is on, that would mean all are blickets. Then removing any one (a blicket) leaves two blickets and one non-blicket? No, because if all are blickets, then even after removing one, the remaining two are blickets, but the rule would require all objects on the machine to be blickets. If the machine has two blickets (since the other objects are on the floor), then the machine would activate. But according to the steps, after removing 0, leaving 1 and 2, the machine was off. So that's a contradiction. So that rule doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of possible experiments to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nThe user has already tested putting all three on, which activates the machine. Then removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, which doesn't activate. So the next step could be to test putting 2 back on alone. But wait, after removing 0 and 1, the user took them off, leaving 2 on the machine. The light was off. So with 2 alone, the machine is off. So if 2 is a blicket, the rule can't be \"any blicket present\". So perhaps 2 is not a blicket, but the combination of all three makes it work. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. Let's say objects 0 and 1 are blickets. Then:\n\n- Put 0 on: 1 blicket \u2192 machine off.\n- Put 1 on: 2 blickets \u2192 machine on.\nBut in the user's steps, putting 0 and 1 on resulted in the machine being off. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) made it on. So that contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 and 2 are blickets. Putting 0 and 1 on: 1 blicket \u2192 off. Add 2 (another blicket) \u2192 2 blickets \u2192 on. Then removing 0: 1 and 2 remain (two blickets) \u2192 machine stays on. But according to the user's steps, removing 0 caused the machine to turn off. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Let's try another angle. The user needs to figure out the minimal set of objects that activate the machine. When all three are on, it's active. Then, to find if a subset works. For example, try putting 0 and 2 on. If the machine turns on, then maybe 0 and 2 are blickets. But according to the previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. Adding 2 made it on. So perhaps 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is present. But when 2 was alone, it was off, so that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present, and the total number of blickets is even. For example, two blickets. Then, with all three objects on, if two are blickets, the count is two (even), so machine off. But in the user's case, it was on. So that's not possible.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's think again. The user has only performed a few steps. Let's outline the observations:\n\n1. Put 0 \u2192 off.\n2. Put 1 \u2192 off.\n3. Put 2 \u2192 on.\n4. Remove 0 \u2192 off (remaining 1 and 2).\n5. Remove 1 \u2192 off (remaining 2).\n\nSo, the machine is on only when all three are present. So the rule could be that all three must be on. But the problem says the rule is based on blickets. So maybe all three are blickets, and the rule is that all must be present. So if any blicket is missing, the machine turns off. So all three are blickets. But how to confirm that?\n\nThe user could try putting 0 and 2 on to see if that activates the machine. If the rule is that all three must be on, then putting two should leave it off. If the machine turns on with two, then the rule is different.\n\nSo the next step could be to test that combination. For example:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then maybe the rule is different. But according to the previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on (without 2), it was off. Adding 2 made it on. Then removing 0 made it off. So perhaps the presence of 2 is crucial.\n\nWait, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, the machine turned on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that 2 must be present along with at least one other blicket. For example, 2 is a blicket, and either 0 or 1 is also a blicket. Then:\n\n- If 0 is a blicket, putting 0 and 2 on should activate it.\n- If 1 is a blicket, putting 1 and 2 on should activate it.\n\nSo the user could test those combinations.\n\nBut in the current state, after step 5, all objects are on the floor. The machine is empty. So the user can now try putting combinations.\n\nFor example, put 2 on alone: if the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket and the rule is any blicket. But according to previous steps, when 2 was on alone after removing 0 and 1, the light was off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, put 2 and 1 on. If the light turns on, then maybe both are blickets. Let's say the rule is that 1 and 2 must be present.\n\nBut how to proceed. The user has limited steps, so they need to be efficient.\n\nCurrent possible conclusions:\n\n- The machine activates only when all three are present. Thus, all three are blickets, and the rule is all must be on.\n\nBut the problem says \"some\" objects are blickets, but it's possible that all three are.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when object 2 is on, but only if at least one other object is also on. So 2 is a blicket, and another object is a blicket, but the rule requires both.\n\nBut when 0,1,2 are on, the machine is on. If the rule is that 2 and another blicket must be present, then if 0 is a blicket, then putting 0 and 2 on should work. But according to previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on (without 2), the light was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So maybe 2 is a blicket and either 0 or 1 is also a blicket. So, when 2 is present with another blicket, the machine turns on.\n\nBut when the user removed 0, leaving 1 and 2, the light went off. So if 1 is not a blicket, but 0 is, then removing 0 (a blicket) leaves 1 (non) and 2 (blicket). So the rule requires both 2 and another blicket. So without 0, the machine turns off. Then putting 0 and 2 on would activate it.\n\nTo test this, the user could try putting 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule might require both 0 and 2. If it doesn't, then maybe the rule requires all three.\n\nSo the next command should be to put 0 and 2 on the machine. Let's see.\n\nCurrent state after step 5: all objects are on the floor. Machine is empty.\n\nSo the user can do:\n\nput object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nput object 2 on machine \u2192 light on? Or not.\n\nIf the light turns on with 0 and 2, then the rule could be that both 0 and 2 are blickets. If not, then the rule requires all three.\n\nAlternatively, the user could try putting 1 and 2 on.\n\nSo the next step is to try putting 0 and 2 on the machine and see if the light turns on.\n\nIf the light turns on, then the rule is that both 0 and 2 are blickets, and their presence activates the machine. If not, then the rule might require all three.\n\nSo the next command should be:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nThen, put object 2 on machine.\n\nBut let's simulate:\n\nFirst command: put 0 on \u2192 light off.\n\nSecond command: put 2 on \u2192 light on?\n\nIf that's the case, then the rule is that both 0 and 2 are blickets. But then, when all three are on, including 1 (non-blicket), the machine is on. But if the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present, then adding 1 (non-blicket) wouldn't affect it. But according to the previous steps, when 0,1,2 are on, the light is on. Then removing 0 makes it off. Which fits. Then putting 0 and 2 back on would turn it on again. So this scenario is possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the light doesn't turn on with 0 and 2, then maybe all three are needed.\n\nBut the user has limited steps, so they need to plan efficiently.\n\nAnother angle: when all three were on, the machine was on. So the minimal set is all three. But maybe the rule is that the machine activates when three objects are on, regardless of which ones. But the problem states that the rule is based on blickets. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present and all present objects are blickets. So if all objects on the machine are blickets, then it activates. In this case, when all three are on, they are all blickets \u2192 activate. If any non-blicket is added, it won't activate. But in this scenario, the user hasn't tested adding a non-blicket. But according to the steps, when 0 and 1 were on (assuming they are blickets), the machine was off. Then adding 2 (another blicket) made it on. But if all three are blickets, then when 0 and 1 are on, the machine should be on, because all on the machine are blickets. But according to the user's steps, that wasn't the case. So that's a contradiction.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to outline the possible hypotheses and test them.\n\nHypothesis 1: All three objects are blickets, and the rule is that all must be on the machine to activate it.\n\nThis fits the observations:\n\n- All three on \u2192 on.\n- Any one removed \u2192 off.\n\nBut the problem states \"some\" are blickets, which could include all.\n\nHypothesis 2: Object 2 is a blicket, and the rule requires that object 2 is present along with at least one other blicket. For example, object 0 is also a blicket.\n\nThen:\n\n- 0 and 2 on \u2192 on.\n- 1 and 2 on \u2192 on if 1 is a blicket.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on (without 2), the machine was off. Adding 2 made it on. So if 0 and 2 are blickets, then putting 0 and 2 should activate it. But when 0 and 1 are on, adding 2 (a blicket) would make two blickets (0 and 2), which would activate the machine. But according to the steps, when 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. Adding 2 made it on. So if the rule is that at least two blickets must be present, then 0 and 2 are blickets. But when 0 and 1 are on, only one blicket (0) is present. Adding 2 (another) makes two, which activates the machine.\n\nBut then, after removing 0 (leaving 1 and 2), the light turns off. Which would mean that only one blicket (2) is present, which is insufficient. So that fits. Then, if the user puts 0 and 2 on, the machine should activate. So testing this would confirm.\n\nAlternatively, if the user puts 1 and 2 on, and the machine activates, then 1 is also a blicket. But in the previous steps, putting 1 on alone didn't activate it.\n\nSo the next step should be to test putting 0 and 2 on the machine.\n\nThe user has to do this in steps. First, put 0 on, then 2.\n\nAfter step 5, all objects are on the floor. So:\n\n> put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n> put object 2 on machine \u2192 if light turns on, then the hypothesis is supported.\n\nSo the next command should be to put object 0 on the machine again."}

So there are three objects: 0, 1, and 2. The machine turns on when certain combinations are placed on it. \n\nFirst, I put all three objects on the machine, and the light turned on. Then, when I took off object 0 and 1, leaving only object 2, the light stayed on. Wait, no, after putting all three on, the light was on. Then when I took off 0, the light turned off. Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nThe user's actions were: put 0 on, machine off. Then put 1 on, still off. Then put 2 on, light turns on. So with all three, it's on. Then taking off 0 and 1 (so only 2 remains), the light is off. Then putting 0 back on, the light turns on again. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, after putting all three on (0,1,2), the machine is on. Then when taking off 0, the light goes off. Then taking off 1, light stays off. Then putting 0 back on, the light comes on again. So when 0 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. But when only 2 was on, it was off. Wait, let me retrace:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- Put 0 on: light off.\n\n- Put 1 on: light still off.\n\n- Put 2 on: light turns on. So all three are on, machine is on.\n\nThen take off 0: light turns off. So now 1 and 2 are on, machine off.\n\nTake off 1: now only 2 is on, machine off.\n\nPut 0 on: machine turns on again. So now 0 and 2 are on. So that combination turns the machine on.\n\nSo what's the rule here? It seems like when object 0 and 2 are both on the machine, it turns on. But when 0 was alone (initially) it didn't. When 1 and 2 were on, it didn't. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. But which ones?\n\nWait, when 0 and 2 are on, it's on. When 0,1,2 are on, it's on. But when 1 and 2 are on, it's off. So perhaps object 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both need to be present. Because when 0 and 2 are on, machine is on. But when only 2 is on, machine is off. So the rule might be that both 0 and 2 must be on the machine. But wait, when all three are on, the machine is on. Then when you take off 0 and 1, leaving 2, machine is off. Then putting 0 back (so 0 and 2 are on), machine is on. That suggests that 0 and 2 together activate the machine. But then why when all three are on, it's on? Because both 0 and 2 are present. So 1 might not be a blicket. So the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. Let's test this.\n\nWait, when you first put 0 on, machine is off. Then adding 1 (still off). Then adding 2 (on). So adding 2 to 0 and 1 turns it on. Then removing 0, leaving 1 and 2, machine turns off. Then removing 1, leaving 2: still off. Then putting 0 back (so 0 and 2 on), machine on. So that's consistent with 0 and 2 being required. But when all three are on, since 0 and 2 are present, it works. So the rule might be that the machine activates if at least two blickets are present. Wait, but in that case, when you have 0 and 2 (two blickets), it's on. If the rule is that at least one blicket is present, but when 0 was alone, it was off. So the rule must be that all blickets must be on the machine. Wait, but if 0 and 2 are the only blickets, and the rule is that both must be present, then in the initial step with all three, both 0 and 2 are present, so machine is on. Then when 0 is removed, only 2 is left (needs both), so off. Then when 0 is added back (0 and 2), machine on. So that's consistent. So the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. \n\nBut how do we confirm that? Let's see. What if I take 2 off and leave 0 on? If the rule is both 0 and 2 need to be on, then machine should be off. Let me check the existing steps. When only 0 was on, machine was off. Then adding 1 and 2, machine on. Then after removing 0 and 1, leaving 2: machine off. Then putting 0 back (so 0 and 2 on), machine on. So yes, that suggests that 0 and 2 are both required. So the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be on the machine. So the blickets are 0 and 2. Object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nSo now, to confirm, perhaps try putting 0 and 2 on without 1. Let's see. But in the current state, after putting 0 on (so machine is on with 0 and 2). Wait, no: after the last step, the user put 0 on the machine. At that point, the machine's state is: 0 is on, 2 is on? Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nAfter the user's commands:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n\n2. Put 1 on: light off.\n\n3. Put 2 on: light on. (All three on)\n\n4. Take 0 off: light off. Now 1 and 2 on.\n\n5. Take 1 off: light off. Now only 2 on.\n\n6. Put 0 on: light on. Now 0 and 2 on.\n\nSo yes, when 0 and 2 are on, the light is on. So the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be present. Therefore, the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. \n\nSo to confirm, maybe try taking 2 off and see if the light turns off. But the user hasn't done that yet. Let's see. If the user takes 2 off now (current state: 0 and 2 on, machine is on), taking 2 off would leave only 0 on. If the light turns off, that confirms that both are needed. But the user hasn't done that yet.\n\nSo the next step would be to test that. For example, take 2 off the machine. If the light goes off, then it confirms that both are needed. Alternatively, take 0 off, leaving 2 on, and see if the light goes off.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, when only 2 was on (after taking off 0 and 1), the light was off. Then putting 0 on (with 2 still on) made it turn on. So that suggests that when both 0 and 2 are on, it's on. Therefore, the rule is that both are required, and they are blickets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly two objects are needed, regardless of which ones. But that doesn't fit because when 1 and 2 were on, the machine was off. So no. So the rule is specific to certain objects. So the conclusion is that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the machine requires both to be on. So the next step could be to confirm by removing 2 and seeing if the light goes off. But since the user has a limited number of steps, maybe they can exit now if confident. But let's see. The user might want to make sure. For example, take object 2 off now and see if the light turns off. \n\nCurrent state: after the last command, putting 0 on the machine (so 0 and 2 are on, machine is on). If the user takes 2 off, the machine should turn off. Let's do that. \n\n> take object 2 off machine\n\nIf the light turns off, that confirms it. Then putting 2 back on would turn it on again. But since the user has limited steps, maybe they can exit now. But perhaps it's better to test. However, the user might have already done enough steps to conclude. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that at least one of the blickets is present, but the initial steps don't support that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present. But with 0 and 2 as blickets, putting two on would activate. But when all three are on (including 1, which is not a blicket), it's still two blickets (0 and 2), so machine is on. Then removing 0 leaves one blicket (2), so off. Then putting 0 back, two blickets again. So that fits. But that's the same as the rule requiring both 0 and 2. \n\nBut the key is that the machine is on when both 0 and 2 are present, regardless of other objects. So the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. \n\nSo the user can now exit and report that. But to be thorough, maybe test taking 2 off now. But given the step limit, perhaps it's better to exit. The user has already done six steps, and there's a 32-step limit. So they can proceed to exit. \n\nSo the final answer would be that objects 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates only when both are placed on it."}

So, from the actions taken, here's what happened step by step.\n\nFirst, the user put object 0 on the machine. Then added object 1. The machine was still off. Then they added object 2, and the light turned on. So when all three were on the machine, it activated. Then they removed 0 and 1, leaving only 2, but the machine turned off. Then they put 0 back, and the machine turned on again. \n\nWait, let's recheck. After putting all three on, the light was on. Then taking off 0 and 1 leaves only 2 on the machine. But the light went off. Then putting 0 back on (so objects 0 and 2 are on the machine) made the light come back on. \n\nSo, when only object 2 was on the machine, the light was off. When objects 0 and 2 were on, the light turned on. That suggests that having both 0 and 2 is sufficient. But wait, when all three were on, the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving 2) made it turn off. Then putting 0 back (so 0 and 2) turned it on again. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 need to be on the machine. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that at least two blickets are required. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when exactly two specific blickets are present. Let's consider the possibilities.\n\nWhen 0,1,2 are all on, light is on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving 2) turns it off. Then putting 0 back (so 0 and 2) turns it on again. So with 0 and 2, it's on. But when only 2 was on, it was off. So 2 alone isn't enough. But 0 and 2 together activate it. So maybe both 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. However, when all three were on, including 1, it was also on. But when 1 is added to 0 and 2, the machine stays on. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 are required, and 1 is irrelevant. But why did the machine turn on when all three were on? Because 0 and 2 were present. Then when 0 was removed (only 1 and 2), the machine turned off. Then when 0 was added back (with 2, but 1 is off), it turned on again. So this supports the idea that 0 and 2 are both blickets, and the machine requires both to be present. \n\nWait, but when they first put 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So in that case, with 0,1,2 on, it's on. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves 2, light off. Then adding 0 again (with 2) turns it on. So the activation seems to require the presence of both 0 and 2. Because when either is missing, it's off. But when both are present, regardless of 1, it's on. So that suggests that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. \n\nBut wait, when all three were on, including 1, it was on. Then taking off 0 and 1 (leaving 2) made it off. Then putting 0 back (with 2) made it on. So 0 and 2 are necessary. So the rule is that both 0 and 2 must be on the machine. Therefore, both are blickets, and the others (like 1) are not. \n\nSo, the answer for object 0 is True, it is a blicket."}

When all three were on the machine, the light turned on. Then, they started taking objects off. When they took off object 0 and 1, leaving only object 2 on the machine, the light turned off. Then they put object 0 back on the machine (so now objects 0 and 2 are on the machine), and the light turned on again.\n\nSo, when objects 0 and 2 are on the machine together, the light is on. When all three were on, it was on. But when only 0 and 1 were on (before adding 2), the light was off. Then when 0 was removed and 1 and 2 were on, the light stayed off until 0 was added back. \n\nWait, let me check again. The initial steps: putting 0 and 1 on the machine didn't turn the light on. Adding 2 made it turn on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving only 2) made the light turn off. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 2) turned the light on. \n\nSo the light is on when both 0 and 2 are present. Because when all three are on, it's on. When 2 is alone, it's off. When 0 is added to 2, it's on. But when 0 and 1 are on, it's off. Then adding 2 to 0 and 1 made it on. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 2 need to be present. \n\nWait, let's see the exact sequence:\n\n1. Put 0 on \u2192 light off.\n2. Put 1 on \u2192 light still off.\n3. Put 2 on \u2192 light on. So with 0,1,2 on, it's on. \n\nThen take off 0 \u2192 light off. So remaining 1 and 2: light off. Then take off 1 \u2192 light off (only 2 left). Then put 0 back on (now 0 and 2 on) \u2192 light on. \n\nSo when 0 and 2 are on, light is on. When 0,1,2 are on, light is on. When only 2 is on, it's off. When 0 and 1 are on, it's off. So the rule might be that the machine activates when both 0 and 2 are on it. Because adding 2 to 0 and 1 turned it on, and having 0 and 2 alone also turns it on. \n\nTherefore, object 1's presence doesn't affect the outcome. In the scenario where all three are on, it's on, but when 1 is removed (leaving 0 and 2), it's still on. So 1 isn't a blicket. The blickets must be 0 and 2. \n\nSo the answer should be False, since object 1 isn't necessary for the machine to turn on. Even when 1 is on the machine with others, it's the presence of 0 and 2 that matters. When 1 is removed and 0 and 2 are there, the machine works. So object 1 isn't a blicket."}
