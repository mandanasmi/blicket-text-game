You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

The function should:\n- Take as input a numpy boolean vector of length 8, where 0 means object is on floor, and 1 means object is on machine\n- Output a boolean, where 0 means machine light is off, and 1 means machine light is on\n- First construct a boolean mask indicating which object(s) are blickets, extract just the state of these objects, then define some function over these states to produce the state of the machine.\n- Only consider hypothesis where one or all objects that are blickets needs to be put on the machine.\n- Do not consider the \"sum\" operation. Only consider boolean operations.\n\nProduce 7 hypothesis, do not generate the same hypothesis.

The function should:\n- Take as input a numpy boolean vector of length 8, where 0 means object is on floor, and 1 means object is on machine\n- Output a boolean, where 0 means machine light is off, and 1 means machine light is on\n- First construct a boolean mask indicating which object(s) are blickets, extract just the state of these objects, then define some function over these states to produce the state of the machine.\n- Only consider hypothesis where one or all objects that are blickets needs to be put on the machine.\n- Do not consider the \"sum\" operation. Only consider boolean operations.\n\nProduce 7 hypothesis, do not generate the same hypothesis. Be diverse in both the blicket masks and the potential functions.\n\n\nDo not generate the hypothesis you have already eliminated: \ndef hypothesis_1(state):\n    # Object 0 is a blicket, and it alone can turn on the machine\n    blicket_mask = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=bool)\n    return np.any(state & blicket_mask)\ndef hypothesis_13(state):\n    #

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

The function should:\n- Take as input a numpy boolean vector of length 8, where 0 means object is on floor, and 1 means object is on machine\n- Output a boolean, where 0 means machine light is off, and 1 means machine light is on\n- First construct a boolean mask indicating which object(s) are blickets, extract just the state of these objects, then define some function over these states to produce the state of the machine.\n- Only consider hypothesis where one or all objects that are blickets needs to be put on the machine.\n- Do not consider the \"sum\" operation. Only consider boolean operations.\n\nProduce 7 hypothesis, do not generate the same hypothesis. Be diverse in both the blicket masks and the potential functions.\n\n\nDo not generate the hypothesis you have already eliminated: \ndef hypothesis_1(state):\n    # Object 0 is a blicket, and it alone can turn on the machine\n    blicket_mask = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=bool)\n    return np.any(state & blicket_mask)\ndef hypothesis_13(state):\n    #

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
