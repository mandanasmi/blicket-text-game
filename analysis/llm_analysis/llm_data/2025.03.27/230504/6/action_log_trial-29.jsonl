Initial tests:\n- Putting objects 0,1,2 one by one: machine only turned on when all 3 were on (suggesting AND rule at first)\n- But then removing 0 kept machine on, removing 1 turned it off (suggests object 1 is critical)\n- Later tests show machine turns on whenever object 1 is present, regardless of others\n\n2. Key findings:\n- Machine turns on when object 1 is on it, regardless of other objects\n- Objects 0 and 2 don't seem to affect the machine independently\n- This suggests object 1 is the only blicket, and the rule is \"machine turns on if any blicket is placed on it\"\n\nSince I've consistently observed that object 1 alone activates the machine while others don't, I can conclude:\n- Blicket: object 1\n- Rule: Machine turns on if at least one blicket is placed on it\n\nNo further testing needed as the pattern is clear.
