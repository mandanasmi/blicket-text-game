Finally, with just object 0 on, adding object 2 turned it on.\n\nThis suggests that:\n- Object 0 seems necessary but not sufficient (since alone it sometimes turns on the machine and sometimes doesn't)\n- The machine turns on when both object 0 and at least one other object are on it (either 1 or 2)\n- Therefore, object 0 is likely a blicket, and objects 1 and 2 are also blickets, but the rule requires at least two blickets to be on the machine simultaneously.\n\nTo confirm this, I should test putting object 1 and object 2 together without object 0.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When all three objects (0, 1, 2) were on the machine, the light turned on.\n2. When only objects 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was off.\n3. When only object 0 was on the machine, the light turned on (but this happened after object 2 had been on the machine previously - possible hysteresis effect).\n4. Most consistently, the light turns on when object 2 is on the machine, regardless of other objects' presence.\n\nThe key observations are:\n- The machine turns on when object 2 is present (with or without other objects)\n- The machine stays off when only objects 0 and 1 are present\n- Object 0 sometimes appears to turn on the machine, but only after object 2 has been involved\n\nThis suggests object 2 is the true blicket, while objects 0 and 1 are not. The occasional activation with object 0 alone might be a red herring or could indicate some memory effect, but the consistent pattern points to object 2 being the blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
