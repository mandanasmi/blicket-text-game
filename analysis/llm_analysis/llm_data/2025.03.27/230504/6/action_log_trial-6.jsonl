Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the sequence:\n- Objects 0+1+2: ON\n- Remove 2: OFF (expected, since 2 seems important)\n- Add 2 back: ON\n- Add 0 (already on): stays ON\n- Remove 0: stays ON (so 0 not essential)\n- Remove 1: OFF (so 1 seems important when with 2)\n- Add 2 alone: OFF (but earlier it was ON alone)\n- Add 1: ON\n\nThis suggests the rule might be more complex than a single blicket. Possible interpretations:\n1) Object 2 is a blicket but needs at least one other object (but earlier it worked alone)\n2) Objects 1 and 2 together form the activation condition\n3) There might be an \"AND\" relationship between some objects\n\nTo test this, I should check combinations of objects 1 and 2 without object 0.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
