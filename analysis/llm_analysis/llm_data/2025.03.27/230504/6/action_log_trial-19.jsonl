When only object 2 was on the machine (with 0 and 1 off), the machine turned on.\n2. When object 0 was on the machine (with 2 off), the machine sometimes turned on and sometimes didn't, depending on other factors.\n3. When object 1 was on the machine (with others off), the machine never turned on.\n4. The machine consistently turned on when object 2 was present, regardless of other objects.\n\nThis suggests object 2 is necessary for the machine to turn on, while the other objects' presence doesn't guarantee activation.
