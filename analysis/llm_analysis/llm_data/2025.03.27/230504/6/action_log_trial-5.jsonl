Pattern emerging:\n- The machine turns ON when at least one blicket is present\n- Object 1 alone turns on the machine \u2192 must be a blicket\n- Object 0 alone doesn't turn it on, but combined with 1 or 2 it does\n- Object 2 alone doesn't turn it on, but combined with 0 or 1 it does\n- This suggests object 0 and 2 might both be blickets that require another blicket to activate (conjunctive rule)\n\n3. Most likely rule:\nThe machine turns on when two or more blickets are present (conjunctive causation). The blickets are objects 0, 1, and 2, but they require at least two to be present to activate the machine.\n\nTo confirm this, I should test putting objects 0 and 2 together (without 1) to see if the machine turns on, which it did in step 21. This confirms the conjunctive rule.\n\nFinal conclusion:\n- Blickets: objects 0, 1, and 2\n- Rule: The machine turns on when two or more blickets are placed on it simultaneously.\n\nSince we've confirmed this through multiple tests, we can exit.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
