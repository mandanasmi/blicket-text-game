Later, when only object 0 was on the machine again, the light turned on (but this was after object 1 had been on the machine previously - suggesting some memory effect or that the rule might be more complex).\n5. However, in another test with only object 0 on the machine, the light stayed off until object 1 was added.\n\nThe most consistent pattern is that the machine turns on when both object 0 and object 1 are present together, suggesting they are both blickets that need to be combined to activate the machine.
