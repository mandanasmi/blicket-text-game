When object 0 and 2 were on the machine together, it turned on (but object 1 was also on at this point).\n\nFrom these observations:\n- Object 1 alone can turn on the machine (so it's definitely a blicket).\n- Object 0 seems to only turn on the machine when combined with another blicket (object 1 or possibly 2).\n- The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present (object 1 is confirmed, object 2's status is unclear).\n\nCrucial test: When only object 0 and 2 were on the machine (step 13), the machine turned on.
