Later tests showed:\n   - Object 1 alone can turn on machine\n   - Object 2 alone can turn on machine\n   - Object 0 alone can turn on machine\n   - But when only object 2 is on machine, removing it turns machine off\n   - When object 0 and 2 are on, removing 0 turns machine off (suggesting 2 alone wasn't keeping it on)\n\nThis suggests a more complex rule than simple individual activation. The machine seems to require at least one blicket to be on it, but the activation might depend on combinations.\n\nKey observations:\n- Object 1 seems consistently able to activate the machine\n- Object 2 seems able to activate the machine\n- Object 0's behavior is inconsistent - sometimes it seems to activate, other times not\n\nPossible rule: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it, and blickets are objects 1 and 2.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When any single object is placed on the machine, the light turns on (initial tests with objects 0, 1, and 2 individually).\n2. However, when object 2 is the only object on the machine (after removing object 0), the light turns off (step 28-29).\n3. The light stays on when object 0 is alone on the machine (multiple instances).\n4. The light also stays on when object 1 is alone on the machine (step 21).\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- Objects 0 and 1 can independently activate the machine (are blickets).\n- Object 2 cannot independently activate the machine (not a blicket), though it may have appeared to activate the machine initially when placed with other objects.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
