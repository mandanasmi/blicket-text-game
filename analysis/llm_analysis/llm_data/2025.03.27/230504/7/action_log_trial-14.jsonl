You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, putting any single object (0, 1, or 2) on the machine turns it on. This suggests each object alone can activate the machine.\n2. When object 0 and 1 are on the machine, removing either one turns the machine off, showing both are necessary to keep it on in that configuration.\n3. However, when object 1 and 2 are on the machine, removing object 1 turns it off but removing object 2 keeps it on (when object 1 remains). This shows object 2 is not necessary for activation when object 1 is present.\n4. Similarly, when object 0 and 2 are on the machine, removing object 0 turns it off but removing object 2 keeps it on (when object 0 remains). This shows object 2 is not necessary for activation when object 0 is present.\n\nThe key insight is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. Object 2's presence is never necessary to keep the machine on when another object is present, suggesting it's not a blicket. The machine stays on with just object 0 or 1, but not with just object 2 (when others are removed).\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
