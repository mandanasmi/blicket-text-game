You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Later, putting object 1 alone turned it on again, and adding other objects didn't change that.\n\nKey findings:\n- Object 1 alone turns the machine on (must be a blicket).\n- Object 0 alone doesn't turn it on (not a blicket).\n- Object 2's presence doesn't affect the machine's state when object 1 is present, and doesn't turn it on alone (since when only object 2 was on the machine, it was off).\n\nTherefore, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
