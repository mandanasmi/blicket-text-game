Similarly, when only object 2 is on the machine and is removed, the light turns off.\n\nThis suggests that objects 0 and 1 are blickets (their presence keeps the machine on), while object 2 is not a blicket (its presence doesn't affect the machine's state - the machine only stays on if at least one blicket is present).\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
