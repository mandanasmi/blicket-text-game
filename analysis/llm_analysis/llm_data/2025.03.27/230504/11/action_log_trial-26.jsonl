Later tests showed that object 2 alone doesn't turn the machine on (steps 16-17).\n4. Object 1 alone turns the machine on (step 20).\n5. Object 0 alone turns the machine on (step 27).\n6. When both 0 and 1 are on, removing either keeps the machine on (steps 24-25, 28-29).\n\nFrom this, I can infer:\n- Object 2 is not a blicket (doesn't affect machine state)\n- Objects 0 and 1 are blickets\n- The rule appears to be \"OR\" - machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it\n\nTo confirm, I'll test removing both blickets after having them on the machine.\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When only object 0 is on the machine, the light turns on.\n2. When only object 1 is on the machine, the light turns on.\n3. When only object 2 is on the machine, the light stays off (observed in steps 16-17).\n4. The light only turns on when at least one of object 0 or object 1 is on the machine, regardless of object 2's presence.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 2 never causes the machine to turn on by itself, and its presence or absence doesn't affect the machine's state when other objects are present. Therefore, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 3 objects scattered around the room.
