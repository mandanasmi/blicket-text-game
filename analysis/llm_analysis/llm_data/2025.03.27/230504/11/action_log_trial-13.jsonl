Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let's analyze the observations to determine if object 2 is a blicket:\n\n1. When object 2 was placed alone on the machine (after object 1 failed to activate it), the machine turned on. This suggests object 2 has blicktness.\n2. When object 2 was removed from a configuration where it was the only object on the machine, the machine turned off.\n3. When object 2 was present with other objects (like object 1), the machine stayed on, but removing object 2 didn't always turn it off (because other blickets were present).\n\nThe key evidence is that object 2 can independently activate the machine, and its removal can deactivate the machine when it's the only active blicket. This shows its state is not independent of the machine's state.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
