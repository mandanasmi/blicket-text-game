When object 1 is removed (leaving only object 0), the light turns off.\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- Both object 0 and object 1 are blickets because their presence affects the machine's state.\n- Object 2 was only tested once (alone on the machine), and the light turned on. However, we never tested combinations with object 2 and other objects to see if it's necessary for activation. Since the machine turns on with just object 0 or object 1 alone, object 2's activation might have been coincidental (or it might not be a blicket at all).\n\nGiven that the machine can be activated without object 2, and we never observed object 2 being necessary for activation in any combination, it's likely not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
