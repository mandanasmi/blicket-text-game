When only object 1 is on the machine, the light stays off (observed when object 0 was removed while object 1 was already on the machine).\n3. When only object 2 is on the machine, the light turns on.\n4. When both object 0 and object 1 are on the machine, the light is on.\n5. When object 0 is removed while object 1 remains, the light turns off.\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- Object 0 is a blicket (its presence affects the machine state).\n- Object 1 is not a blicket (its presence alone doesn't turn on the machine).\n- Object 2 behaves similarly to object 0 - when placed alone on the machine, it turns the light on, suggesting it's a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
