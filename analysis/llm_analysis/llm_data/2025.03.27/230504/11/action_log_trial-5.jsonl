When object 1 is added, the light stays on. When object 1 is removed, the light stays on (implying object 0 alone can keep it on).\n4. Similarly, when object 1 is on alone, the light is on. When object 0 is added, the light stays on. When object 0 is removed, the light stays on (implying object 1 alone can keep it on).\n5. For object 2: when it's placed alone, the light turns on, but we didn't test whether removing it while others are present affects the light.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that both object 0 and object 1 can independently turn on the machine (they are blickets), while object 2's effect is unclear - it might just be coincidental that the light was on when it was placed (since others were already keeping it on). The key test we're missing is whether object 2 alone can keep the machine on when others are removed.\n\nHowever, in the initial tests:\n- When all objects were on the machine and we removed object 0 and 1, the light stayed on until object 2 was removed, suggesting object 2 was also contributing to keeping the light on.\n\nTherefore, object 2 is likely also a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
