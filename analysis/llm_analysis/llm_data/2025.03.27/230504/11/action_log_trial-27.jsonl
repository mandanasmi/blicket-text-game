Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let's analyze the observations step by step to determine if object 2 is a blicket:\n\n1. When only object 0 was on the machine, the light was off.\n2. Adding object 1 turned the light on (suggesting object 1 is a blicket).\n3. Removing object 0 kept the light on (confirming object 0 isn't necessary for activation).\n4. Adding object 2 kept the light on (but we already had object 1 on the machine).\n5. Removing object 1 kept the light on (now only object 2 was on the machine, and light stayed on).\n6. Removing object 2 turned the light off (showing object 2 alone can keep the light on).\n7. Later, putting object 2 back on alone turned the light on again.\n\nThe key observations are:\n- The light turns on when object 2 is placed alone on the machine.\n- The light turns off when object 2 is removed (with no other objects on the machine).\nThis shows object 2's presence directly affects the machine's state, meaning it has blicktness.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
