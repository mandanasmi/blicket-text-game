When only object 0 was on the machine, the light stayed off.\n2. When objects 0 and 1 were on the machine together, the light turned on.\n3. When objects 1 and 2 were on the machine together, the light turned on.\n4. When only object 1 was on the machine, the light stayed off.\n5. When objects 0 and 1 were on the machine together again, the light turned on.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n- The machine turns on when at least two objects are placed on it, and at least one of them is a blicket.\n- Object 1 seems to be a blicket because combinations involving it turn the machine on.\n- Object 0 is not a blicket because putting it alone doesn't turn the machine on, and it only turns on when combined with object 1.\n- Object 2's status is unclear from these observations, but since the machine turned on when it was combined with object 1, this doesn't tell us whether object 2 is a blicket or not (since object 1 could be the one causing the activation).\n\nHowever, we have one crucial observation: when objects 1 and 2 were on the machine together, the light turned on. Since we know object 1 is a blicket, this doesn't prove object 2 is a blicket (as object 1 alone could have activated it when combined with any object). We have no evidence that object 2 can activate the machine by itself or in combination with non-blickets.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that object 2 is a blicket based on the current evidence.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
