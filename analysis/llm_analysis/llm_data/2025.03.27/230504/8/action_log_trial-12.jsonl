Putting object 1 alone - light stayed off\n3. Putting object 2 alone - light turned on\n4. Then putting object 1 with object 2 - light turned on\n5. Then putting object 0 with object 1 - light turned on\n6. Removing object 1 left object 0 alone - light turned off\n7. Later, object 1 alone - light off, but adding object 2 turned it on\n8. Finally, with objects 1 and 2 on, removing object 0 didn't affect the light\n\nFrom this pattern, it seems:\n- Object 2 alone can turn on the machine\n- Object 1 needs to be combined with another object to turn on the machine\n- Object 0 doesn't seem to affect the machine's state\n\nTherefore, the rule appears to be: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it. Object 2 is definitely a blicket, object 1 might be a blicket (but only works in combination), and object 0 is not a blicket.\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 1 alone again:\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
