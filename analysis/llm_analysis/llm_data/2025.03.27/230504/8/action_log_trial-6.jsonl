You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 0 was added back (now 0 and 2), the light turned on.\n4. When object 1 was removed (leaving just 0 and 2), the light remained on.\n5.

When object 0 was added (now 0, 1, 2), the light turned on again.\n\nFrom these observations:\n- The machine turns on when both object 0 and object 2 are present (steps 3, 4).\n- The machine does not turn on with just object 2 (step 5) or with objects 1 and 2 (step 6).\n- Object 1 doesn't seem to affect the machine's state when combined with object 2.\n\nThis suggests that object 2 is necessary but not sufficient alone to turn on the machine - it needs to be combined with object 0. Therefore, object 2 is indeed a blicket, but it requires another blicket (object 0) to activate the machine.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
