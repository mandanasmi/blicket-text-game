You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Removing object 0 while keeping 1 and 2 on kept the light on.\n4. Removing object 2 (leaving only 1) turned the light off.\n5. Later, putting only object 0 and 2 on the machine kept the light off.\n6. Adding object 1 (with 0 and 2 already on) turned the light on.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the machine only turns on when object 2 AND object 1 are both on it (regardless of object 0's presence).
