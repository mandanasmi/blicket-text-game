Likely rule:\nThe machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Object 2 is definitely a blicket. Objects 0 and 1 might both be non-blickets (since neither activates alone), but their combination activates - this suggests an alternative rule where the sum of their weights or some interaction activates.\n\nHowever, the simplest rule that fits most observations is that object 2 is the only blicket, and the machine turns on when any blicket is present.
