Initial observations:\n   - Putting object 0 alone on the machine did not turn it on.\n   - Putting object 1 alone on the machine did not turn it on.\n   - Putting object 2 alone on the machine turned it on.\n   - Removing object 2 turned the machine off, and re-adding it turned it back on.\n   - Adding object 0 to the machine (while object 2 is already on it) kept the machine on.\n\n2. Hypotheses:\n   - Object 2 is likely a blicket, as it alone can turn the machine on.\n   - Objects 0 and 1 are likely not blickets, as they did not turn the machine on individually.\n   - The rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\n\n3. Next steps:\n   - Test whether object 1 can turn the machine on when combined with object 2 (though this seems redundant since object 2 alone works).\n   - Alternatively, confirm that objects 0 and 1 alone or together do not turn the machine on.\n\n4. Current conclusion:\n   - Object 2 is a blicket; objects 0 and 1 are not.\n   - The rule is likely: \"The machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\"\n\n**Command:**\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
