When all three objects (0, 1, 2) were on the machine, the light turned on.\n2. When only object 2 was on the machine, the light was off.\n3. When objects 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on.\n4. When only object 0 was on the machine, the light was on.\n5. When only object 1 was on the machine, the light was off.\n6. When objects 0 and 2 were on the machine, the light was on.\n7. When objects 1 and 2 were on the machine, the light was on.\n\nFrom these observations:\n- The machine turns on when object 0 is present (regardless of other objects).\n- The machine also turns on when both objects 1 and 2 are present together.\n- Object 2 alone doesn't turn on the machine, but in combination with object 1 it does.\n\nThis suggests object 2 is only a blicket in combination with object 1, but not independently. However, the standard definition of a blicket is that it can activate the machine by itself (though possibly in combination with others). Since object 2 cannot activate the machine alone, it's not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
