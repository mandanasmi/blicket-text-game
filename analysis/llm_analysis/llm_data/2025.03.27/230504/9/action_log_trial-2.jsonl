Emerging pattern:\n   - object 2 never activates the machine alone or in combination\n   - object 1 seems necessary to keep machine ON (when removed, machine turns OFF)\n   - object 0 can activate machine alone, but machine stays ON only if object 1 is present\n\n3. Possible rule:\n   - The machine turns ON when at least one blicket is present\n   - object 1 is a blicket (required for activation)\n   - object 0 may be a blicket that can activate but not sustain\n   - object 2 is not a blicket\n\nTo confirm, I should test if object 0 alone can sustain the machine after activation.\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

When object 0 is placed alone on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n2. When object 1 is placed alone on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n3. When object 2 is placed alone on the machine (after removing all other objects), the light remains off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n4. The machine stays on when either object 0 or object 1 is present, even if the other is removed, confirming they are blickets.\n5.
