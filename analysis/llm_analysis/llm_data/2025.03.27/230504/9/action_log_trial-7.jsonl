When I removed object 2, the light turned off.\n3. Putting object 0 alone turned the light on.\n4. Putting object 1 alone also turned the light on.\n5. With both objects 1 and 2 on the machine, removing object 0 kept the light on.\n6. When only object 2 was on the machine, removing it turned the light off.\n\nFrom this, it seems:\n- Each object individually can turn the machine on (objects 0, 1, and 2)\n- The machine stays on as long as at least one object is on it\n- The machine turns off only when no objects are on it\n\nThis suggests that all objects might be blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is placed on it (OR rule).\n\nTo confirm this, I should test if the machine turns on with any single object, and turns off only when all are removed.\n\nNext step: Test object 1 alone.\n\n> put object 1 on the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
