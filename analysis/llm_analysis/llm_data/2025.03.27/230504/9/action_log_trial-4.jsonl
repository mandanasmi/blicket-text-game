You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it.

When any single object (0, 1, or 2) was placed on the machine alone, the machine turned on. This suggests each object individually can activate the machine.\n2. When all objects were removed from the machine, the light turned off.\n3. When objects 0 and 1 were on the machine together (after removing object 2), the machine stayed on.\n\nHowever, the critical observation is that when object 2 was the last object removed from the machine (with objects 0 and 1 already removed), the machine turned off. This shows that object 2 was the only object keeping the machine on at that point, proving it can activate the machine by itself.\n\nSince all three objects were shown to independently activate the machine, they must all be blickets.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
