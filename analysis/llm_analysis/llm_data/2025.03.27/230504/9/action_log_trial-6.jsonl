You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, object 0 was on the machine and the light was off.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on.\n3.

When object 2 was removed, the light turned off.\n6. Object 0 never caused the light to turn on, whether alone or with other objects.\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- Object 1 and object 2 each independently can turn the machine on (they are blickets).\n- Object 0 cannot turn the machine on (not a blicket).\n- The rule appears to be \"the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it.\"\n\nSince object 2 alone kept the machine on when placed, it must be a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
