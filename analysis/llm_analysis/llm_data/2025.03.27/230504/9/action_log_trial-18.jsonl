Initial tests showed that any single object turns the machine on when placed alone (objects 0, 1, 2 all worked individually at first)\n2. However, later tests showed contradictions:\n   - With object 2 on machine, removing object 0 turned machine off (but object 2 was still on)\n   - With object 1 on machine, removing object 2 turned machine on (which shouldn't happen if object 1 alone could activate it)\n3. Key pattern emerges: The machine turns on when exactly one object is placed on it. Multiple objects cancel each other out (machine turns off), and removing the last object turns it off.\n\nThis suggests the rule is: The machine turns on when exactly one object is placed on it, regardless of which object it is. Therefore, all objects are blickets, but the activation rule depends on the count, not the identity.\n\nFinal answer: All objects (0, 1, 2) are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one object is placed on it.\n\nSince we've deduced the rule and identified all objects as blickets, we can exit.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
