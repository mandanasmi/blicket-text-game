When only object 0 is on the machine: light is off\n2. When objects 0 and 1 are on the machine: light is on\n3. When object 0 is removed (only object 1 remains): light turns off\n4. When object 0 is put back: light turns on\n5. When object 2 is added to object 0 and 1: light stays on\n6. When object 0 is removed (objects 1 and 2 remain): light turns off\n7. When object 0 is put back (objects 0, 1, 2): light turns on\n8. When object 2 is alone on machine: light is off\n\nKey findings:\n- The machine only turns on when both object 0 and object 1 are present\n- Object 2's presence or absence doesn't affect the machine's state when object 0 or 1 are present/absent\n- The rule appears to be that the machine turns on if and only if both object 0 AND object 1 are on it\n\nSince a blicket is defined as an object whose state affects the machine's state, and object 2's presence doesn't affect the machine's behavior, it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
