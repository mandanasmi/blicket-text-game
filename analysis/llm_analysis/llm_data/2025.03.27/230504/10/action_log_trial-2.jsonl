You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them.

When all three objects (0, 1, 2) were on the machine, the light turned on.\n2. When we removed object 0, the light remained on.\n3. When we removed object 1 next, the light turned off - this suggests object 1 was necessary to keep the light on when object 2 was present.\n4. Later tests showed that having both object 1 and object 2 on the machine turns the light on, but having just object 1 doesn't turn it on (from earlier steps).\n\nThis suggests that object 1 has an effect on the machine's state when combined with object 2, meaning it's not independent of the machine's state.
