Initial state: object 0 on machine (light off), objects 1 and 2 on floor (light off)\n2. When we put object 1 on machine (with object 0 already on), light stays off\n3. When we put object 2 on machine (with object 0 already on), light stays off\n4. When we put object 0 on machine alone, light turns on\n5. When we put object 1 on machine (with object 0 already on), light turns on\n6. When we remove object 1 (leaving object 0 on), light turns off\n7. When we put object 2 on machine (with object 0 already on), light stays off\n8. When we put object 1 on machine (with object 0 already on), light turns on again\n\nKey findings:\n- Object 0 alone can turn on the machine\n- Object 1 alone cannot turn on the machine (when tried with object 2)\n- Object 2 never causes the machine to turn on in any configuration\n- The machine turns on when either object 0 is alone or when both object 0 and object 1 are present\n\nConclusion: Object 2 never affects the machine's state, so it's not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
