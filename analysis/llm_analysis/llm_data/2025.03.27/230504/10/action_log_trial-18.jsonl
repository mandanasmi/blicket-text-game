Initial state: objects 1 and 2 on machine, machine off \u2192 suggests neither alone activates it\n2. Putting object 0 on machine turns it on \u2192 suggests object 0 might be a blicket\n3. Taking object 1 off keeps machine on \u2192 suggests object 1 isn't necessary\n4. Taking object 0 off turns machine off \u2192 confirms object 0 is important\n5. Putting object 1 on alone doesn't turn machine on \u2192 confirms object 1 isn't a blicket\n6. Putting object 2 on alone turns machine on \u2192 suggests object 2 might be a blicket\n7. When both object 0 and 2 are on, machine stays on\n8. Taking object 2 off turns machine off (when object 0 is on) \u2192 confirms object 2 is important\n\nKey findings:\n- Machine turns on when either object 0 OR object 2 is on it (OR relationship)\n- Object 1 never affects the machine's state\n- Both object 0 and object 2 independently can turn the machine on\n\nTherefore, object 2 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
