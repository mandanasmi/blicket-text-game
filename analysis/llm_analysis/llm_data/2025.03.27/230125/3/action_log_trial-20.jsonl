Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, let's analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. When object 2 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on.\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n3. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n4. When object 0 and object 1 were tested together, the light was on with object 1 present.\n5. Object 2 was also tested alone and the light was off when it was removed.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- Object 1 is definitely a blicket since it consistently turns the machine on.\n- Object 0 does not seem to activate the machine on its own.\n- Object 2 turned the machine on when it was first placed on the machine, but when it was put back on after being removed, the light was off.\n\nSince object 2 turned the machine on at least once, it suggests that it could be a blicket. However, the inconsistency when it was placed back on the machine indicates that it may not be a reliable blicket.\n\nGiven the evidence, I conclude that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
