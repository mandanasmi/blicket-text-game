However, I need to determine if they are blickets by testing combinations and observing the machine's response.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**: I will test combinations of the objects to see if the machine turns on or off. Since I know that each object can turn the machine on individually, I will now test combinations of two objects to see if the machine's response changes.\n\n3. **Elimination**: If I find that the machine turns on with certain combinations and off with others, I can start to infer which objects are blickets based on their combinations.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: I will take object 0 off the machine and then test object 1 and object 2 together to see if they can turn the machine on without object 0.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I will execute the following command:\n\n> take object 0 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
