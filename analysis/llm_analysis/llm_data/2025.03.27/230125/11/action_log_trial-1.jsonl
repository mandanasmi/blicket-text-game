When object 0 was on the machine, the light was on.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light was also on.\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light was on as well.\n4. Removing object 2 from the machine did not turn the light off, indicating that the machine remained on with object 0 or 1 present.\n5. Object 2 was also able to turn the machine on when placed on it.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n- Object 0 and object 1 can independently turn the machine on.\n- Object 2 can also turn the machine on when placed on it, but it was not tested alone without the presence of other objects.\n\nSince the machine can remain on with object 0 or 1 present, we cannot definitively conclude that object 2 is a blicket based solely on the information gathered. It could be that object 2 does not have blicktness if it does not independently affect the machine's state.\n\nThus, based on the information collected, we cannot confirm that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
