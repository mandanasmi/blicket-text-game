Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n2. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on.\n3. When object 1 was removed, the light remained on, indicating that object 1 is not the only cause for the machine to turn on.\n4. When object 2 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n5. Object 0 was placed on the machine multiple times, but it did not affect the state of the machine in a way that indicated it was a blicket.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 2 is indeed a blicket because its presence is necessary for the machine to turn on, indicating a relationship between object 2 and the machine.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
