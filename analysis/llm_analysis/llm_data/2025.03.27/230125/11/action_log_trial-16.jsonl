You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light does not turn on. It has been placed on the machine multiple times, and the light remains off. This indicates that object 2 does not activate the machine.\n\nSince object 2 does not cause the machine to turn on in any of the tests, it does not have the blicktness required to be classified as a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
