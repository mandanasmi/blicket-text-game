You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine based on the observations made.\n\n1. **Object 1**: When it was placed on the machine, the light turned on consistently. When it was taken off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light was off when it was the only object present. This indicates that object 0 does not activate the machine on its own.\n\n3. **Object 2**: The light turned on when object 2 was placed on the machine, but it also turned on when object 1 was present. When object 2 was taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that it does not activate the machine independently. However, it was also observed that the light remained on when object 1 was present, which complicates the inference about object 2.\n\nFrom the observations, we can conclude:\n- Object 1 is a blicket.\n- Object 0 is not a blicket.\n- Object 2's status is uncertain because it only turned the light on when combined with other objects, particularly object 1.\n\nSince object 2 has not been shown to activate the machine independently and its activation seems dependent on the presence of object 1, we can conclude that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
