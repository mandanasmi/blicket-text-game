When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. When it is removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n2. Object 2 was placed on the machine and the light turned on, but when it was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, as it was only on when object 1 was also present.\n3. Object 0 was placed on the machine multiple times, but the light remained off, indicating that it is not a blicket.\n\nSince object 2 does not independently cause the machine to turn on and only did so when object 1 was present, we can conclude that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
