When taken off, the light remained on, indicating that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Object 1**: Similar to object 0, when placed on the machine, the light turned on. When taken off, the light turned off, suggesting that object 1 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light was off, indicating that object 2 does not activate the machine. Additionally, when taken off the machine, the light remained on, which further suggests that object 2 does not have any effect on the machine.\n\nGiven this analysis, object 2 does not seem to have the blicktness required to activate the machine.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
