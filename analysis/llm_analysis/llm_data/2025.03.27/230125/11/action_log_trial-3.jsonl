Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, we need to analyze the behavior of the machine in relation to the objects.\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. However, when object 2 is removed, the light turns off only when object 1 is also removed. This suggests that object 2 may also be a blicket, as it can independently turn the machine on when placed on it.\n\nSince object 2 can turn the machine on when placed on it, it indicates that it has some form of blicktness. Therefore, based on the information collected, object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
