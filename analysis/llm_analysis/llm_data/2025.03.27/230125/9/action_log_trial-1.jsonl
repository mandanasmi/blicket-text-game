When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. When it was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, but when it was the only object on the machine, the light did not turn on when it was removed. This suggests that object 2 does not independently activate the machine.\n4. The light turned on when both object 1 and object 2 were on the machine, but since object 1 is already confirmed as a blicket, we cannot conclude that object 2 is a blicket based on this action alone.\n\nSince object 2 did not independently activate the machine when it was the only object present, we can conclude that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
