Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Based on the interactions with the machine, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: Similar to object 0, when placed on the machine, the light turns on, and when removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on, but when removed, the light remains on. This suggests that object 2 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, as it does not change the state of the machine when removed.\n\nSince object 2 does not independently cause the machine to turn on when it is removed, it cannot be classified as a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
