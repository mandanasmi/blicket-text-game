Removing object 1 or object 2 from the machine turned the light off, indicating that at least one of them is a blicket.\n5. Object 0 was also confirmed to be a blicket since the light remained on when it was placed on the machine.\n\nHowever, when object 2 was tested alone (by removing object 1), the light turned off, indicating that object 2 does not activate the machine by itself. \n\nSince the light was off when object 2 was removed, it suggests that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
