Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'.

When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light remained off, indicating that object 0 is not a blicket.\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on, suggesting that object 2 could be a blicket.\n4. However, when object 2 was taken off the machine and then placed back on, the light turned on again, which is consistent with it being a blicket.\n\nSince object 2 turned the machine on when placed on it, it is reasonable to conclude that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
