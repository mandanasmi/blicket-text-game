The light on the machine is now on.\n\nBased on the information you have gathered, answer the following question: Is object 2 a blicket?\n\nFirst briefly reason and think about the information collected. Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, let's analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light was off.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on as well.\n4. Removing object 1 or object 2 from the machine turned the light off, indicating that at least one of them is a blicket.\n5. Object 1 consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine, while object 0 did not.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- Object 1 is definitely a blicket since it consistently activates the machine.\n- Object 2 also activated the machine when placed on it, but it was not tested alone without object 1.\n\nHowever, when object 2 was placed on the machine alone, the light was off, indicating that it does not activate the machine by itself. Therefore, object 2 cannot be a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
