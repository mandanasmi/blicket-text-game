You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered:\n\n1. When object 2 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on. This suggests that object 2 could be a blicket.\n2. However, when object 2 was placed on the machine with object 0, the light was off. This indicates that object 0 might not be a blicket, or that the combination of object 0 and object 2 does not activate the machine.\n3. Object 0 consistently turned the machine on when placed alone, which suggests it is a blicket.\n4. Object 1 did not activate the machine when placed alone, indicating it is likely not a blicket.\n\nSince object 2 turned the machine on by itself but did not activate it in combination with object 0, it is uncertain whether it is a blicket or not. However, the evidence suggests that object 2 is not a blicket because it did not contribute to activating the machine when combined with object 0, which is confirmed to be a blicket.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
