You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.\n2. When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on.\n3. When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light does not turn on by itself, and it does not contribute to the light being on when combined with other objects.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n- Object 1 and object 0 are likely blickets since they can independently cause the machine to turn on.\n- Object 2 does not seem to have any effect on the machine, as it does not turn on the light when placed on the machine alone or in combination with other objects that do not activate the machine.\n\nTherefore, object 2 does not have the blicktness required to be classified as a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
