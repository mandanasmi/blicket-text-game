Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n2. When object 2 was taken off the machine, the light turned off.\n3. When object 2 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on again.\n\nThis indicates that object 2 has a direct influence on the machine's state, suggesting that it is likely a blicket.\n\nAdditionally, we observed that object 1 also consistently turned the machine on when placed on it, while object 0 did not seem to affect the machine's state.\n\nSince object 2 has shown a consistent ability to turn the machine on, it can be concluded that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
