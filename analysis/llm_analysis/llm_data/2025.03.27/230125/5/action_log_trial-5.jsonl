When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. However, when it is taken off, the light turns off.\n2. Object 1 does not seem to activate the machine when placed on it, as the light remains off regardless of its state.\n3. Object 2, when placed on the machine, consistently turns the light on, indicating that it has a relationship with the machine.\n\nSince object 2 consistently activates the machine when placed on it, it suggests that object 2 is indeed a blicket. \n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
