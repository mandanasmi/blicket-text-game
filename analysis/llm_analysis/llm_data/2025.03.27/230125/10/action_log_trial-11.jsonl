When object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light was off. This suggests that object 0 does not activate the machine by itself.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on, suggesting that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4.
