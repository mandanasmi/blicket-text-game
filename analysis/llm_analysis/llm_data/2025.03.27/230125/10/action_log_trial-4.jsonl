Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'.

When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but when it was the only object on the machine with object 0 and object 1, the light turned off when all were removed. This indicates that object 2 does not independently activate the machine.\n\nSince the light turned off when object 2 was removed while object 0 and object 1 were present, it suggests that object 2 does not have blicktness on its own.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
