Based on my previous interactions, I have observed the following:\n\n1. When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.\n2. When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on.\n3. When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light does not turn on.\n4. Removing object 1 or object 2 from the machine turns the light off, while removing object 0 does not affect the light.\n\nFrom this, I can infer that:\n- Object 1 and object 2 are likely blickets since they can turn the machine on.\n- Object 0 does not seem to have blicktness since it does not turn the machine on.\n\nTo further confirm my findings, I will take object 1 off the machine and then put object 2 on the machine again to see if the light turns on. This will help reinforce the idea that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
