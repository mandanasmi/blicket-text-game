You don't know which rule the machine follows a priori.\n- If the rule is \"disjunctive\", the machine turns on when any of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- If the rule is \"conjunctive\", the machine only turns on when all of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- You should first think about a number of hypothesis for which objects might be blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.
