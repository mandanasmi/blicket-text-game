Currently, only object 3 is on the machine, and the machine is off.\n Our goal is to identify which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on.\n\n Since we don't know the rule, we need to experiment by placing objects on the machine and observing when the machine turns on.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that currently, object 3 is on the machine and the machine is off. So either object 3 is not a blicket, or the rule requires more than one object, or object 3 alone isn't sufficient.\n\n 2. We should start by testing individual objects to see if any single object can turn the machine on.\n\n However, note that object 3 is already on the machine and the machine is off. So we can take object 3 off and then try other objects one by one.\n\n But we have 32 steps, so we can plan systematically.\n\n Plan:\n - First, clear the machine: take object 3 off the machine so we start with a clean slate.\n - Then, test each object individually by putting it on the machine and observing the machine's state.\n\n However, we must remember that the rule might require multiple objects. So if we test one by one and none turn it on, we'll know that at least two are needed.\n\n Let's start:\n\n Step 1: Take object 3 off the machine to have no objects on the machine."}
