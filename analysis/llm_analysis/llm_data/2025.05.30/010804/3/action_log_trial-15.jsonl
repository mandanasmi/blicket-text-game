You don't know which rule the machine follows a priori.\n- If the rule is \"disjunctive\", the machine turns on when any of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- If the rule is \"conjunctive\", the machine only turns on when all of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- You should always consider first the hypothesis that all the blickets have to be on the machine for it to turn on (i.e. \"conjunctive\" rule).
