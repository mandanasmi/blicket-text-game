You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them.

You don't know which rule the machine follows a priori.\n- If the rule is \"disjunctive\", the machine turns on when any of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- If the rule is \"conjunctive\", the machine only turns on when all of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- You should always consider first the hypothesis that all the blickets have to be on the machine for it to turn on (i.e. \"conjunctive\" rule). In this case, the objects required for the machine to turn on are all considered \"blickets\".
