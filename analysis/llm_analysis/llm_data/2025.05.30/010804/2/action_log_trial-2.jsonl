You don't know which rule the machine follows a priori.\n- If the rule is \"disjunctive\", the machine turns on when any of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- If the rule is \"conjunctive\", the machine only turns on when all of the blickets are placed on top of it.\n- You should always consider first the hypothesis that all the blickets have to be on the machine for it to turn on (i.e. \"conjunctive\" rule).

The machine turned on when objects 2, 3, and 4 were on it together.\n2. Removing object 2 turned the machine off, indicating object 2 is a blicket.\n3. The machine stayed on when objects 0, 1, 3, and 5 were removed, suggesting they are not necessary for the machine to turn on.\n4. The machine turned off when object 4 was removed, indicating object 4 is a blicket.\n5. The machine stayed on when object 3 was removed, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\nSince object 7 was never tested individually or in a combination that turned the machine on, and given that the machine turned on with objects 2 and 4, it is likely that object 7 is not a blicket.
