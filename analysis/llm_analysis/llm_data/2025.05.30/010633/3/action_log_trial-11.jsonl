You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them.

Then, you should think about which action you should take which you expect to maximally reduce this hypothesis space. \n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- You should first think about a number of hypothesis for which objects might be blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine. Then, you should think about which action you should take which you expect to maximally reduce this hypothesis space. \n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
