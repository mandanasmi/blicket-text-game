When object 2 is removed, the machine turns off, indicating that object 2 is necessary for the machine to turn on. Object 3 also seems to be a blicket because when both objects 2 and 3 are on the machine, the machine stays on, but when object 2 is removed, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 3 alone does not turn the machine on, but it contributes to the machine being on when combined with object 2.\n\nThe current hypothesis is that object 2 is a blicket and necessary for the machine to turn on, and object 3 might be a blicket that works in conjunction with object 2. The rule might be that object 2 is required, and any additional blicket (like object 3) can also be present.\n\nTo further test this hypothesis, I will try putting object 3 on the machine alone to see if it turns on, confirming if object 3 is a blicket that requires object 2 to activate the machine.\n\n> take object 4 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- You should first think about a number of hypothesis for which objects might be blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine. Then, you should think about which action you should take which you expect to maximally reduce this hypothesis space. \n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
