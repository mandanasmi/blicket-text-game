You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> put object 0 on machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 1 on machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 2 on machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> put object 3 on machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 2 off machine\nYou took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 3 off machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 2 on machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine.

The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 2 off machine\nYou took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> exit\nExiting the episode.\n\nBased on the information you have gathered, answer the following question: Is object 3 a blicket?\n\nFirst briefly reason and think about the information collected. Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Object 3 is a blicket. When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, indicating it is a blicket. Additionally, when object 2 is removed and object 3 remains, the light stays on, confirming object 3's status as a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 85, "prompt_tokens": 748, "total_tokens": 833}}
