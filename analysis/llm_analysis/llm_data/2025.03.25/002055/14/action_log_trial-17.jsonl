When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light did not turn on. However, when it was placed on the machine with object 2 (which we know turns the light on), the light remained on. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. However, we need to consider that it was also placed on the machine with object 2, which we know is a blicket.
