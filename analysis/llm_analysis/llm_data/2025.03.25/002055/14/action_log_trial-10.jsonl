The light on the machine is now on.\n\nBased on the information you have gathered, answer the following question: Is object 3 a blicket?\n\nFirst briefly reason and think about the information collected. Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions of the objects with the machine.\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - When object 0 was on the machine, the light was off.\n   - When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - Removing object 2 while object 3 was still on the machine kept the light on, indicating that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turned the light off, suggesting that object 3 is indeed contributing to the machine being on.\n\n3. **Final Tests**:\n   - Object 1 was tested multiple times and did not turn the light on when alone.\n   - Object 2 consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - Object 3 also turned the light on when placed on the machine, and removing it turned the light off.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket because it has a direct influence on the machine's state.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
