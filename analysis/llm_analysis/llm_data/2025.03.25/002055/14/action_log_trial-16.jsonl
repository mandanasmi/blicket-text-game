You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that object 1 may not be a blicket, as it does not seem to affect the machine's state independently.\n3. **Object 2**: The light is off when placed on the machine, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: The light turns on when placed on the machine, and it also remains on when removed. This suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket, as it seems to have a direct influence on the machine's state.\n\nGiven that object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, and the light remains on when it is removed, it indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
