However, it was not tested in isolation to confirm its status definitively. \n   - The light remained on when other objects were present, making it unclear if object 7 is a blicket or if it was the other objects causing the machine to activate.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and lack of definitive isolation testing for object 7, I cannot conclude with certainty that it is a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
