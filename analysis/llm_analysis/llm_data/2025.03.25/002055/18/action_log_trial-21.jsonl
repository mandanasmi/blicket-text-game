Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, we need to analyze the previous interactions with the machine and the objects.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n- Object 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 consistently turned the machine on when placed on it.\n- Object 0 and 5 did not turn the machine on when placed alone, but object 5 did not turn the machine on when it was the only object on the machine.\n\nSince object 7 was able to turn the machine on when placed on it, it suggests that it is likely a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the information collected, I conclude that:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
