When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off.
