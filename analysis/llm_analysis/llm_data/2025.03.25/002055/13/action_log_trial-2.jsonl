You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on as well.\n4. However, when object 0 was placed on the machine, the light was off, indicating that it is not a blicket.\n5. Removing object 1, 2, or 3 from the machine while the others were still on did not turn the light off, suggesting that at least one of them is a blicket.\n6. When object 2 was taken off the machine, the light remained on, indicating that it is likely a blicket.\n\nSince the light turned on with object 2 on the machine and remained on when it was taken off, it suggests that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
