You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light was off. However, when it was removed and then placed back, the light remained off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket. However, we need to consider the interactions with other objects.\n\nSince object 2 is confirmed to be a blicket and the light turned on when object 3 was placed on the machine, it is possible that object 3 is also a blicket. However, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket without further testing it alone or in combination with known non-blickets.\n\nGiven the current evidence, we cannot confirm that object 3 is a blicket based solely on the information we have.
