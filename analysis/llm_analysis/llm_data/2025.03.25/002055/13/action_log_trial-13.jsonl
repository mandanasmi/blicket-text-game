The light on the machine is now on.\n\nBased on the information you have gathered, answer the following question: Is object 3 a blicket?\n\nFirst briefly reason and think about the information collected. Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: The light was on when object 1 was placed on the machine, and it remained on when it was put back on multiple times. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: The light turned on when object 2 was placed on the machine, indicating that it is likely a blicket as well.\n4. **Object 3**: The light turned on when object 3 was placed on the machine, but it also turned off when it was removed. However, it was confirmed to turn on again when placed back on the machine.\n\nSince the light turned on with object 3 on the machine, it indicates that object 3 could be a blicket. However, we need to consider that the light turned off when it was removed, which is consistent with the behavior of other objects that are confirmed to be blickets.\n\nGiven that object 3 turned the light on when placed on the machine, it suggests that it is likely a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
