Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the behavior of the machine in relation to the objects.\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: The same behavior is observed; the light turns on when placed on the machine and turns off when removed. Thus, object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: Similar to the previous objects, the light turns on when placed on the machine and turns off when removed. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket as well.\n4. **Object 3**: The light does not turn on when object 3 is placed on the machine alone, as seen when it was placed on the machine multiple times without affecting the light. However, the light remains on when other objects are present, indicating that object 3 does not contribute to the machine turning on.\n\nSince object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, it cannot be classified as a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
