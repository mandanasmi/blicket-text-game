You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: The light remained on regardless of whether object 1 was on or off the machine. This indicates that object 1 does not affect the machine's state, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but when removed, the light turned off.
