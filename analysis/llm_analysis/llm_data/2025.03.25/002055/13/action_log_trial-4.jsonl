You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.\n2. When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.\n3. When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.\n4. When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light remains off.\n5. Removing object 1, 2, or 3 from the machine does not turn the light off if any of the other objects are still present.\n6. When object 2 is removed from the machine, the light turns off only when it is the last object on the machine.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that:\n- Object 1 and object 3 are definitely blickets since they can turn the machine on by themselves.\n- Object 2 also seems to be a blicket since it can turn the machine on when placed on it, and removing it turns the machine off only when it is the last object.\n\nThus, based on the evidence, object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
