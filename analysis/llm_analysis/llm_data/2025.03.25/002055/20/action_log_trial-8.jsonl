When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 5**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 6**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 6 is also likely a blicket.\n4. **Object 4**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating that object 4 is not a blicket.\n5. **Object 0 and Object 1**: Both were placed on the machine without turning the light on, suggesting they are not blickets.\n6. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating that object 2 is not a blicket.\n7. **Object 7**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but we have not tested it in isolation to see if it can turn the light on by itself.\n\nSince object 7 was only tested in combination with other objects that are known to turn the light on (like object 5), we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket without further testing.\n\nThus, based on the information collected, we cannot confirm that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
