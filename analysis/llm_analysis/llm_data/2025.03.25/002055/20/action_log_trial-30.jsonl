So far, I have observed that the machine's light is on when certain objects are placed on it, but it remains on even when some objects are removed. This suggests that some objects may be blickets while others are not.\n\nI will focus on systematically testing each object to see if the machine's state changes when I manipulate them. Since I have already seen that the machine's light is on with multiple combinations, I will try to isolate the objects that seem to consistently keep the light on.\n\nNext, I will take object 5 off the machine to see if the light turns off, which will help me determine if it is a blicket or not.\n\n> take object 5 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
