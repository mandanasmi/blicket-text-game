However, we need to consider that the light was also on with other objects (5 and 7). \n\nGiven that we have not tested object 6 in isolation (i.e., without other objects that might also be blickets), we cannot definitively conclude that object 6 is a blicket based solely on the information gathered.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
