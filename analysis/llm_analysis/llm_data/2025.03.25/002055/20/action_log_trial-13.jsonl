You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: Similar to object 1, the light turned on when placed on the machine and turned off when removed. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: The same pattern as objects 1 and 2. It is likely a blicket.\n5. **Object 4**: Again, the light turned on when placed and off when removed, indicating it is likely a blicket.\n6. **Object 5**: The same pattern as above, suggesting it is a blicket.\n7. **Object 6**: When placed on the machine, the light was off, indicating it is not a blicket.\n8. **Object 7**: The light turned on when placed on the machine and turned off when removed, indicating that it is likely a blicket.\n\nSince object 7 turned the light on when placed on the machine and turned it off when removed, it follows the same pattern as the other identified blickets (objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
