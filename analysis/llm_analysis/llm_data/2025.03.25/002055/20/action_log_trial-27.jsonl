However, we also need to consider that the light remained on even after removing object 6, which indicates that there are other objects that could also be blickets.\n\nGiven that object 6 was part of the group that turned the machine on, and since it did not turn the machine off when removed, it is reasonable to conclude that object 6 is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
