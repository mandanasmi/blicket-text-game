When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket.\n2. However, when object 3 was taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that it is necessary for the machine to be on.\n3. When object 3 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on again, reinforcing the idea that it is likely a blicket.\n4. The other objects (0, 1, and 2) were tested multiple times, and their behavior was inconsistent with the machine being on or off, especially when object 3 was involved.\n\nGiven that object 3 consistently caused the machine to turn on when placed on it, it is reasonable to conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
