Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the results of the actions taken with the objects on the machine.\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When taken off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but it was also on when object 2 was present. This indicates that object 1 might not be a blicket since the light was still on with other objects.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When taken off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but when taken off, the light turned off. However, it was also on when object 2 was present, which complicates the inference. \n\nSince object 3 was able to turn the light on when placed on the machine, it could potentially be a blicket. However, the light was also on with other combinations, making it less clear.\n\nGiven the evidence, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket, as it did not consistently turn the light on by itself without the influence of other objects.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
