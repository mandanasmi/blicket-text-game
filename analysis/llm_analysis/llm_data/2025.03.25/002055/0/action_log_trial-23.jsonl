Object 3, when placed on the machine, does not turn on the light, and even when it is placed with other objects that do turn on the machine, it does not contribute to the activation.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence collected, object 3 does not activate the machine on its own and does not seem to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
