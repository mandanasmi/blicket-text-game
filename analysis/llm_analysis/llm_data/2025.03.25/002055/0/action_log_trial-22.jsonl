When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n2. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on.\n3. However, when both object 2 and object 3 were placed on the machine together, the light did not turn on, indicating that the combination of these two objects does not activate the machine.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n- Object 2 is definitely a blicket since it alone can activate the machine.\n- Object 3's ability to activate the machine is uncertain because it was only tested in combination with object 2, which is already known to activate the machine.\n\nSince we have not tested object 3 alone without object 2, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket based on the current information.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
