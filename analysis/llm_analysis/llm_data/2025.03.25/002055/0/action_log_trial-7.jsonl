Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the behavior of the machine with the objects.\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on and off when removed.\n2. **Object 1**: The light was off when placed on the machine, and it remained off when removed.\n3. **Object 2**: The light turned on when placed on the machine and turned off when removed.\n4. **Object 3**: The light turned on when placed on the machine and turned off when removed.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- Object 2 is definitely a blicket since it consistently turned the machine on.\n- Object 3 also turned the machine on when placed on it, indicating it could be a blicket.\n- Object 1 did not turn the machine on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nSince object 3 turned the machine on when placed on it, it is reasonable to conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
