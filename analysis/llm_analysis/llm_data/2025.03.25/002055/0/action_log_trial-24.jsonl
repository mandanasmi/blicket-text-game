Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light was off initially. However, after removing object 1 and placing object 3 back on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 may be a blicket, but it was not consistent in turning the light on by itself.\n\nSince object 3 did not turn the light on by itself in previous tests, it is not definitively a blicket. The light only turned on when it was placed on the machine with other objects that are confirmed to be blickets (like object 1).\n\nThus, based on the evidence, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
