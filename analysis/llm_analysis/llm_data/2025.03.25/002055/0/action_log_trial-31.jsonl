This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on at one point, but it was also on when object 2 was present. We need to consider if object 3 can turn the machine on by itself.\n3. **Object 1**: The light turned on when object 1 was placed on the machine, indicating it is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 0**: The light turned on when object 0 was placed on the machine, indicating it is a blicket as well.\n\nNow, we need to check if object 3 can independently activate the machine. The light was off when object 3 was placed alone on the machine after removing other objects. This suggests that object 3 does not activate the machine by itself.\n\nSince object 3 does not independently turn on the machine, we conclude that it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
