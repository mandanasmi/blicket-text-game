You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the results of the actions taken with the objects and the machine.\n\n1. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n2. When object 0, object 1, and object 3 were placed on the machine individually or in combinations without object 2, the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects (0, 1, or 3) can activate the machine on their own.\n3. When object 1 was removed from the machine, the light was off, confirming that object 1 is not a blicket.\n4. Object 3 was also tested in various combinations, and the light did not turn on, indicating that it does not activate the machine either.\n\nSince object 3 did not contribute to turning on the machine in any of the tests, we can conclude that it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
