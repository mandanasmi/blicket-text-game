When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that it has some relationship with the machine.\n2. When object 3 was removed, the light turned off, suggesting that object 3 is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n3. When object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light remained off, indicating that it does not activate the machine.\n4. Object 1 and object 2 also did not activate the machine when placed on it alone.\n\nSince object 3 consistently caused the machine to turn on when it was present, it indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
