This suggests that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 7**: When placed on the machine, the light also turns on, but it was only tested in conjunction with object 5, which we suspect is a blicket. \n3. **Object 4**: The light turns on when placed on the machine, but it was also tested in conjunction with object 5, which complicates the inference.\n4. **Object 6**: The light remained off when tested alone, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n5. **Objects 0, 1, 2, 3**: All were tested and did not turn the light on, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nSince object 7 was only tested in combination with object 5 (which we suspect is a blicket), we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket based solely on the information we have.
