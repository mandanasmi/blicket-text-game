When objects were placed on the machine, the light turned on or off depending on the combination of objects.\n\n2. **Key Findings**:\n   - Object 4 consistently turned the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 5 also turned the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 1 turned the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 6 did not turn the machine on by itself when placed on it, as it was off when it was the only object on the machine.\n   - The machine was on when object 6 was placed on the machine with other objects (like object 4), but it was also on when object 4 was alone, indicating that object 4 is likely the cause of the machine being on in those instances.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since object 6 did not independently turn the machine on and was only associated with the machine being on when combined with other known blickets (like object 4), it suggests that object 6 does not have blicktness.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
