Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'.

However, object 7 does not turn the machine on by itself, as it only activates the machine when object 6 is present. Therefore, object 7 does not have the blicktness required to be classified as a blicket.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
