Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, we need to analyze the information gathered from the interactions with the machine.\n\n1. **Initial Tests**: Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Successful Tests**: When object 5 and object 6 were placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing**: When object 5 was removed, the light turned off, confirming that object 5 is a blicket. The same was true for object 6, as the light turned off when it was removed as well.\n\n4. **Object 7**: When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. However, we have not tested it in isolation to see if it can turn the light on by itself or if it requires the presence of another blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since object 7 turned the light on when placed on the machine, it is possible that it is a blicket. However, without further testing to isolate its effect, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the lack of conclusive evidence that object 7 is a blicket, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
