When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket.\n2. When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This suggests that object 7 could also be a blicket.\n3. However, when both objects 6 and 7 were placed on the machine together, the light remained on, but we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket based solely on this since object 6 is already confirmed to be a blicket.\n4. When object 6 was removed from the machine, the light turned off, indicating that object 6 is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n5. When object 7 was removed from the machine, the light also turned off, but this was after object 6 was already confirmed to be a blicket.\n\nSince we have not tested object 7 alone without object 6, we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket based on the current information.
