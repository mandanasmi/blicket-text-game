This suggests that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**: I will now test combinations of objects to see if the machine turns on with different configurations. Since I suspect object 5 is a blicket, I will try it with other objects to see if they also contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: I will put object 5 on the machine again, along with another object that I haven't tested yet, to see if the machine remains on or turns off.
