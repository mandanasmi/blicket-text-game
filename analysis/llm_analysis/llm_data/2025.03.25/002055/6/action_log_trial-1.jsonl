Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 4**: When placed on the machine, the light does not turn on, indicating that object 4 is not a blicket.\n4. **Object 5**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket.\n5. **Object 6**: When placed on the machine, the light does not turn on, indicating that object 6 is not a blicket.\n6. **Object 7**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on, but it was also observed that when it was taken off, the light remained on. This suggests that object 7 does not independently activate the machine, as the light was already on due to other objects.\n\nSince the light was on when object 7 was placed on the machine, but it was also on due to other objects, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket based on the evidence gathered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
