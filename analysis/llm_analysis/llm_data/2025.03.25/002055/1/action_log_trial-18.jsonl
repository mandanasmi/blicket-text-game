Since object 1 and object 2 both activate the machine independently, they are confirmed to be blickets. \n\nObject 3 also activates the machine, but we have not tested it independently without the other objects. However, since it turned the machine on when placed, it is likely a blicket as well.\n\nThus, based on the information collected, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
