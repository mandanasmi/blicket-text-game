You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. However, when object 1 was placed back on the machine after being removed, the light did not turn on again. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n2. Object 2 also turned the light on when placed on the machine, but it was not tested alone after being removed. However, it was consistently on when placed on the machine.\n3. Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, but the light never turned on when it was the only object on the machine.
