You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Removing object 0 and then object 1 turned the light off, but object 2 alone did not turn the light off when it was put back on the machine.\n3. Object 1 consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine, indicating it is likely a blicket.\n4. Object 3's behavior was inconsistent; it turned the light on and off depending on the presence of other objects.\n5. Object 2 was able to keep the light on when placed on the machine after removing other objects, suggesting it may also be a blicket.\n\nGiven that object 2 was able to keep the light on when placed on the machine, it is reasonable to conclude that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
