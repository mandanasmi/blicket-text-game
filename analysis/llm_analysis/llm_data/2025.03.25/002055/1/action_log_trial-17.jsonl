This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off, both when it was placed alone and when it was placed with other objects (like object 1). \n\nSince object 3 did not cause the machine to turn on in any of the tests, we can conclude that it does not have blicktness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
