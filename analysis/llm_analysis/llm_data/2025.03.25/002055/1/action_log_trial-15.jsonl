You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 2**: Similar to object 1, placing it on the machine turned the light on, and removing it turned the light off. Thus, object 2 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light did not turn on when it was the only object present. However, when it was placed on the machine with object 0, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 does not independently activate the machine, but it may work in conjunction with other objects.\n4. **Object 0**: The light turned on when object 0 was placed on the machine, and it consistently turned on when it was present with other objects. This indicates that object 0 is also a blicket.\n\nSince object 3 did not activate the machine on its own and only contributed to the light being on when combined with other objects, we can conclude that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
