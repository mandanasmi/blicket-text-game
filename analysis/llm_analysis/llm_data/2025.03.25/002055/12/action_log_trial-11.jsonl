When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.\n2. When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on.\n3. When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light is off, but when it is removed, the light remains on with other objects.\n4. Object 0 also turns the light on when placed on the machine.\n\nFrom the interactions, we see that:\n- Object 1, object 2, and object 0 consistently turn the machine on when placed on it.\n- Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself.\n\nSince object 2 turns the machine on when placed on it, it indicates that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
