Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we can analyze the results of the actions taken with the objects on the machine.\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but we have not tested it in isolation. However, when all objects were removed from the machine, the light remained off, indicating that none of the objects can be a blicket if they are not present.\n\nSince object 3 was never tested alone and the light turned on when it was placed on the machine, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket without further testing. However, since the other three objects are confirmed blickets, it is likely that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the information gathered, I conclude that:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
