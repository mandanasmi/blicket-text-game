Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we can analyze the results of the actions taken with the objects and the machine.\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When taken off, the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When taken off, the light turns off. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light does not turn on. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. However, when taken off, the light remains on, indicating that the machine is still activated by either object 0 or object 1, which are both confirmed to be blickets.\n\nSince object 3 can turn the machine on when placed on it, it is possible that it is a blicket. However, the fact that the light remains on after removing it suggests that it may not be necessary for the machine to stay on, as the other objects (0 and 1) are already confirmed to be blickets.\n\nThus, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket based solely on the information gathered, as it could be that the machine is still on due to the presence of other blickets.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
