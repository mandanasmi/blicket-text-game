When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light was off.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n4. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n\nNext, we removed each object one by one:\n- Removing object 0 kept the light on.\n- Removing object 1 turned the light off.\n- Removing object 2 turned the light off.\n- Removing object 3 turned the light off.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- Object 1 and object 2 are definitely blickets since their removal turned the light off.\n- Object 0 is not a blicket since it did not turn the light on when placed on the machine.\n- Object 3 is also a candidate for being a blicket since it turned the light on when placed on the machine, but we need to consider its removal. When object 3 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that it is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
