When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on as well.\n4. Object 2, when placed on the machine, did not turn the light on.\n5. Removing object 3 from the machine turned the light off, indicating that it is likely a blicket since the machine was off without it.\n6. Object 0 and object 1 consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine, while object 2 did not.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 3 must be a blicket because it is necessary for the machine to turn on when it is placed on the machine, as evidenced by the light turning off when it was removed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
