Object 0 was placed on the machine multiple times, and the light was off when it was the only object present, indicating that it is not a blicket.\n3. Object 3 was placed on the machine and the light turned on, but it was also on the machine when other objects were present, making it difficult to isolate its effect.\n4. When object 3 was taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that it is likely a blicket since the machine was off without it.\n\nGiven that the light turned off when object 3 was removed, it suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
