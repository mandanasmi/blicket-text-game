Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light was off when it was the only object. However, when combined with other objects (like object 1), the light was on. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket by itself.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. However, when removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nSince object 3 turned the light on when placed on the machine and turned it off when removed, it behaves like a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
