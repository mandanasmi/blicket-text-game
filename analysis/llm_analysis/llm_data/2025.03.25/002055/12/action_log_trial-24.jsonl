Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the behavior of the machine in relation to the objects.\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: The same behavior is observed; the light turns on when placed on the machine and off when removed. Thus, object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: Similar to the previous objects, the light turns on when placed on the machine and off when removed. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket as well.\n4. **Object 3**: The light remains on regardless of whether object 3 is on the machine or not. This indicates that object 3 does not affect the machine's state, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nSince object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on or off when manipulated, it is reasonable to conclude that it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
