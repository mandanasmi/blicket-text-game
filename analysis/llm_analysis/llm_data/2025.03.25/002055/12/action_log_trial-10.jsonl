Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we can analyze the results of the actions taken with the objects on the machine.\n\n1. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 2 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. However, we have not tested it alone without other objects. We need to consider the interactions.\n4. **Object 0**: The light remains on regardless of whether object 0 is on or off the machine, suggesting it does not affect the machine's state.\n\nSince object 3 turned the light on when placed on the machine, it is likely a blicket. However, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket without further testing it alone or in combination with known non-blickets.\n\nGiven the information, we can conclude that object 3 is likely a blicket, but we cannot be 100% certain without additional tests.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
