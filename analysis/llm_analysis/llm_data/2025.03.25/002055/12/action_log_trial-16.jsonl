You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that object 2 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. However, when it was removed, the light turned off only when all other objects (1 and 2) were also removed. This suggests that object 3 might not be a blicket since it does not independently cause the machine to turn on when the other blickets are not present.\n4. **Object 0**: The interactions with object 0 were limited, but it was placed on the machine and did not turn the light on independently.\n\nFrom the above reasoning, we can conclude that object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, as it was only on the machine when other known blickets (objects 1 and 2) were also present.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
