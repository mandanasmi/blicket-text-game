You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When it is taken off, the light turns off, indicating that object 1 is a blicket.\n- Object 2 also keeps the light on when placed on the machine, suggesting it is a blicket as well.\n- Object 3, when placed on the machine, turns the light on, but when taken off, the light turns off, indicating it is a blicket.\n- Object 4 behaves similarly, keeping the light on when placed on the machine and turning it off when removed, indicating it is a blicket.\n- Object 5 also keeps the light on when placed on the machine, indicating it is a blicket.\n- Object 6 keeps the light on when placed on the machine, indicating it is a blicket.\n- Object 0 does not turn the light on by itself, but when combined with other objects, it does not affect the light status negatively.\n- Object 7 was placed on the machine multiple times, and the light was on when it was there, but it was never tested alone to see if it could turn the light on by itself.\n\nSince we have not tested object 7 alone and it was only seen in conjunction with other objects that are confirmed to be blickets, we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the information collected, we cannot confirm that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
