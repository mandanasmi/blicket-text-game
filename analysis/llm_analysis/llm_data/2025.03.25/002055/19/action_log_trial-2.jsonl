When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. When objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were placed on the machine, the light turned on, suggesting that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n3. Object 1 was repeatedly placed on the machine and the light was consistently on, indicating that it is likely a blicket.\n4. Object 7 was placed on the machine and the light turned on, but when it was taken off, the light turned off, suggesting that object 7 is also a blicket.\n5. However, when object 1 was taken off the machine, the light remained on, indicating that the machine can still be activated by other objects.\n\nSince object 7 turned the machine on when placed on it, it suggests that it has blicktness.
