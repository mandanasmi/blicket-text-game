However, we have not tested it in isolation to confirm its status definitively.\n   - Given that the light was on when object 6 was on the machine, it is likely that object 6 is a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 6 is likely a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
