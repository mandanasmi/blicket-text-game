It was on the machine multiple times without changing the light status.\n4. **Object 4**: The light turned on when placed on the machine and remained on when it was placed again. Removing it did not turn the light off, indicating that it might not be a blicket, but it could also be that other objects are keeping the light on.\n5. **Object 5**: The light turned on when placed on the machine, suggesting it is a blicket.\n6. **Object 6**: The light turned on when placed on the machine, suggesting it is a blicket.\n7. **Object 7**: The light turned on when placed on the machine, but it also remained on when removed, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n\nFrom this analysis, object 4 turned the light on when placed on the machine, but it was also on the machine with other objects that could be blickets.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, we need to analyze the results of the actions taken with the objects on the machine.\n\n1. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 2**: Similar to object 1, the light turned on when placed on the machine and turned off when removed. Thus, object 2 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 3**: The light remained on when object 3 was placed on the machine, but it was never tested alone. However, it was on the machine multiple times without affecting the light status when other objects were removed. This suggests that object 3 might not be a blicket.\n4. **Object 4**: The light turned on when placed on the machine and remained on when it was removed. This indicates that object 4 is a blicket.\n5. **Object 5**: The light turned on when placed on the machine and remained on when removed. Thus, object 5 is a blicket.\n6. **Object 6**: The light turned on when placed on the machine and remained on when removed. Thus, object 6 is a blicket.\n7. **Object 7**: The light turned on when placed on the machine, but it was also on when other objects were present. When removed, the light remained on, indicating that it does not independently cause the light to turn on. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 does not independently activate the machine, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
