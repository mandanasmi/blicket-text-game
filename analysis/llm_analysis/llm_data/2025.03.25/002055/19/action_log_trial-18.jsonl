You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. However, when it was taken off, the light turned off, indicating that object 7 does not have blicktness on its own.\n2. The other objects (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) were tested, and the light turned on with them, suggesting that at least some of them are blickets.\n3. The light turned off when object 7 was taken off the machine, which means it does not contribute to the machine turning on.\n\nSince object 7 does not activate the machine on its own and does not seem to have any blicktness, we conclude that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
