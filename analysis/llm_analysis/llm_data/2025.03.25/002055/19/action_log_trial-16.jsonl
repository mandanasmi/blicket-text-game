You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When object 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 2 were placed on the machine, the light turned on. \n2. When object 5 and 6 were taken off, the light turned off, indicating that at least one of them is a blicket.\n3. Object 5 consistently turned the machine on when placed back, suggesting it is a blicket.\n4. Object 6 also turned the machine on when placed, indicating it is likely a blicket as well.\n5. Object 2 was initially on the machine but did not affect the light when taken off, suggesting it may not be a blicket.\n6. Object 7 has not been tested directly, and since the light was off when it was the only object on the machine, we cannot conclude its status.\n\nSince we have no direct evidence that object 7 is a blicket, and it has not been tested, we cannot confirm it is a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
