This indicates that they are likely blickets.\n\n4. **Object 3**: \n   - When placed on the machine, it turned on, but when it was taken off, the machine turned off. This suggests that Object 3 is also a blicket.\n\n5. **Object 2**: \n   - Similar to the others, it turned the machine on and off when removed, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n6. **Object 0 and Object 1**: \n   - Neither of these objects turned the machine on, indicating they are not blickets.\n\n7. **Object 7**: \n   - Since it did not turn the machine on when placed on it, it suggests that Object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we conclude that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
