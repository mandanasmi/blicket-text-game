The machine is off, and there are four objects here. Objects 0, 1, and 3 are on the floor, while object 2 is already on the machine. The machine's light is off, so maybe object 2 isn't a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one blicket.\n\nFirst, maybe I should check what happens when I remove object 2. If the machine was supposed to turn on with just a blicket, but it's off even with object 2 on it, perhaps object 2 isn't a blicket. Or maybe the rule is different. Let me try taking object 2 off the machine to see if that changes anything. \n\nWait, if I take object 2 off and the machine remains off, that doesn't tell me much. Alternatively, maybe putting another object on the machine with object 2 might activate it. But since the machine is currently off with object 2 alone, maybe object 2 isn't a blicket. Let's test that. \n\nSo, first step: take object 2 off the machine. Then, see if the machine's state changes. But the machine is already off, so maybe removing it won't do anything. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe putting another object on the machine. Let's try adding object 0 to the machine. But first, maybe check if the machine turns on with just object 0. So, take object 2 off, then put object 0 on. Wait, but that uses two steps. Alternatively, maybe leave object 2 on and add another object. Let me think.\n\nWait, the machine is currently off with object 2 on it. So, if the rule is that a single blicket activates it, then object 2 is not a blicket. But maybe the rule requires two blickets. So, maybe adding another blicket to the machine would turn it on. Let's try adding object 0 to the machine. So, command: put object 0 on machine. Then check the machine's state. If the light turns on, then either object 0 is a blicket, or both 0 and 2 are. Wait, but if object 2 isn't a blicket and 0 is, then the machine would turn on. If object 2 is a blicket and 0 is also a blicket, then the machine turns on. Alternatively, if the rule is that any single blicket will activate it, then putting object 0 on might help. But since the machine was off with object 2 alone, maybe 2 isn't a blicket. Let's try that. So, first, put object 0 on the machine. Then see if the machine turns on. If it does, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe need to combine with others. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that only even-numbered objects are blickets. But that's just a guess. Let's start testing.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to start by removing object 2 and testing each object one by one. Let me try that. So, first take object 2 off the machine. Then put object 0 on. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. Then take 0 off, put 1 on, and so on. But that might take more steps. Alternatively, maybe test combinations. For example, put object 0 and object 1 on the machine together. Let's see. But first, let's check each object individually. Since the initial state has object 2 on the machine and the machine is off, maybe object 2 is not a blicket. Let's remove it first. So, first command: take object 2 off the machine. Then, the machine is empty. Then, put object 0 on. Check if the machine turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, remove it and try the next. Let's proceed.\n\nSo first step: take object 2 off the machine. Then, put object 0 on the machine. If that doesn't work, then try object 1, then 3. But each of these would take steps. Alternatively, maybe the rule requires two blickets. Let's try combinations. For example, after removing 2, put 0 and 1 on. But that would require two steps. Let me outline possible steps:\n\n1. take object 2 off. Now machine is empty. Machine is off. So 2 alone wasn't doing anything.\n\n2. put object 0 on machine. Check if it turns on. If yes, 0 is a blicket. If not, remove 0.\n\n3. put object 1 on machine. Check.\n\n4. put object 3 on machine. Check.\n\nIf none activate alone, then maybe the rule is that two or more blickets are needed. Then try combinations.\n\nBut let's start with step 1: take object 2 off. Then step 2: put 0 on. Let's see what happens."}

So maybe object 3 is a blicket, and the others aren't. But why didn't the machine activate when I put 3 alone? Wait, maybe the initial state had object 2 on the machine, and the light was off. Then taking 2 off and putting 0, 1, 3... but when I put 3 on, the machine turned on. Wait, but after putting 0, 1, and 3 on, the machine is on. So maybe the presence of object 3 is necessary.

But why didn't it turn on when object 2 was initially on the machine? Because 2 isn't a blicket. So maybe 3 is the only blicket. But to confirm, I should test putting 3 alone on the machine.\n\nWait, but in the current state, objects 0,1,3 are on the machine, and the light is on. If I take 0 and 1 off, leaving just 3, does the light stay on? Because the previous steps were: after placing 3, the light turned on. But if I take 0 and 1 off, leaving only 3, does the light stay on? The problem is that the steps taken so far don't include that. So perhaps I need to test that scenario. Let's see: the current machine has 0,1,3 on it. The light is on. If I take 0 and 1 off, maybe the light turns off. That would suggest that the presence of 3 alone isn't enough. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are present. So if there are multiple blickets, they all need to be on the machine. For example, if objects 0,1,3 are all blickets, then putting all three on would activate it. But that's not the case here, since putting them one by one didn't activate until the third. Wait, when I put 0 on, nothing. Then 1, still nothing. Then 3, and it activates. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but only object 3 is a blicket. But why didn't it activate when 3 was added? Wait, when you put 3 on the machine, the light turns on. But in the step-by-step, the commands were:\n\n- take object 2 off: light off.\n\n- put 0 on: light off.\n\n- put 1 on: light off.\n\n- put 3 on: light on.\n\nSo after putting 3 on, the machine turns on. So with objects 0,1,3 on the machine, the light is on. So perhaps the presence of 3 is necessary. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present, and 3 is a blicket. But why didn't it activate when 3 was put on alone? Wait, no. Because in the steps taken, when I put 0 on, then 1, then 3. So when I put 3 on, the machine's state changed to on. So maybe the machine's activation is triggered by the presence of 3. But then, if I take 0 and 1 off, leaving only 3, does it stay on? The problem is that I haven't tested that yet. So perhaps the next step is to remove objects 0 and 1 to see if the machine remains on. If it does, then 3 is the blicket and the rule is that having at least one blicket on the machine. If it turns off, then the rule might require multiple blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the sum of weights or some other property is met. But given the information, it's more likely a logical combination. Let's try to test that.\n\nSo current state: objects 0,1,3 are on the machine. Light is on. Let's take 0 and 1 off. So take object 0 off, take object 1 off. Then check if the machine remains on. But I have to do this step by step. Let's say I take object 0 off. The light might stay on or turn off. Then take object 1 off. If the light stays on after removing 0, then object 3 is the only blicket. If removing 0 turns it off, then maybe 0 is a blicket, but that conflicts with previous steps. Wait, but when I put 0 on alone, the light didn't turn on. So that suggests 0 isn't a blicket. Similarly for 1. But when 3 was added, the light turned on. So perhaps 3 is a blicket, and the presence of any blicket activates the machine. But why didn't the machine activate when 3 was placed? Wait, in the steps, after adding 3, the machine turned on. So maybe when 3 is on the machine, regardless of other objects, the machine is on. So the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present, and 3 is a blicket. But why didn't the initial state with object 2 on the machine turn it on? Because 2 isn't a blicket.\n\nSo possible conclusions: blickets are 3. The rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. But need to confirm by testing. So next step: take object 0 and 1 off the machine, leaving only 3. If the light stays on, then 3 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the rule is more complex. Let's do that.\n\nSo the next command would be to take object 0 off the machine. Let me try that."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Let's start by reviewing the steps I've taken so far and the results.\n\nInitially, the setup was: objects 0,1,3 on the floor, and object 2 on the machine. The machine was off. Then I took object 2 off, leaving the machine empty. Then I added objects 0,1,3 one by one. After adding all three, the machine turned on. But when I removed object 0, it turned off again. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. When I put object 0 on the machine, nothing happened. Then added object 1, still off. Then added object 3, and the machine turned on. So with 0,1,3 on the machine, it's on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. That suggests that when object 0 is removed, even if 1 and 3 are still there, the machine turns off. So maybe object 0 is a blicket? But wait, when I first put 0 on alone, it didn't activate. Then adding 1 and 3 made it turn on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So maybe the presence of 0,1,3 together is required? Or maybe 0 and 3? Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on it. So if 0,3 are blickets, but when I put 0 and 3 on, maybe with 1, but when I remove 0, then one blicket is missing. But earlier, when I had only 0 on, the machine didn't activate. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if exactly three objects are on it. But when I had 0,1,3 (three objects), the machine turned on. Then when I removed 0, leaving two objects (1 and 3), it turned off. But that could be a coincidence. Let's test that. Maybe try putting three objects again. Wait, but the initial state had object 2 on the machine, and the machine was off. So with only object 2, which was on the machine initially, the machine was off. Then when I took 2 off, added 0,1,3, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 3) turned it off. So the number of objects might not be the rule. Because three objects (0,1,3) activated, but maybe 2 is not a blicket. Wait, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If there are two blickets, say 0 and 3, then when both are on, the machine activates. But when I first put 0 on alone, nothing. Then adding 1 (non-blicket) and 3 (blicket) would make both 0 and 3 on, so machine on. Then removing 0 (a blicket) leaves 3 (blicket) and 1 (non), so not all blickets are on, so machine off. That could make sense. But wait, if the rule is that all blickets must be present, then the blickets would have to be 0,1,3, but that's not possible because when I put all three on, the machine was on, but when 0 was removed, it turned off. Wait, but if the blickets are 0,3, then the rule could be that all blickets must be present. So when both 0 and 3 are on the machine, regardless of others, the machine activates. Let's see: when I added 0, nothing. Then 1, nothing. Then 3, which would add the second blicket (0 and 3), so machine turns on. Then removing 0 (one blicket left), so machine turns off. That fits. So the rule might be that all blickets must be on the machine. So in this case, the blickets are 0 and 3. But wait, when I added 0,1,3, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 caused it to turn off. But if the blickets are 0 and 3, then having both on would trigger the machine, and removing either would turn it off. So that seems possible.\n\nBut how do I confirm this? Let's think. If I put 0 and 3 on the machine, without 1, does the machine turn on? Let's try that. So first, take off all objects. Then put 0 on. Machine off. Then put 3 on. If the rule is that all blickets must be on, and 0 and 3 are blickets, then putting both should activate the machine. So in this case, after adding 0 and 3, the machine should turn on. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my previous steps, after taking 2 off, I added 0,1,3. The machine turned on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So the presence of 0 and 3 together (plus 1) made it on. But maybe 1 is also a blicket. Wait, but when I added 0, then 1, then 3, the machine only turned on when 3 was added. So perhaps 3 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is present. But that doesn't fit because when I had only 3 on the machine, maybe not. Wait, let's check again.\n\nWait, in the initial state, object 2 was on the machine, and the machine was off. Then I took 2 off. Then put 0 on: machine off. Then put 1 on: machine off. Then put 3 on: machine on. So when adding 3 to 0 and 1, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 3) turned it off. Hmm. So the machine turned on when 0,1,3 were on, but off when only 1 and 3. So maybe the rule is that the sum of some property (like weight) of the objects on the machine meets a threshold. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present. But I need more data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are on it. Suppose 3 is a blicket, and 0 is not. Wait, when I added 3, but 0 and 1 were already on. If 3 is the only blicket, then the machine would activate when 3 is added, regardless of others. But then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 3) would still have 3 on, so machine should stay on. But in the previous step, removing 0 made the machine turn off. So that doesn't fit. So maybe 0 and 3 are both blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. So when both are on the machine, the machine turns on. But then, when I put 0 on first, then 1, then 3, the machine turns on when 3 is added. Then, removing 0 (a blicket) causes the machine to turn off. That would fit if the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present. But what if I put 0 and 3 on without 1? Let me try that. So I need to test putting 0 and 3 on the machine. Let's see. Currently, after the last step, the machine has objects 1,3 on it. The light is off. So I can take 1 and 3 off, then put 0 and 3 on. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, take object 1 off. Then take object 3 off. Then put object 0 on. Then put object 3 on. If the machine turns on, that would confirm that 0 and 3 are the blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. If the machine doesn't turn on, then maybe there's another rule.\n\nBut how many steps do I have left? Let's see. The initial steps were:\n\n1. take 2 off\n2. put 0 on\n3. put 1 on\n4. put 3 on\n5. take 0 off\n\nSo that's 5 steps. Now, the next commands would be step 6 onwards. Let's proceed.\n\nSo next command: take object 1 off the machine. Then take object 3 off. Then put 0 on, then 3 on. Let's simulate:\n\nAfter taking 1 off, the machine has 3. Then taking 3 off, machine is empty. Put 0 on: machine off. Then put 3 on: machine turns on. That would confirm that 0 and 3 together activate the machine. So the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be on. But wait, when I first put 0 on alone, machine off. Then add 1 (non-blicket), still off. Then add 3 (blicket), machine on. Then remove 0, leaving 1 and 3: machine off. So that fits. So the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present. So they are the blickets. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when 0 and 3 are present, regardless of others. But in the previous step, when 0,1,3 were on, the machine was on, and removing 0 made it off. So even if other objects are present, as long as both 0 and 3 are there, it's on. So putting 0 and 3 alone should activate the machine. Let's test that.\n\nSo the next step would be to take object 1 off the machine. But currently, after the last step, the machine has objects 1 and 3. The light is off. Wait, the last step was taking 0 off, which left 1 and 3 on the machine, and the light turned off. So the machine is now off with 1 and 3 on it. So to test if 0 and 3 together activate it, I need to remove 1 and 3, then add 0 and 3 again.\n\nSo, the commands would be:\n\n> take object 1 off the machine\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 3 off the machine\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nThen:\n\n> put object 3 on the machine\n\nIf the machine turns on after putting 3 on, then that confirms that 0 and 3 are the blickets and the rule is that both must be present. Let's proceed with these steps.\n\nBut since each command is a single step, I need to do them one by one. Let's start with taking 1 off.\n\nAfter taking 1 off, the machine has object 3. The light is still off. Then taking 3 off, machine is empty. Then putting 0 on: machine off. Then putting 3 on: machine turns on. So that would confirm the rule. So after these steps, the machine would be on with 0 and 3 on it. Then, if I remove 3, the machine should turn off. Let's see.\n\nBut let's go step by step. Let's first take object 1 off. Then take object 3 off. Then put 0 on. Then put 3 on. Let's see the results.\n\nBut in the current state, after the last command (take object 0 off), the machine has objects 1 and 3 on it, and the light is off. So next step: take object 1 off. That leaves object 3 on the machine. Then take object 3 off. Now machine is empty. Put 0 on: machine off. Then put 3 on: machine turns on. So that would confirm that 0 and 3 together activate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. But if only 0 and 3 are blickets, then two blickets would activate it. But when I had 0 and 3 on the machine, that's two, so machine on. If that's the case, then putting either 0 or 3 alone wouldn't activate it, but both would. So that fits.\n\nBut how do I know if there are more blickets? For example, maybe object 1 is also a blicket. Let's test that. Suppose I put 1 and 3 on the machine. If the machine doesn't turn on, then 1 is not a blicket. But in the previous step, when I had 1 and 3 on the machine (after removing 0), the machine was off. So that suggests that 1 is not a blicket. So likely, the blickets are 0 and 3, and the rule is that both must be present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. If 0,3 are blickets, then having both on would activate. If there are three blickets, but that's not the case here. Let's see.\n\nAnother possibility: the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present, but only when another condition is met. For example, the sum of their positions, or something. But that's more complex. The simplest explanation is that both 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. So I should test that.\n\nBut perhaps I can also test if object 2 is a blicket. Initially, object 2 was on the machine, and the machine was off. So if 2 is a blicket, then having it alone on the machine should activate it. But it was off. So 2 is not a blicket. So that's ruled out.\n\nSo possible blickets are 0,3. Rule: both must be on the machine.\n\nBut to confirm, let's try putting 0 and 3 on the machine without any others. So after clearing the machine, put 0 and 3. If the machine turns on, then that's the case.\n\nSo the next steps would be:\n\n1. Take object 1 off the machine. (Current machine has 1 and 3)\nAfter this, machine has 3. Light is off.\n\n2. Take object 3 off. Machine is empty.\n\n3. Put object 0 on the machine. Machine off.\n\n4. Put object 3 on the machine. Machine turns on.\n\nIf step 4 results in the machine turning on, then the rule is confirmed.\n\nSo I need to perform these steps. Let's proceed with the first command: take object 1 off the machine."}

So the machine turns on when certain objects (blickets) are placed on it. The goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine activate.\n\nFirst, when I started, the initial state was object 2 on the machine, and the light was off. Then I took object 2 off, and the light stayed off. Then I put objects 0, 1, and 3 on the machine one by one. After putting all three (0,1,3), the machine turned on. But when I removed objects 0 and 1, leaving only 3 on the machine, the light turned off. Wait, no\u2014when I put 0,1,3 on, the light came on. Then taking off 0 and 1 left 3 on the machine, but the light went off. So that suggests that object 3 alone isn't enough. But when all three (0,1,3) were on, it worked. Wait, but when I put them on one by one, the light only came on when I added object 3. Let me check the steps again:\n\n- After taking 2 off, machine is off.\n- Put 0 on: still off.\n- Put 1 on (now 0 and 1 are on machine): still off.\n- Put 3 on (now 0,1,3 on machine): light turns on.\n- Then take 0 and 1 off, leaving 3: light off.\n\nSo when 0,1,3 are all on, it works. But when only 3 is on, it doesn't. So perhaps the rule requires all three of 0,1,3 to be on? But wait, maybe there's another rule. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets, and 3 is a blicket but 0 and 1 are not. Wait, but when I had 0 and 1 on the machine (without 3), the light was off. Then adding 3 turned it on. So maybe object 3 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. But that can't be because when 3 was on alone, it didn't work. Wait, but when I added 3 to 0 and 1, the light came on. So maybe the rule is that the presence of object 3 plus at least two other objects? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when exactly three objects are placed on it, regardless of which ones. Let's test that.\n\nWait, initially, object 2 was on the machine (alone), and the light was off. So with one object, it didn't activate. Then when I had three objects (0,1,3) on, it activated. Then removing two left one (3), and it turned off. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when three or more objects are on it. But when I had 0,1,3 (three objects), it turned on. But when I had 0 and 1 (two objects), it was off. So that might fit. Let me think: if the machine activates when three or more objects are placed, then that would explain the observations. But the initial state had object 2 alone (count 1) and the machine was off. Then after adding three objects (0,1,3) making total three, it turned on. Then removing two (0 and 1), leaving 3 (count 1) turned it off. So that would suggest the rule is \"the machine activates when three or more objects are on it.\" But that would mean that any three objects would work. But maybe the blickets are the ones that actually count towards the total. Wait, but the problem states that blickets make the machine turn on following some hidden rule. So maybe the rule is about the number of blickets. For example, maybe the machine requires at least two blickets, and object 3 is a blicket. Let's see: when I had 0,1,3 on, maybe 3 is a blicket, but 0 and 1 are not. Then if the rule is \"at least one blicket,\" then when 3 is on, it should activate. But when 3 was alone, it didn't. So that's not possible. Alternatively, if the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. Then perhaps in the scenario where 0,1,3 are on, maybe two of them are blickets. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. When I put 0,1,3 on, the machine turns on. So that could mean that two of them are blickets. Then when I take off 0 and 1, leaving 3 (if 3 is a blicket), then the machine would have only one blicket, so it turns off. But how do I know which ones are the blickets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of the blickets' weights (assuming each has a weight) must exceed a threshold, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when all blickets are on it. So if there are three blickets, and all three are on the machine, then it activates. But in this case, when 0,1,3 are on, the machine activates. Then when 0 and 1 are removed, leaving 3, it deactivates. So if all three are blickets, then the machine would require all of them to be on. But in that case, when you have all three on, it activates. If any is removed, it deactivates. But in the initial state, object 2 was on the machine. So if object 2 is not a blicket, and the machine requires all blickets to be on, then when 0,1,3 are on (assuming they are all blickets), the machine would activate. But initially, object 2 was on, but the machine was off. So that would fit if 2 is not a blicket. But when I took 2 off and put 0,1,3 on, the machine turned on. Then if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then 0,1,3 are the blickets. But when I put them on, they are all on, so machine on. When I remove any, machine off. But when I took off 0 and 1, leaving 3, the machine turned off. So that fits. But how to confirm? Let's test.\n\nBut I need to plan the next steps. So far, I have that when 0,1,3 are on, the machine is on. When only 3 is on, it's off. If I put 3 on alone, does it stay off? Let's check the previous steps. Yes, when I put 3 on after 0 and 1, the light turned on. So when all three are on, it's on. If I then remove 0 and 1, leaving 3, it's off. So that suggests that 3 alone isn't enough. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all three are present. Then 0,1,3 are blickets. But what if the rule is different. Maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets. Let's see: in the case where 0,1,3 are on, maybe two of them are blickets (even), and when three are on, maybe it's odd. But this seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. But when 3 is alone, it's off, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that all objects on it are blickets. So if you have any non-blicket on the machine, it doesn't activate. So if 0 and 1 are non-blickets, and 3 is a blicket, then putting all three on would mean there are non-blickets (0,1) on the machine, so it doesn't activate. But in the previous steps, when I put 0,1,3 on, the machine activated. So that contradicts that rule.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of possible rules based on the observations:\n\nObservation 1: Initially, object 2 is on the machine. Machine is off. So 2 is not a blicket, or the rule isn't satisfied with just 2.\n\nObservation 2: After removing 2, putting 0,1,3 on the machine: machine turns on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving 3) turns it off. So machine is on when 0,1,3 are on, off when only 3 is on.\n\nPossible rules:\n\n1. The machine activates when all three (0,1,3) are on. So they are all blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be present.\n\nBut in that case, the initial state (object 2 on) wouldn't have any blickets (since 0,1,3 are on the floor). So the machine is off, which matches. Then when we put all three on, machine on. But if the rule is that all blickets must be on, then the blickets are 0,1,3. But when we took off 0 and 1, leaving 3, the machine turns off, which fits because not all blickets are present.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's test if putting two of them on would work. For example, put 0 and 3 on. If the machine stays off, then the rule would require all three. But in the previous steps, when we had 0 and 1 on (before adding 3), the machine was off. Then adding 3 turned it on. So that suggests that all three are needed. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when all blickets (which are 0,1,3) are on it. But that would mean that the blickets are 0,1,3, and the rule is all of them must be present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine activates when at least three objects are on, regardless of which ones. But in the initial state, object 2 was on alone (count 1) and machine off. When I added 0,1,3 (total 3), machine on. Then removing two (leaving 1) machine off. So that would fit the rule of \"exactly three objects on the machine\". But then why would the machine turn on when three are on, regardless of their identity. But the problem states that blickets are the ones that make the machine turn on. So that suggests that the rule is based on the presence of blickets, not the count of objects.\n\nSo perhaps the machine requires a specific combination. Let's consider another possibility. Maybe the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. Suppose 1 and 3 are blickets. Then when 0,1,3 are on, there are two blickets (1 and 3). But when 3 is alone, it's one blicket. Then the machine would turn on when two are present. But in that case, if I put objects 1 and 3 on the machine, the machine should activate. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nIn the current state, after the previous commands, objects 0 and 1 are off the machine, 3 is on. The light is off. So to test this, I could take 3 off, then put 1 and 3 on. Let's see:\n\nTake 3 off (machine is empty). Then put 1 on: machine off. Then put 3 on: now 1 and 3 are on. If the rule is exactly two blickets, and 1 and 3 are blickets, then machine should turn on. But according to previous steps, when 0,1,3 were on, the machine turned on. But when 1 and 3 are on, would it? I need to test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires the presence of object 3. So 3 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when 3 is present along with any other object. So when 3 is alone, it's off, but when 3 is with 0 and 1, it's on. But in that case, putting 3 and 1 on should turn it on. Let's check:\n\nCurrent state: object 3 is on the machine, light is off. So if I put 1 on, the machine would have 1 and 3. If that's enough (if the rule is \"3 and at least one other\"), then it should turn on. But in the previous step, when I had 0 and 1 on, then added 3, the light turned on. So maybe the rule is that 3 must be present along with any other object. Let's test that.\n\nBut how? The current state is that 3 is on the machine, and the light is off. So if I add object 1, the machine would have 3 and 1. If the light turns on, that supports the rule that 3 plus any other. If not, then another possibility.\n\nSo the next step could be to put object 1 on the machine again. Let's try that.\n\nWait, but I need to output a command. Let me think of the possible next steps to test hypotheses.\n\nHypothesis 1: All three (0,1,3) are blickets, and the machine requires all to be present.\n\nTo test this, if I put 0 and 1 back on the machine (along with 3), the machine should turn on. Let's check. Currently, 3 is on the machine. If I put 0 and 1 on, making all three, then the machine should turn on. Then remove one (say 0), and see if it turns off. That would support the hypothesis.\n\nHypothesis 2: The machine requires exactly two blickets, which are 1 and 3. Then putting 1 and 3 on should activate it.\n\nTo test, take 3 off (since currently 3 is on and machine is off), then put 1 and 3 on. If the machine turns on, that supports this.\n\nBut given the previous steps, when 0,1,3 were on, the machine turned on. But when only 3 is on, it's off. So perhaps the rule is that 3 must be present along with at least one other. So 3 is a blicket, and another blicket. Wait, but in that case, if 3 and 1 are blickets, then putting 1 and 3 on should activate the machine. Let's see.\n\nCurrent state: machine has 3. Light is off. If I put 1 on, now machine has 1 and 3. If that's two blickets, and the rule is at least two, then light should turn on. But in the previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. Then adding 3 made it on. So 0 and 1 are not blickets, but 3 is. But in that case, when 3 is on with others, it's on. But that doesn't explain why adding 3 to 0 and 1 (non-blickets) would make it turn on. So that suggests that the presence of 3 (a blicket) along with any two objects (non-blickets) triggers the machine. But the rule could be that the machine activates when there's exactly one blicket (3) and two or more objects. That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present. If 3 is the only blicket, then when it's alone (1 blicket, odd), the machine would be on. But in the current state, 3 is alone and the machine is off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to outline possible experiments:\n\n1. Put object 3 on the machine alone. If it activates, then 3 is a blicket and the rule is \"at least one blicket\". But from previous steps, when 3 was added to 0 and 1 (non-blickets), the machine turned on, but when 3 was alone, it was off. Wait, no: when I took object 2 off, then put 0 on (machine has 0), then 1 (machine has 0 and 1), then 3 (machine has 0,1,3), and the light turned on. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves 3 on the machine, and the light is off. So when 3 is alone, it's off. So 3 alone is not sufficient. Therefore, 3 is a blicket but needs another condition.\n\nAnother idea: the machine activates when the total number of blickets on it is even. If 3 is a blicket, then when 3 is alone (1, odd) it's off. When 3 is with two non-blickets (0 and 1), total blickets =1 (odd) \u2192 off. Wait, but in that case, adding 3 to 0 and 1 would still be 1 blicket, so machine should stay off. But according to the previous steps, it turned on. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, if 0 and 3 are blickets. When 0,1,3 are on, two blickets (0 and 3). Then even number \u2192 machine on. When 3 is alone (1 blicket, odd) \u2192 off. But when I removed 0 and 1, leaving 3, which is a blicket (1, odd), machine off. Then putting 0 and 3 on would be two blickets (even), machine on. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nBut when I put 0 on the machine (alone) first, the machine was off. So if 0 is a blicket, then putting it alone should activate the machine if the rule is \"at least one\". But it didn't. So 0 can't be a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. Suppose 1 and 3 are blickets. When they are both on the machine (without 0), machine should activate. Let's test that.\n\nCurrent state: object 3 is on the machine, light is off. If I put object 1 on, then the machine has 1 and 3. If they are blickets, then two blickets \u2192 machine on. Let's try that.\n\nSo the next command would be to put object 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, that supports the two-blicket hypothesis. If not, then another idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is a multiple of three. But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the sum of the objects' numbers is even. But that's a stretch. Let's see:\n\nWhen objects 0,1,3 are on: sum is 0+1+3=4 (even) \u2192 machine on. When 3 is alone: sum 3 (odd) \u2192 machine off. But this is a possible numerical rule. But how does that relate to blickets? The problem states that blickets make the machine turn on. So perhaps the blickets are the even-numbered objects. But object 0 is even, 1 and 3 are odd. But in the initial state, object 2 (even) was on the machine and the light was off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when there are more than two objects on it. But then, when three are on, it's on; when two or fewer, off. Which fits the previous steps. But in that case, the blickets would be irrelevant. But the problem states that blickets are the ones that make the machine turn on. So this would mean that the rule is not based on blickets, but on the count of objects, which contradicts the problem's premise. Therefore, this is unlikely.\n\nBack to the initial thought: the machine activates when all blickets are on it. So if the blickets are 0,1,3, then when all three are on, machine on. If any are missing, off. This fits the previous observations. Let's test this.\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 3. Light is off. So we need to put 0 and 1 back on. If we put 0 and 1 on the machine (now 0,1,3), the light should turn on. Then removing any of them should turn it off. Let's try that.\n\nSo the next commands would be:\n\nput object 0 on the machine \u2192 machine now has 0 and 3. Light is off.\n\nThen put object 1 on the machine \u2192 machine has 0,1,3. Light turns on.\n\nThen take object 0 off \u2192 machine has 1,3. Light turns off.\n\nThis would support the hypothesis that all three are required.\n\nAlternatively, if after putting 0 and 1 on, the light turns on, then that confirms that all three are needed. But according to the previous steps, when I added 3 to 0 and 1, the light turned on. So in the current state, after removing 0 and 1, the machine has 3. If I put 0 and 1 back on, the machine should turn on again. Let's try that.\n\nSo next step: put object 0 on the machine. Then put object 1 on. If the light turns on, then the rule is that all three (0,1,3) must be on. But how do I know if those are the blickets?\n\nIf the rule is that all blickets must be on, then the blickets are 0,1,3. But how to confirm that? Because if there's another blicket, say object 2, which was initially on the machine, but the light was off. So object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blickets are 3 and another object. Let's say 3 and 0. Then the rule could be that both must be present. So when 3 and 0 are on, machine on. But in previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on (without 3), the machine was off. Then adding 3 (so 0,1,3) turned it on. If the rule requires 0 and 3, then having them plus 1 (non-blicket) would still activate the machine. But then when only 3 is on, it's off. That fits. So maybe 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is both must be present. Let's test that.\n\nCurrent state: machine has 3. Light off. Put 0 on: machine has 0 and 3. If the rule is both must be present, the light should turn on. Let's see.\n\nSo the next command would be to put object 0 on the machine.\n\nIf the light turns on, then 0 and 3 are blickets. If not, then another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that at least two blickets are present, and 0 and 3 are blickets, then putting them on would activate the machine.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, when 0 was on alone, the light was off. So 0 isn't a blicket. Therefore, that hypothesis is invalid.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's summarize:\n\n- When 0,1,3 are on, machine on.\n\n- When any of them are removed, machine off.\n\n- Initial state: 2 on machine, machine off.\n\nSo likely rule: machine activates when all three (0,1,3) are present. Thus, they are all blickets.\n\nBut how to confirm this? By adding them again and seeing the light turn on.\n\nSo next step: put object 0 on the machine (currently has 3). Then put 1 on. If the light turns on, then yes. Let's do that.\n\nBut I need to choose one command at a time. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state: objects on machine: 3.\n\n> put object 0 on the machine.\n\nIf the light turns on, then 0 and 3 are blickets and rule is both must be present. If it stays off, then proceed.\n\nAfter putting 0 on, machine has 0 and 3. Light is off. Then put 1 on: machine has 0,1,3. Light turns on. Then take 1 off: light turns off. So that would support the all-three hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, if after putting 0 on (so 0 and 3), the light is still off, then putting 1 on would turn it on, suggesting that all three are needed.\n\nSo the next command should be to put object 0 on the machine.\n\nAfter that, if the light is still off, then put 1 on. Let's see.\n\nBut since I can only output one command now, I'll proceed."}

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine's light is off initially, and objects can be placed on it or the floor.\n\nFrom the previous steps, when all objects 0, 1, 3 were on the machine, the light turned on. Then, when objects 0 and 1 were removed, leaving only 3, the light turned off. But when object 0 was put back on (with 3 still there?), the light turned on again. Wait, let me check the exact sequence:\n\n1. Initially, object 2 was on the machine, but taking it off didn't trigger anything.\n2. Then objects 0,1,3 were added one by one. After adding 3, the machine turned on. So with 0,1,3 on, light on.\n3. Then removing 0 and 1 left only 3 on the machine, and the light turned off.\n4. Putting object 0 back on the machine (so 0 and 3 are on) turned the light on again.\n\nHmm. So when 0 and 3 are on together, the machine activates. But when 0 was placed on the machine alone earlier (before 1 and 3 were added), it didn't turn on. Wait, no: initially, after taking 2 off, putting 0 on the machine didn't turn it on. Then adding 1 didn't, then adding 3 did. Then removing 0 and 1 left only 3, and the light turned off. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 3 are on) turned it on again.\n\nSo this suggests that the combination of 0 and 3 being on the machine activates it. But why did adding 3 when 0 and 1 were already on make it turn on? Let's see: after 0,1,3 were all on, the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving 3) turned it off. Then adding 0 back (so 0 and 3) turned it on again. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when both 0 and 3 are present, regardless of others. But in that case, when 0 and 3 are on, with or without others, the light is on. Let's test that hypothesis.\n\nWait, when 0,1,3 were all on, the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves 3, which turns it off. Then putting 0 back (so 0 and 3) turns it on. So that suggests that 0 and 3 together are sufficient. But what about when 0 was alone initially? When 0 was first put on, the light stayed off. Then adding 1 didn't help. Then adding 3 turned it on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires at least two specific blickets to be on it. Let's consider possible rules.\n\nPossible rules:\n- At least two blickets are on the machine. If 0 and 3 are blickets, then when they're both on, the machine activates. But when 0 was alone, it didn't. When 3 is alone, it didn't. When both are present, it does. But when 0,1,3 are on, since 1 might not be a blicket, but 0 and 3 are, so their presence is enough. Then removing 0 and 1 leaves only 3 (not enough), then adding 0 back makes 0 and 3 (sufficient). That fits. So maybe 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be on it. Wait, no. If all blickets must be on, but there are two, then having both 0 and 3 on would activate. If there's only one blicket, then putting that one on would activate. But in this case, putting 3 on the machine with others didn't activate until 0 was added. Wait, no. Let's re-examine the steps:\n\nInitial state: objects 0,1,3 on floor, 2 on machine. After taking 2 off, putting 0 on, light off. Then put 1 on, light still off. Put 3 on, light turns on. So with 0,1,3 on, light on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 and 3) turns light off. Then removing 1 (leaving 3) still off. Then putting 0 back (0 and 3) turns light on. So the presence of both 0 and 3 activates the machine. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be on the machine. Then, in the first case when they were all three on (0,1,3), the presence of 0 and 3 triggers it. Then, when only 3 is on, it's off. Then adding 0 (so 0 and 3) activates again. So that suggests 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. But what about object 1? When 0,1,3 were on, the light was on. But when 0 and 3 are on with 1, it's still on. So maybe the presence of 1 doesn't affect it. So the rule could be that the machine activates when all blickets (which are 0 and 3) are present, regardless of other objects. So even if non-blickets are on the machine, as long as all blickets are present, it activates.\n\nBut how do we know if 1 or 2 are also blickets? For example, maybe the rule is that at least two blickets must be present, and 0,3 are blickets. Then, when 0 and 3 are on, it's on. When 0,3, and 1 (non-blicket) are on, it's still on. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two specific blickets are on. Let's see.\n\nWait, when object 2 was initially on the machine, but the light was off. So putting 2 on alone doesn't activate. So 2 is not a blicket. Then, when 0 was added alone, nothing. Then 1 added, still nothing. Then 3 added, activates. So that's 0,1,3 on, light on. Then removing 0 and 1, leaving 3, light off. Then adding 0 back (0 and 3) activates. So that suggests that 0 and 3 are both needed. So maybe they're both blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there are only two blickets (0 and3), then when both are on, regardless of others, the machine activates. So even with 1 on, as long as 0 and3 are present, it's on.\n\nBut then, when 0 and3 are on, adding 1 (non-blicket) doesn't affect the light. Similarly, if the rule is that the machine activates if any two blickets are present, but there are more than two blickets. Wait, but in the first test, putting 0 and1 on didn't activate, then adding 3 did. So maybe 3 is a blicket, and 0 is not. Wait, but when 0 and3 are on, it activates. So if 3 is the only blicket, then putting 3 on would activate it. But when 3 was added with 0 and1 already on, the machine activated. But when 3 was alone (after removing 0 and1), the machine was off. That's a contradiction. So that suggests that 3 alone isn't sufficient. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present, and both 0 and3 are blickets. So two blickets: 0 and3. When both are on, the machine activates. When only one is on, it doesn't. Let's check.\n\nPutting 0 on alone: no activation. Putting 3 on alone: no activation. Putting both 0 and3 on: activation. That fits. But in the previous steps, when 0,1,3 were on, the machine activated. So 0 and3 are blickets, and 1 is not. Then, when 0 and3 are on, regardless of other objects, the machine activates. So the rule is that the machine activates when both blickets (0 and3) are present. So any combination where both are on the machine, regardless of others, activates it. So even if non-blickets are on the machine, as long as 0 and3 are present, it's on.\n\nBut then, in the step where 0 was placed on the machine with 3 already on (after removing 1), the light turned on. That fits.\n\nSo the current hypothesis is that blickets are 0 and3, and the rule is that the machine activates when both are on the machine.\n\nBut to confirm, we need to test other combinations. For example, what if we put 0 and3 on the machine without any others? Let's see. Let's check the current state.\n\nAfter the last action, object 0 is on the machine. Previously, after putting 0 back on, the light turned on. Wait, when the user took 0 and1 off, leaving 3 on the machine (light off). Then put 0 back on (so 0 and3), the light turned on. So that confirms that 0 and3 together activate the machine.\n\nNow, what if we take 3 off and put 0 on? Let's see. But according to the previous steps, when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. So the next step would be to test putting 3 on with 0 already on. But that's already been done.\n\nBut perhaps there's another angle. What if the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two objects are on, and those two are 0 and3. But in the first case, when 0,1,3 were on, the machine activated. So that would contradict that, unless the rule is at least two, but specific ones. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if any two blickets are present. If there are three blickets, then any two would do. But from the previous steps, that doesn't fit. For example, putting 0 and1 on didn't activate. So 1 is not a blicket. Putting 0 and3 on activates, so they are blickets. So the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be present, and there are two: 0 and3. So whenever both are on the machine, regardless of others, it activates. That seems to fit.\n\nBut let's check another scenario. Suppose we have 0 and3 on the machine, then add another object. Does the light stay on? According to the previous steps, when 0,1,3 were on, the light was on. Then removing 1 didn't affect it. Wait, no. When 0,1,3 were on, the light was on. Then the user took 0 off, which left 1 and3, and the light turned off. Then took 1 off, leaving 3, then put 0 back (so 0 and3), light on. So adding 1 to 0 and3 doesn't affect the light. It stays on. So the presence of non-blickets doesn't matter. Only the presence of all blickets (0 and3) is required. So the rule is that the machine activates if and only if all blickets are on it. In this case, the blickets are 0 and3. So any time both are on the machine, the light is on, regardless of other objects. If either is missing, it's off.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that objects 0 and3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when both are placed on it."}
