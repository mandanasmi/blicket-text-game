Let me start by recalling what happened so far. Initially, all objects (0, 1, 2, 3) were on the floor. The machine was off. \n\nFirst, I put object 0 on the machine, and the machine stayed off. Then I added object 1 on top of that, and the machine turned on. Hmm, so when both 0 and 1 are on the machine, it activates. But does that mean either of them is a blicket, or both? Wait, but when I put object 0 alone, nothing happened. Then adding 1 made it work. So maybe object 1 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is needed. But why didn't 0 alone work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine together. But wait, when I put 0 first, machine was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So the combination of 0 and 1 might be required. But maybe 1 is the only blicket. Let me test that. If I remove object 0 and leave 1 on the machine, does it stay on? Wait, but the previous step after putting 1 on, the machine turned on. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, first command: put 0 on machine. Machine is off. Then put 1 on machine. Machine turns on. So when both 0 and 1 are on the machine, it's on. So maybe the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket activates the machine. But then why didn't 0 activate it? So maybe 0 isn't a blicket, and 1 is. So putting 1 alone would turn it on. But wait, when I put 1 on the machine after 0, the machine turned on. But was 0 still on the machine then? Yes. So perhaps 1 is a blicket, and the machine only needs one. But why didn't it turn on when I put 1 first? Wait, no. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, first step: I put object 0 on the machine. Then the machine's light is off. Then I put object 1 on the machine, and the light turns on. So after adding 1, the machine turns on. So the presence of object 1 on the machine causes it to activate. But why didn't it activate when I put 1 on the machine first? Wait, maybe the order matters. Let me think: when I put 0 on, then 1, the machine turns on. But if I had put 1 first, then 0, would it also turn on? Or maybe the machine activates if any blicket is present, regardless of order. But in this case, when I added 1 after 0, it turned on. So perhaps 1 is a blicket, and 0 is not. Therefore, when 1 is placed on the machine, even with 0, the machine activates. But maybe I need to test putting 1 alone. Wait, but how? Because right now, both 0 and 1 are on the machine. So maybe I should take off 0 and see if the machine stays on.\n\nWait, but the machine's state might change when objects are removed. So perhaps the current state is that with both 0 and 1 on, the machine is on. If I remove 0, does it stay on? Let's try that. So the next step would be to take object 0 off the machine and see if the machine remains on. If it does, then 1 alone is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 0 and 1 are needed. But since the machine turned on when 1 was added, maybe 1 is the key.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket is needed, and 1 is the blicket. So when 1 is placed, the machine turns on. But in the first step, when 0 was placed alone, nothing happened. Then adding 1 (a blicket) caused activation. But then, if I remove 0, leaving only 1, the machine should stay on. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user's previous steps were: put 0 on machine (light off), then put 1 on machine (light on). So current state: objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, others on floor. Machine is on. So if I take object 0 off, leaving 1, does the machine stay on? If yes, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the combination is needed. So next step should be taking 0 off.\n\nBut the user has to decide. Since the current step count is limited (32 steps), maybe it's efficient to test that. So command: take object 0 off machine. Then observe if the light stays on. If yes, then 1 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 0 and 1 are needed (but that seems unlikely, as 0 alone didn't do anything). Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but only when placed in a certain order. Hmm, but that complicates things. Let me proceed step by step."}

So the machine turns on when certain objects, called blickets, are placed on it. The challenge is to determine which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to activate.\n\nFrom the previous steps: putting object 0 on the machine alone didn't turn it on. Then adding object 1 caused the light to turn on. When object 0 was removed, the light turned off again. Hmm. So when both 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light was on.

So when object 0 was removed, leaving only object 1, the light went off. That suggests that maybe both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine for it to activate. But wait, when they added object 1 while object 0 was already on, the light turned on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. So the presence of both 0 and 1 together causes the machine to activate. But that would mean both are blickets. But wait, when you put 0 first, nothing happened. Then adding 1 made it turn on. So maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is needed, but when both are present, it's still on. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Let me think again.\n\nWait, step by step:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine. Light is off. So object 0 alone doesn't activate the machine. So maybe it's not a blicket.\n\n2. Then put object 1 on machine. Now both 0 and 1 are on the machine. Light turns on. So maybe the presence of object 1 is what's making it work. But when object 0 is removed, leaving only 1, the light turns off. Wait, that contradicts that. Because if object 1 is a blicket, then having it alone should keep the light on. But in the step after taking 0 off, the light went off. So that suggests that object 1 isn't a blicket by itself. Wait, perhaps the rule is that exactly two blickets need to be on the machine. Or maybe the rule is that the machine activates when a certain combination is present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates if any blicket is present, but when you added object 1, the machine turned on. Then when you took object 0 off, perhaps object 1 was still on the machine. Wait, but the light turned off. So that would mean that object 1 alone isn't a blicket. Hmm, but then why did the light turn on when 1 was added to 0? Wait, maybe object 1 is a blicket, but the rule is that the machine only stays on if all blickets are present. Wait, but that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it activates when exactly one blicket is on it. But in that case, when object 0 (non-blicket) is placed, nothing. Then adding object 1 (blicket) makes it on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1 (blicket), so machine should stay on. But in the previous steps, after removing 0, the light turned off. That contradicts that.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it activates when the number of blickets on it is odd. But with two blickets, that would be even, so off. Wait, but that seems more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine requires all blickets to be on it. So if there are two blickets (say 1 and 2), then both need to be on. But in the previous steps, only 0 and 1 were on. So maybe 0 is not a blicket, 1 is a blicket, but the rule is that another blicket is needed. Wait, but then adding 1 to 0 made the machine turn on. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But when object 0 was on alone, machine was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. Then removing 0 leaves 1, so machine should stay on. But in the steps, after removing 0, the light went off. So that suggests that when only 1 was on, the machine turned off. Therefore, 1 alone isn't a blicket. Wait, but then why did adding 1 to 0 make the machine turn on? Unless 0 and 1 together form a blicket combination. Like, the rule is that both need to be present. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets. But then when both are on, the machine is on. But when you take 0 off, leaving 1, machine turns off. That would fit. So the rule is that the machine turns on if both 0 and 1 are on it. But then the question is: are those the only two blickets? But there are objects 2 and 3 as well. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when any two specific objects are present. Or maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But we don't know how many blickets there are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the sum of the blickets' weights or something is required. But that's more complex.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when exactly one blicket is on it. So when object 0 (non-blicket) is on, nothing. Add object 1 (blicket), now one blicket, machine on. Remove object 0 (non-blicket), so only object 1 (blicket) remains, so machine stays on. But in the previous steps, after taking 0 off, the light turned off. That contradicts this. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it's activated when a blicket is placed, but deactivates when a non-blicket is present. But that also seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine is on when there's an odd number of blickets on it. So if 1 is a blicket and 0 is not. Then when 0 is on (0 blickets), off. Add 1 (1 blicket), on. Remove 0 (still 1 blicket), should stay on. But in the steps, after removing 0, the machine turned off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So let's recap the steps again:\n\n1. Put 0 on: machine off.\n\n2. Put 1 on: machine on.\n\n3. Take 0 off: machine off.\n\nSo when 0 and 1 are both on, machine is on. When only 1 is left, machine is off. So that suggests that the presence of both 0 and 1 is required for the machine to activate. But that would mean both are blickets. But why does putting 0 alone not do anything? If both are required, then the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be on it. So if there are two blickets (0 and 1), both need to be on. But in that case, putting either alone wouldn't work. Then adding both would. That seems to fit.\n\nBut then objects 2 and 3 haven't been tested yet. Maybe they are also blickets. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But how many are there? If the user has only tested 0 and 1 so far, maybe there are more blickets. Let's see.\n\nThe user needs to explore further. For example, test object 1 alone. Put 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then 1 is a blicket. But in the previous steps, when 1 was added to 0, it turned on. But when 0 was removed, leaving 1, it turned off. So maybe the machine requires the combination of 0 and 1. But that's a possible rule. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if at least two blickets are present. If 0 is not a blicket and 1 is, then adding 1 to 0 (non-blicket) would be only one blicket, which wouldn't activate the machine. But that's not what happened. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine is on if exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But in that case, putting two non-blickets would turn it on. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when a specific object (say 1) is on, but only if another object (like 0) is not. But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it activates when any single blicket is present, but only if it's the only object on the machine. But when 0 and 1 were on, it was on. Then taking 0 off would leave 1, which would then activate it. But in the steps, after taking 0 off, the machine turned off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's think of possible experiments to test.\n\nFirst, test object 1 alone. So take object 1 and put it on the machine. If the light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then maybe the combination of 0 and 1 is needed.\n\nBut in the previous steps, after putting 0 and 1 on, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 caused it to turn off. So when only 1 was left, it was off. So perhaps 1 is not a blicket. But why did adding 1 to 0 cause the machine to turn on?\n\nMaybe the machine's rule is that it activates when exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. Let's test that. If we put any two objects, the machine turns on. So when 0 and 1 were on, it turned on. Then removing one (0) leaves one, so it turns off. But to test this, we can put two different objects, like 2 and 3, and see if the machine turns on. If so, then the rule is that having two or more objects activates it. But that seems unlikely because the problem states that blickets are the ones that make the machine turn on following a hidden rule. So the rule is probably related to the presence of specific objects (blickets), not the number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. So if 1 is a blicket, then when it's on the machine alone, the light should be on. But according to the previous steps, when 1 was on with 0, the light was on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1) turned it off. That contradicts that. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it activates if the total number of blickets on it is even. So if 0 is a blicket and 1 is not. When 0 is on (1 blicket, odd), machine off. Adding 1 (non), total 1, still odd, machine off. That doesn't fit. Or if 0 is not and 1 is. Then 0 alone: 0 blickets (even), machine on? But in the first step, putting 0 alone didn't turn it on. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires exactly one blicket. If 1 is a blicket, then putting it alone should work. But in the steps, after removing 0, leaving 1, the light turned off. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates when two specific blickets are present. For example, 0 and 1 together. So both are blickets, but only when they're both on the machine. Then, any other combination would not. But then what about objects 2 and 3? Are they also part of the rule?\n\nAnother possibility: the machine's rule is that it activates when any blicket is present, but if a non-blicket is also present, it deactivates. So if 1 is a blicket and 0 is not. When you put 0 on (non), machine off. Then add 1 (blicket), but since a non-blicket (0) is present, the machine turns off. But in the steps, when adding 1 to 0, the machine turned on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the machine activates if all objects on it are blickets. So if you have a mix of blickets and non-blickets, it's off. So if 0 is a non-blicket and 1 is a blicket. Putting 0 on: off. Adding 1 (so mix), machine off. But in the steps, adding 1 made it turn on. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present, but only if it's the only object on the machine. So if you have a blicket and another object, it's off. So, if 1 is a blicket. When you put 0 and 1 on, the machine is off (because there's a non-blicket present). But in the steps, adding 1 to 0 made the machine turn on. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's try to test some hypotheses.\n\nFirst, let's consider that object 1 is a blicket. Then, putting 1 alone should activate the machine. But in the previous steps, when 0 was removed, leaving 1, the machine turned off. So that suggests that 1 alone isn't enough. So maybe 1 isn't a blicket. But when it was added to 0, the machine turned on. So what's the interaction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the blickets' IDs is a certain value. For example, 0 +1 =1. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the machine's rule is that it activates when a blicket is placed on it, but only if it's the first object. So if you put a non-blicket first, then adding a blicket doesn't activate it. But in the steps, putting 0 (non) first, then adding 1 (blicket) activated it. That seems possible. Then taking 0 off removes the first object, leaving 1 (blicket), but since it's not the first, the machine turns off. But this seems too specific and not a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it activates when a certain combination of objects are present, regardless of order. Like, 0 and 1 together. So both are blickets. Then, when either is removed, it turns off.\n\nBut then, the question is, are there other blickets? Maybe objects 2 and 3 are also part of the rule. For example, the rule could be that all even-numbered objects are blickets, and the machine activates when at least one is present. But in that case, putting 0 alone should activate it, but in the first step, it didn't. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are on it, and objects 0 and 1 are the blickets. So when both are on, it's on. Removing one turns it off. Then objects 2 and 3 are not blickets. But how to confirm this? We need to test other combinations.\n\nSo possible next steps: try putting object 1 alone on the machine. If the machine turns on, then 1 is a blicket, and the rule is that any blicket activates it. But if it doesn't, then the rule requires both 0 and 1. But according to previous steps, when 1 was added to 0, the machine turned on. Then taking 0 off made it turn off. So perhaps the machine only turns on when both 0 and 1 are present. So both are blickets, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut wait, why would both need to be on? That would imply that the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be present. But how many blickets are there? If only 0 and 1 are blickets, then putting both on activates it. Taking one off deactivates. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut we need to test other objects as well. For example, put object 2 and 3 on the machine, see if the light turns on. If not, then they aren't blickets. Alternatively, test combinations of 0 with 2, etc.\n\nSo the next command should be to put object 1 on the machine alone. Let's see what happens.\n\nIf the user does 'put object 1 on machine' now, but in the current state, after taking object 0 off, the machine has object 1 on it. Wait, no. Let's check the previous steps again.\n\nThe user's actions so far:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine. Light off.\n\n2. Put object 1 on machine. Light on.\n\n3. Take object 0 off. Light off.\n\nSo after step 3, object 1 is still on the machine. Because the user took object 0 off. So currently, the machine has object 1 on it, and the light is off. So putting object 1 again isn't possible. Wait, no: after taking object 0 off, the machine has object 1 on it. Because the user added object 1 in step 2, and hasn't removed it. So after step 3, the machine has object 1 on it, and the light is off.\n\nSo now, the machine has object 1 on it. The light is off. So perhaps object 1 alone isn't a blicket. Then why did adding it to object 0 make the machine turn on?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the machine's rule is that it activates when object 0 and 1 are both on, regardless of others. So both are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. But then, what about objects 2 and 3? We need to test them.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when any two objects are on it. But then, putting objects 2 and 3 should activate it. Let's test that.\n\nAnother approach: try putting object 1 alone. Wait, but in the current state, object 1 is already on the machine. The light is off. So if the user does 'look', they can see which objects are on the machine. But maybe they should check first.\n\nBut since the user is the agent, they need to issue commands. So perhaps the next step is to take object 1 off, then put it back alone.\n\nBut let's think. Current state: machine has object 1 on it, light off. So object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. So object 1 is not a blicket. Then why when added to object 0 did it activate? Because maybe the combination of 0 and 1 activates the machine, but neither alone. So the rule is that the machine activates when both 0 and 1 are present. So both are blickets. But the problem states that blickets are objects that make the machine turn on. So if both 0 and 1 are required, then each is a blicket, and the rule is that both must be present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. So if you put any two objects, it activates. Let's test that by putting 2 and 3.\n\nBut in the initial steps, putting 0 and 1 activated it. Removing 0 deactivates. So the number of objects on the machine matters. If the rule is based on the number, then two objects activate it. But when 0 and 1 were on (two objects), it was on. When only 1 (one object), it's off. So if the rule is that the machine activates when two or more objects are on it, then putting any two should work. But the problem says that blickets are the ones that make it work. So the number alone wouldn't be the rule unless all objects are blickets, which they aren't.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are on it. So if both 0 and 1 are blickets, then having both on activates it. But if only one is on, it doesn't. That would fit the previous steps. So then, the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. But then, to test this, we could put objects 1 and 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then both 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then maybe only 0 and 1 are.\n\nBut since we have limited steps, need to test efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. But then, if 1 is a blicket, putting it alone should activate it. But in the current state, it's on the machine alone and the light is off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the blickets' properties (like their IDs) meets a certain condition. For example, sum is even or odd. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother angle: the user has to test each object individually first. So far, object 0 was tested alone (no activation), object 1 was added to 0 (activation). Then object 0 removed, leaving 1 (no activation). So perhaps objects 0 and 1 are both required. Now, test object 2 alone: put object 2 on machine. If light turns on, it's a blicket. If not, then perhaps 2 isn't.\n\nBut the user needs to manage steps efficiently. So maybe next steps:\n\n1. Take object 1 off the machine (since it's currently on, light off).\n\n2. Put object 2 on machine alone. Check light.\n\nIf light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then not.\n\nBut the user has to consider that they can only put or take objects one at a time.\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 1 on it, light off.\n\nSo next command could be 'take object 1 off machine'. Then put object 2 on.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nAfter taking object 1 off, the machine is empty. Light is off.\n\nPut object 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then not.\n\nIf 2 is a blicket, then the rule might be that any single blicket activates it. But in previous steps, object 1 alone didn't. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, if object 2 alone doesn't activate the machine, then maybe 2 isn't a blicket. Then test 3.\n\nBut this could take many steps.\n\nAlternatively, the user could test whether putting object 1 and 2 together activates the machine. If it does, then perhaps one of them is a blicket and the other isn't, or both are.\n\nBut given the previous results, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two specific objects are present. For example, 0 and 1. Then, objects 2 and 3 are not blickets.\n\nBut to confirm, need to test other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when any two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. So put two objects on and see. For example, put 2 and 3. If light turns on, then the rule is based on quantity. But the problem states that the rule is based on blickets.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 1 on it, light off.\n\nSo the user knows that object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. But when it was added to object 0, the machine turned on.\n\nSo the next logical step is to test object 0 and 1 again, to confirm that together they activate the machine.\n\nSo take object 1 off (since it's currently on), then put 0 and 1 back on.\n\nBut that would take two steps.\n\nAlternatively, since object 1 is already on the machine, put object 0 back on. Then check if the light turns on.\n\nSo next command: put object 0 on machine.\n\nIf the light turns on, that confirms that the combination of 0 and 1 activates it. Then the user can conclude that both are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present.\n\nAlternatively, if putting 0 on again with 1 already on doesn't activate, then something else is going on.\n\nBut according to previous steps, when object 0 was added first, then 1, the light turned on. Now, if object 1 is already on, and adding 0 again (but maybe you can't put the same object on twice. Wait, the commands are 'put object X on machine' \u2014 assuming that objects can only be on the machine once. So in the current state, object 1 is on the machine, and object 0 is on the floor.\n\nSo the user can put object 0 on the machine again. Then the machine would have 0 and 1 on it. If the light turns on, that confirms that the combination of 0 and 1 is needed.\n\nSo the next command would be 'put object 0 on machine'.\n\nAfter that, if the light turns on, then the user can be more confident. Then, they can test removing one again to see.\n\nBut let's simulate this:\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 1 (light off).\n\nUser puts object 0 on machine. Now machine has 0 and 1. Light turns on.\n\nThen take object 1 off: machine has 0. Light turns off.\n\nThen take object 0 off: machine empty. Light off.\n\nThen put object 1 on: light off.\n\nPut object 0 on: light off. Then add 1: light on.\n\nThis would suggest that the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be present.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm if other combinations work. For example, putting 0 and 2.\n\nSo the user could take all objects off, then put 0 and 2 on. If the light doesn't turn on, then 2 isn't a blicket. If it does, then maybe 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\nBut given the previous steps, 0 alone doesn't activate, and 1 alone doesn't. But 0+1 does. So likely, the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets and must be present together.\n\nBut there are other objects to test. So the user should check 2 and 3.\n\nBut with limited steps, maybe the user should also test other objects.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine activates when any two blickets are present, regardless of which ones. If there are more than two blickets, then any pair would work. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present, but in the previous case, adding 1 to 0 (non-blicket) made it activate, implying that 1 is a blicket. But when 1 is alone, it's off. That's conflicting.\n\nThis is really tricky. To proceed, the user should test other combinations.\n\nAfter confirming that 0 and 1 together activate the machine, the next step is to test other objects.\n\nSo next steps:\n\n1. Put 0 and 1 on machine: light on.\n\n2. Take both off.\n\n3. Put 2 on machine: light off. So 2 is not a blicket.\n\n4. Put 2 and 3 on machine: light off. So no effect.\n\nAlternatively, if putting 2 and 3 activates the machine, then they might be blickets.\n\nBut given the initial steps, the user has to explore.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the objects' IDs is even. For example, 0+1=1 (odd), but in the steps, it turned on. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine's rule is that it activates when any even-numbered object is present. So 0 and 2 are blickets. But when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when a prime-numbered object is present. So 1, 2, 3, but 0 is not. But putting 1 alone didn't activate in the previous steps.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. The best approach is to systematically test each object alone, then combinations.\n\nBut given the step limit, the user needs to be efficient.\n\nBased on the previous steps, the most likely scenario is that objects 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present on the machine for it to activate. To confirm, the user can add 0 back to the machine (currently has 1) and see if the light turns on again.\n\nSo next command: put object 0 on machine."}

So far, I've done a few actions.\n\nFirst, I put object 0 on the machine alone, and the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. Then I took object 0 off, leaving only object 1, and the light turned off. Then I put object 0 back on with object 1, and the light came on again. Wait, no. Let me check again. \n\nWait, after putting object 0 on the machine first, the light was off. Then adding object 1 turned it on. Then taking object 0 off (so only object 1 is left) made the light turn off. Then putting object 0 back on (so now 0 and 1 are on the machine) turned it on again. So that suggests that both 0 and 1 being present makes the machine turn on. But when I first put object 0 alone, it didn't work. Then when I added 1, it did. So maybe either both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that at least two blickets are needed. Or maybe one of them is a blicket but needs another. Hmm.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 alone, machine off. Then added 1, machine on. Then removing 0 (only 1 remains), machine off. Then putting 0 back (so both 0 and 1 are there), machine on. So when both are on, it works. If either is alone, it doesn't. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine. So they are both blickets. But wait, maybe the rule is that exactly two blickets are required, but maybe there's another combination. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of blickets must be even? Or some other condition.\n\nBut let's see. Let's test other combinations. We need to check other objects. So objects 2 and 3 are still on the floor. Let's try putting object 2 on the machine with object 1. Wait, first, maybe try putting object 1 alone. Wait, when I put object 0 and 1 together, it works. But when I take 0 off, leaving 1 alone, it's off. So putting 1 alone doesn't work. Then, maybe 1 is a blicket but needs another? Or perhaps the rule is that two blickets must be present. So maybe 0 and 1 are both blickets. Then, putting either alone doesn't work, but together they do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket is needed, but in that case, when object 1 was alone, the machine should have been on. But when I put object 1 on the machine alone after taking 0 off, the light was off. Wait, wait, the initial steps were:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Put 1 on machine (now 0 and 1 are on): light on.\n3. Take 0 off (only 1 remains): light off.\n4. Put 0 back (0 and 1 on): light on.\n\nSo from this, when both 0 and 1 are on, light is on. Either alone, it's off. So perhaps the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires all blickets to be present. But that would mean that the machine only turns on when all blickets are on it. But if there are more blickets, like 2 or 3, then adding them would be necessary. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the presence of any two blickets turns the machine on, but if there's only one, it doesn't. So if 0 and 1 are both blickets, then putting them together works. But what if there's a third blicket?\n\nWait, but there are four objects. Maybe the rule is that the machine requires an even number of blickets. Let's test that. But first, perhaps test with object 2. Let's see. Let's try putting object 2 on the machine with object 1. If 1 is a blicket and 2 is a blicket, then maybe putting 1 and 2 on would turn the machine on. If not, then maybe only 0 and 1 are blickets.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step. Let's take object 0 off again. So machine is empty. Then put object 1 on the machine. If the machine is off, then maybe 1 alone isn't a blicket. Wait, but when 1 was on the machine with 0, it turned on. But when 1 is alone, it's off. So maybe 1 isn't a blicket by itself. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two objects are on it, regardless of which ones. But that's unlikely because when I had 0 and 1, it worked. But when I took 0 off, leaving 1, it turned off. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of the object numbers is even. Let's see: 0 +1 =1, which is odd. But the machine was on. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when the number of blickets on it is odd. But in the case of 0 and 1: if both are blickets, then two blickets would make it even, so machine off. But in the experiment, when both were on, it was on. So that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket. But when 0 was alone, it didn't work. Then adding 1 (a possible blicket) made it work, but removing 0 (leaving 1) made it off again. So that suggests that 0 is not a blicket, but 1 is, but the machine only activates when a blicket is present with another non-blicket? That seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets to be placed. So 0 and 1 are both blickets. Then putting them together activates it. But then, if there's a third blicket, like 2, putting three would deactivate it. But I need to test.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if any of the blickets are present. But that doesn't fit because when 0 was alone, it was off, but when 1 was added, it turned on. So maybe 1 is a blicket and 0 isn't. Then, when 1 is present (alone or with others), the machine is on. But that contradicts the earlier step where after putting 1 on the machine (with 0), then taking 0 off (leaving 1 alone), the machine turned off. Wait, that can't be. If 1 is a blicket, then when it's alone, the machine should be on. But according to the steps, when I took 0 off, leaving 1 on, the machine turned off. That suggests that 1 isn't a blicket. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires the presence of two specific blickets. Like, both 0 and 1 must be on. So they are both blickets, and the rule is that both need to be on the machine. Then, if either is missing, the machine turns off.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's try putting 0 and 2 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then maybe 0 and 2 are the blickets. But in the previous steps, 0 and 1 worked. So if 0 and 1 are both required, then putting 0 and 2 would not work. Let's try that.\n\nBut first, let's check the current state. The machine has object 0 and 1 on it, and the light is on. Let's take both off and try other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is even. Let's suppose that 0 and 1 are blickets. Then, two blickets (even) would turn it on. If only one is present (odd), it's off. But when 0 was alone, it didn't work. Then adding 1 (making two) turned it on. Then removing 0 (leaving one) turned it off. That fits. But what if there's another blicket, like 2? Putting 0 and 2 would also make two, so the machine would turn on. Let's test that.\n\nSo, steps to take:\n\n1. Take object 0 and 1 off the machine. Now machine is empty.\n2. Put object 0 on machine. Light off (as before).\n3. Put object 2 on machine. Now 0 and 2 are on. If the light turns on, that suggests that 0 is a blicket and 2 is a blicket (so two even). If not, maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Let's see.\n\nBut in the initial test, when 0 was alone, the light was off, but when 1 was added, it turned on. So if the rule is even number of blickets, then 0 is not a blicket, but 1 is. Then adding 0 and 1 would sum to one blicket (odd), which wouldn't fit. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's think again.\n\nLet me outline the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Rule is \"At least one blicket on the machine\". Then, in the steps:\n\n- 0 alone: off \u2192 0 not a blicket.\n- 0 +1: on \u2192 1 is a blicket.\n- 1 alone: off \u2192 contradicts, because 1 is a blicket but alone doesn't activate.\n\nSo this rule can't be.\n\nCase 2: Rule is \"All blickets must be on the machine\". Suppose there are two blickets (0 and 1). Then:\n\n- 0 alone: off (missing 1).\n- 0 +1: on (both present).\n- 1 alone: off (missing 0).\n- 0 +1 again: on.\n\nBut what if there are more blickets? Let's say 0,1,2 are blickets. Then, putting all three would be required. But that's not tested yet.\n\nCase 3: Rule is \"Exactly two blickets on the machine\". So when two are present, it turns on. If more or fewer, it's off. Then, in the previous steps:\n\n- 0 alone: off (one blicket \u2192 not two).\n- 0 +1: two \u2192 on.\n- 1 alone: one \u2192 off.\n- 0 +1 again: two \u2192 on.\n\nBut if there's another blicket, say 2, then putting 1 and 2 would also turn it on.\n\nCase 4: The machine activates if the sum of some property (like weight?) of the objects meets a threshold. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when the number of blickets is a multiple of a certain number. For example, even number. Then:\n\n- 0 alone: off (if 0 is a blicket, then 1 \u2192 odd. If 0 isn't, then zero \u2192 even. Wait, when 0 was alone, the light was off. So if the rule is even number, then zero is even. So the machine should be on when no blickets are on? That's not possible. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets. Then:\n\n- 0 alone: if 0 is a blicket, 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 on. But in the first step, putting 0 alone \u2192 light off. So that would mean 0 is not a blicket. Then adding 1 (assuming 1 is a blicket) would make count 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) \u2192 count 1 \u2192 on. But in the previous steps, when 0 was taken off, leaving 1, the light turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think again. The key observations so far:\n\n- 0 alone \u2192 off.\n- 0 +1 \u2192 on.\n- 1 alone \u2192 off.\n- 0 +1 again \u2192 on.\n\nThis suggests that the combination of 0 and 1 is required. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be present, regardless of others. So they are both blickets, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. But what if there's a third blicket? For example, if 2 is also a blicket, then putting 0,1,2 would be required? Or maybe the rule is that any two blickets will do. So perhaps 0 and 1 are blickets, and putting any two of them on the machine works. But then, if 2 is also a blicket, putting 0 and 2 should work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two specific blickets (like 0 and 1) are on. Let's test that.\n\nBut to test this, I need to try other combinations. Let's try putting 2 and 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then maybe 1 and 2 are both blickets. If not, then maybe only 0 and 1.\n\nCurrent machine state: objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, light is on. Let's take them both off first.\n\nTake object 0 off the machine: light is off. Then take object 1 off (machine empty). Now, put object 1 on the machine. Light is off (as before). Then put object 2 on the machine. So now, machine has 1 and 2. If the light turns on, then perhaps 1 and 2 are both blickets, and the rule requires two blickets. If not, maybe only 0 and 1 are.\n\nSo the command would be: put object 1 on machine (light off), then put object 2 on machine. Let's see what happens.\n\nBut I need to do one command at a time. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent state: machine is empty (after taking 0 and 1 off). Let's put object 1 on the machine first.\n\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nIf the light is off, then putting 1 alone doesn't work. Then add object 2. Let's see.\n\nBut since I can only do one command per step, let's simulate. Suppose I do:\n\nput object 1 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nThen put object 2 on machine. Now machine has 1 and 2. If light turns on, that would suggest that 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then they aren't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires the presence of all blickets. So if there are three blickets (0,1,2), then all must be on. But that's a stretch.\n\nBut given the initial steps, it's possible that 0 and 1 are the only blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. To confirm this, let's try putting 0 and 2 on the machine. If the light doesn't turn on, then 2 is not a blicket. If it does, then 2 is a blicket and the rule is that any two blickets are needed.\n\nSo steps:\n\nTake object 1 off (if needed). Machine is empty. Put 0 on \u2192 light off. Put 2 on \u2192 light? If it's on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 0 isn't a blicket, or 2 isn't.\n\nBut according to previous steps, putting 0 and 1 on \u2192 light on, but 0 alone \u2192 off. So if 0 is a blicket, then when adding a non-blicket (1), it turned on. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine needs exactly two blickets, regardless of which ones. So if 0 and 1 are both blickets, then putting them together works. If another pair (like 0 and 2) are both blickets, that would also work. But in that case, how do we know which objects are blickets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets, and there are two blickets among the four. So 0 and 1 are the only blickets, and any combination of two blickets would work. But in the initial steps, putting 0 alone didn't work, but when 0 and 1 are both on, it works. So that suggests that both are blickets.\n\nBut then, if the rule is that any two blickets must be on, then putting 0 and 1 would work, and putting any other two (if they are blickets) would also work. But we don't know yet.\n\nSo to test this, after putting 0 and 1 on and seeing the light on, perhaps try adding another object. For example, put object 2 on the machine (so now 0,1,2 are on). If the light stays on, that doesn't help much. If it turns off, maybe the rule is exactly two blickets. Alternatively, if the light stays on, maybe the rule is at least two blickets.\n\nBut first, let's check the current state. The previous steps ended with putting 0 on the machine again after taking it off, resulting in 0 and 1 being on the machine, light on. So the machine currently has 0 and 1 on it, light on.\n\nNow, what's the next step? Let's try adding object 2 to see if the light stays on. If the rule is that all blickets must be on, then adding a non-blicket (2) wouldn't affect it. But if the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed, then adding a third might not matter, unless 2 is also a blicket, which would make three, turning it off (if the rule is even number). But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of blickets is odd. Then, two blickets (even) would turn it off. But in the previous steps, when two were on, it was on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires that the number of blickets is at least two. So 0 and 1 are both blickets. Adding another blicket (say 2) would keep the machine on. Adding a non-blicket (like 2) wouldn't change it. But if 2 is a non-blicket, then having 0,1,2 (two blickets) would still activate the machine.\n\nBut how to test this? Let's add object 2 to the current setup (0 and 1 on machine, light on).\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf the light stays on, then the rule could be at least two blickets, and 0 and 1 are blickets. If the light turns off, maybe the rule requires exactly two blickets, and adding a third (even if it's not a blicket) breaks it. Or maybe 2 is a blicket, making three, which is an odd number, but that would depend on the rule.\n\nBut let's proceed. Suppose after adding object 2, the light stays on. Then, that supports that the rule is at least two blickets. If it turns off, then maybe the rule is exactly two.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine requires exactly two specific blickets, 0 and 1, and any others don't matter. So adding 2 and 3 would leave the light on, as long as 0 and 1 are present.\n\nAnother approach: Let's test object 2 alone. Put object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then it isn't.\n\nCurrent machine has 0,1,2 (if we added 2). But let's reset: take all objects off. Then put 2 on.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, the user has to issue commands. Let's assume that the machine is currently in the state after the last command: after putting object 0 on the machine (so machine has 0 and 1), light on. Now, the user can take actions. Let's think about what's the best next step.\n\nPossible options:\n\n1. Test if object 2 is a blicket by putting it on with 0 or 1.\n2. Test if object 3 is a blicket.\n3. Check if the machine requires exactly 0 and 1, or if other combinations work.\n\nTo do this, maybe take 0 and 1 off, then test other pairs.\n\nBut since steps are limited, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, take object 0 off the machine (machine has 1). Light turns off. Then take object 1 off (machine empty). Now, put object 2 on. Light off. Then put object 3 on. If light turns on, then 2 and 3 are blickets. If not, they aren't. But this would take multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, put object 2 on the machine with object 1. Let's try that. So:\n\nTake 0 off (machine has 1). Light off. Then take 1 off (machine empty). Now put 1 and 2 on.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Put 1 on: light off.\n2. Put 2 on: light? If it turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets.\n\nBut in the previous steps, putting 0 and 1 worked. If putting 1 and 2 also works, that suggests that both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that any two blickets activate the machine. But if it doesn't, then perhaps 1 is not a blicket, and the earlier result was due to 0 and 1 being required together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when two specific objects (0 and 1) are present, regardless of others. So other combinations won't work.\n\nBut this requires testing.\n\nSo, current step: the machine has 0 and 1 on, light on. Let's try adding object 2.\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nAssuming the light stays on, that doesn't tell us much. If it turns off, that's a clue.\n\nAlternatively, take 0 and 1 off and try other combinations.\n\nBut let's think about the current state again. After the last command (put object 0 on machine), the machine has 0 and 1, light on.\n\nNow, if I take object 0 off, the light turns off. Then put object 0 back, light on. So that confirms that 0 and 1 together are required. But what about other combinations?\n\nMaybe try putting object 1 and 2 together. Let's do that.\n\nSo, take object 0 off (light off). Take object 1 off (machine empty). Then:\n\n> put object 1 on machine (light off)\n> put object 2 on machine (now 1 and 2 are on. If light turns on, then they are blickets.)\n\nBut I can only do one command at a time. So first, put 1 on, then 2.\n\nAssuming after putting 1 on, light is off. Then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, they aren't.\n\nBut without knowing the result, it's hard to plan. Alternatively, let's try putting 2 and 3 on the machine.\n\nBut this will take multiple steps. Since step count is limited, I need to be efficient.\n\nAlternative plan: Given that 0 and 1 together activate the machine, and individually they don't, it's likely that both are blickets and the rule is that both must be present. However, this could also be a case where the rule is that the sum of the object numbers is even or odd, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present, and 0 and 1 are both blickets (so two, even). If another pair like 2 and 3 are blickets, putting them would also activate it.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's try putting objects 2 and 3 on the machine.\n\nSteps:\n\nTake all objects off (machine empty).\n\nPut 2 on \u2192 light off.\nPut 3 on \u2192 light? If on, then 2 and 3 are blickets. If not, they aren't.\n\nBut this requires two steps. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that objects with even numbers are blickets. 0 and 2 are even. Putting them together would activate the machine. But when 0 was alone, light was off. So that would require two even-numbered objects. But in the initial test, 0 and 1 (odd) activated it. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blickets are 1 and 0. Let's test.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what happens when we put 0 and 2 on the machine. So:\n\nTake 0 and 1 off. Machine empty.\n\nPut 0 on \u2192 light off.\nPut 2 on \u2192 light? If on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. If not, then only 0 and 1 are.\n\nAssuming the light doesn't turn on, then 2 is not a blicket. Then, put 0 and 1 on again \u2192 light on. That would confirm that 0 and 1 are the blickets.\n\nBut to do this, I need to take the current state into account. The machine currently has 0 and 1 on, light on. Let's take 0 off (light off), then take 1 off. Then put 0 on (light off), then put 2 on (if light stays off, then 2 is not a blicket. If it turns on, then 0 and 2 are blickets).\n\nBut this is multiple steps. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state after last command: machine has 0 and 1, light on.\n\nCommand 1: take object 0 off \u2192 machine has 1, light off.\nCommand 2: take object 1 off \u2192 machine empty.\nCommand 3: put object 0 on \u2192 light off.\nCommand 4: put object 2 on \u2192 light? If on, then 0 and 2 are blickets.\n\nBut each of these is a separate step. Since I have limited steps (32), but I've used 4 already, but need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, after taking 0 and 1 off, put 2 and 3 on to see if the machine activates. If it does, they are blickets. If not, they aren't.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent step: the user has to input the next command. The previous command was putting object 0 on the machine, which resulted in 0 and 1 being on, light on.\n\nNow, the next command could be to take object 1 off to see if the light stays on with 0 alone. But wait, we've already done that. Taking object 0 off when machine has 0 and 1 turns light off. So, perhaps the next step is to test other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, since putting 0 and 1 activates the machine, but each alone doesn't, the hypothesis is that both are blickets and the rule is that both must be present. But to confirm, I should check other pairs.\n\nSo, take object 0 and 1 off, then try putting 1 and 2 on.\n\nCommands:\n\ntake object 0 off machine \u2192 light off (machine has 1)\ntake object 1 off \u2192 machine empty.\nput object 1 on \u2192 light off.\nput object 2 on \u2192 check if light turns on.\n\nBut this requires multiple steps. Let's proceed:\n\nAfter the last step (machine has 0 and 1, light on), the next command would be:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nWhich would leave object 1 on the machine, light off. Then:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nNow machine is empty.\n\n> put object 1 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n> put object 2 on machine \u2192 if light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets.\n\nBut this is four steps. Since we have 32 steps, but I need to minimize them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when two specific objects (0 and 1) are placed together. Then, other combinations won't work. So the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut how to confirm that other objects aren't blickets.\n\nAnother approach: put object 3 on the machine alone. If it doesn't activate, then it's not a blicket. If it does, it is. But that's a single step.\n\nCurrent state after last command: machine has 0 and 1, light on.\n\nIf I take 0 and 1 off and put 3 on, then:\n\n> take object 0 off machine \u2192 light off (machine has 1)\n> take object 1 off \u2192 empty.\n> put object 3 on \u2192 light? If on, 3 is a blicket. If off, not.\n\nBut again, multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, since I have limited steps, perhaps I can infer that the rule is that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on, and thus they are the blickets. Other objects may not be. But to be thorough, I need to test.\n\nBut given the information so far, the most efficient next step is to test putting object 2 on the machine with object 1. Let's do that.\n\nSo:\n\nCurrent machine has 0 and 1, light on.\n\nTake object 0 off \u2192 machine has 1, light off.\nPut object 2 on \u2192 machine has 1 and 2. If light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, they aren't.\n\nSo the commands would be:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nBut each is a separate step.\n\nFirst step after previous command:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\nResult: machine has 1, light off.\n\nNext command:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then perhaps 1 isn't a blicket.\n\nBut according to previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on, it worked. Now, with 1 and 2, if it doesn't work, that suggests that 1 isn't a blicket. But that contradicts earlier results. Alternatively, maybe the rule requires 0 and 1 together. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the object numbers is 1 (0+1=1). Then, putting 1 and 2 would sum to 3, which wouldn't activate. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two objects are on it, and at least one is a blicket. But in the initial step, putting 0 (non-blicket) and 1 (blicket) would activate it. But when 1 is alone (one object), even though it's a blicket, it doesn't activate. So that's possible.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Perhaps it's best to conclude that 0 and 1 are both blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. The other objects (2 and 3) are not blickets. Thus, the next step would be to exit the game.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should test at least one more combination. For example, put object 3 on the machine with 0 and 1. If the light stays on, that supports that 0 and 1 are the only blickets. If it turns off, maybe the rule is something else.\n\nCurrent machine state after the last command (putting object 0 on machine, which resulted in 0 and 1 on, light on).\n\nIf I add object 3:\n\n> put object 3 on machine\n\nIf the light stays on, then 3 is not a blicket. If it turns off, maybe the rule is that only two specific blickets can be present. But this is unlikely. Alternatively, adding a non-blicket might not affect it.\n\nBut according to previous steps, adding a non-blicket with blickets doesn't turn the machine off. For example, when 0 and 1 were on (assuming they are blickets), adding another non-blicket (like 2 or 3) would still have the machine on. So if adding 3 doesn't change the state, it supports that 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBut let's try this.\n\nAfter adding 3, if the light stays on, then 3 is not a blicket. If it turns off, perhaps the rule is that only two objects can be on the machine, regardless of being blickets. But that seems unlikely.\n\nSo, the command would be:\n\n> put object 3 on machine\n\nAssuming the light stays on, then 3 is not a blicket, and the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets and must be present. Then, the answer would be blickets 0 and 1, rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, given the steps taken so far, this seems plausible."}

So, there are objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and the machine. The goal is to find out which ones are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then I added object 1, and the light turned on. Then taking object 0 off made the light turn off again. Wait, but when I put object 0 back on, the light came back on. Then adding object 3 kept it on. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me recap the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Add 1: light on.\n3. Remove 0: light off. So with just 1, maybe? But when I put 0 back on, light turned on again. Wait, no, after taking 0 off, the machine had only 1. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 1 together) made it on. Then adding 3, still on.\n\nWait, when I put 0 on again, the machine turned on. But initially, 0 alone didn't work. So maybe the rule isn't just having any blicket, but a combination. Let's see:\n\nFirst, putting 0 alone: off. So 0 isn't a blicket, or maybe not enough. Then adding 1: on. Then removing 0 (so only 1 remains) caused it to turn off. Wait, that suggests that 1 alone isn't enough. Wait, but when I put 0 back on (so 0 and 1), the light turned on again. Then adding 3 kept it on. But does 3 contribute?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Or maybe it's a specific combination. Let's see:\n\nPossible blickets: Let's check each object.\n\nObject 0: When placed alone, machine off. Then when placed with 1, machine on. Then when 0 is removed, leaving 1, machine off. So 1 alone doesn't work. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 1), machine on. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets. Because when either is alone, machine off, but together, on. Then adding 3, machine stays on. So maybe 3 is also a blicket, but the machine requires at least two. So putting 0 and 1: two blickets, on. Then adding 3 (another blicket), so three, still on. But maybe 3 is not a blicket, but adding it doesn't affect because two are already present. Wait, but when I added 3, the light stayed on. So perhaps 3 is also a blicket. Let me test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on when exactly two blickets are present. But after adding 3, it's three, but the light stayed on, so that's not it. So probably, the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Wait, but when 0 was alone, it didn't work. So that can't be. So maybe the machine requires two blickets to be on. Let's see:\n\nTest 1: 0 alone \u2192 off. So 0 isn't a blicket, or needs another. Then 0 and 1 \u2192 on. So if 1 is a blicket, then adding 1 to 0 (non-blicket) turns it on. But then taking 0 off (leaving 1) turns it off. So 1 alone isn't enough. So perhaps 1 isn't a blicket, but 0 and 1 together somehow? That seems odd. Or maybe 0 is a blicket but requires another. Wait, but if 0 and 1 are both blickets, then putting them together would activate the machine. Then removing 0 leaves 1, which is a blicket alone, but machine turns off. So that contradicts. Unless the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets. So if only one is present, it's off. So in that case, 0 and 1 would both be blickets, and when together, the machine turns on. Then when you add 3, if 3 is a blicket, then three blickets, so machine stays on. If 3 isn't, then two blickets (0 and 1) plus 3, so still on. But when I put 0 back on (after taking it off), so 0 and 1, machine on. Then adding 3, which may or may not be a blicket. So if 3 is a blicket, then total of three, machine remains on. If not, then two (0 and 1), so still on. So this doesn't help determine if 3 is a blicket.\n\nWait, but when I first put 0 and 1, machine on. Then after adding 3, it stays on. So maybe 3 is not a blicket. But how to check?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if the total number of blickets is even. Let's see. But 0 and 1 (assuming both are blickets) would make 2, even \u2192 on. Then adding 3, if 3 is a blicket, total 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 off. But in the step, after adding 3, the light stayed on. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of some property (like weight) of the blickets is above a threshold. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires exactly one blicket. But that doesn't fit because when 0 was alone, it didn't work, but when 1 was added (assuming 1 is a blicket), then 0 and 1, but then removing 0 (leaving 1) turns it off. Wait, no, in that case, if 1 is a blicket, then leaving it alone should turn on. But in the steps, after taking 0 off, machine off. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, let's go through the steps again:\n\n- Put 0 on machine: light off. So 0 alone doesn't activate.\n- Put 1 on machine (now 0 and 1 on machine): light turns on. So either 1 is a blicket, or combination of 0 and 1.\n- Take 0 off (only 1 remains): light turns off. So 1 alone doesn't work.\n- Put 0 back on (0 and 1 again): light turns on. So same as before.\n- Put 3 on (0, 1, 3): light stays on. So adding 3 doesn't affect it.\n\nSo possible scenarios:\n\n1. Both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But when adding 3, which is not a blicket, the machine remains on. So that's possible.\n\nBut wait, if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then if there are more blickets (like 3), then adding 3 (if it's a blicket) would be required. But in the steps, adding 3 didn't turn it off. So maybe 3 is not a blicket. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket. But that doesn't fit because 0 alone didn't work. Wait, maybe 0 is not a blicket, but 1 is. Then putting 1 alone should activate. But in the step, when 1 was alone, the machine turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that exactly two blickets must be present. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, then when both are on, the machine is on. Adding 3 (non-blicket) doesn't affect. But then, if 3 is a blicket, then three would be present, which might turn it off. But in the step, adding 3 kept it on. So maybe 3 is not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when any even number of blickets are present. If 0 and 1 are both blickets (two \u2192 even), adding 3 (non-blicket) keeps it on. If 3 is a blicket, then three \u2192 odd, which would turn it off. But in the step, adding 3 didn't turn it off. So 3 is not a blicket. So maybe the rule is even number of blickets. But then, when 0 is alone (assuming it's a blicket), that's one \u2192 odd, which would be off. Then adding 1 (another blicket), two \u2192 on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 \u2192 one \u2192 off). Then adding 0 again (two \u2192 on). Then adding 3 (non-blicket, total still two \u2192 on). That fits. So in this case, blickets are 0 and 1. Rule: even number of blickets.\n\nBut how to confirm if 2 is a blicket? Because we haven't tested it yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if the sum of the blickets' IDs is even. But that's arbitrary. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on when the number of blickets on it is odd. But that doesn't fit. Because putting 0 and 1 (two blickets) would be even \u2192 off. But in the steps, it's on.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that at least one blicket must be present. But that doesn't fit because 0 alone didn't work, but if 0 is not a blicket and 1 is, then putting 1 alone should work. But in the steps, when only 1 was on the machine (after taking 0 off), the light turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine is activated when exactly two specific blickets are present. Like a combination. For example, 0 and 1 together activate it, but others don't. Then adding 3 doesn't affect because the combination is still present. But how to test that? Let's see:\n\nIf the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be present (regardless of others), then adding 3 would still keep it on. So in that case, 0 and 1 are the only blickets. But how to confirm if 2 or 3 are blickets?\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket, but 0 is not a blicket. So putting 0 alone: off. Adding 1 (a blicket): on. Removing 0 (leaving 1): on. But in the steps, when 0 was removed (leaving 1), the light turned off. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's try to test more scenarios.\n\nSo far, we know:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n- 0 +1: on.\n- 1 alone: off.\n- 0 +1 again: on.\n- 0 +1 +3: on.\n\nSo the key is that 0 and 1 together activate the machine. But why? Maybe they are both blickets, and the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets. So when both are present, it's on. If 3 is a blicket, then adding it would mean three, which is still two or more \u2192 on. If 3 isn't a blicket, then two \u2192 on. So in either case, adding 3 doesn't change the state.\n\nBut how to check if 2 is a blicket? We need to test with 2. Let's try putting 2 on the machine with other combinations.\n\nFor example, put 2 alone: if the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket (but only if the rule is that one is enough, which previous steps don't support). But based on earlier steps, even if 2 is a blicket, putting it alone would not turn it on if the rule is needing two.\n\nAlternatively, put 2 with 0. If the machine turns on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. But previously, 0 alone didn't work. So if 0 is a blicket, then adding another (like 2) would turn it on. So if putting 0 and 2 on and the machine turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then 2 isn't.\n\nSimilarly for 3: when 3 was added to 0 and 1, the machine stayed on. But if 3 is a blicket, then three blickets (0,1,3) would still satisfy the rule of at least two. If 3 isn't, then two. So we need to test if 3 alone or with another non-blicket turns it on.\n\nBut currently, the machine has 0,1,3 on it. Let's see:\n\nIf I take off 0 and 1, leaving 3. If the light stays on, then 3 is a blicket (assuming the rule is at least one). But previous steps suggest that the rule isn't at least one. So let's try that.\n\nBut the user has to do it step by step. The current step is after putting 0,1,3 on the machine, and the light is on. So the next command would be to take off some objects to test.\n\nFor example, take 0 and 1 off, leaving 3. If the light turns off, then 3 is not a blicket. If it stays on, then 3 is a blicket (if the rule is at least one). But based on previous steps, the rule might require two. So if 3 is a blicket, then leaving it alone (if rule is two) would turn it off. So that would suggest 3 is not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if the number of blickets is even. So 0 and 1 are blickets (two \u2192 even). Adding 3 (non-blicket) \u2192 still two \u2192 on. If 3 is a blicket, three \u2192 odd \u2192 off. But in the step, adding 3 didn't turn it off. So 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBut we need to confirm. So possible next steps:\n\nTake object 1 off the machine. Now, machine has 0 and 3. If the light turns off, then 0 and 3 are not both blickets. If the light stays on, then maybe 0 and 3 are both blickets (if rule is two). But earlier, 0 alone didn't work. So if 0 is a blicket, then 0 and 3 (if 3 is also a blicket) would make two. But if the light turns off, then either 0 or 3 isn't a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, take off 3. Then machine has 0 and 1. Light is on. Then take off 1, leaving 0. Light off. Then take off 0, put 2 on. Light? If 2 is a blicket, then alone it would depend on the rule.\n\nBut given the step limit, I need to be efficient. Let's see.\n\nCurrent objects on machine: 0,1,3. Light on.\n\nIf I take 3 off, machine has 0 and 1. Light remains on. Then take 1 off: machine has 0. Light turns off. So that confirms that 0 alone isn't enough, but 0 and 1 together are. So likely, 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. Or that the machine requires exactly two blickets, and 0 and 1 are the only ones. But how to check if 2 is a blicket?\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine is on if all blickets are on it. So if 0 and 1 are the only blickets, then having both on the machine turns it on. If you add 3, it's still on. If you take one off, it turns off. But to test if there are more blickets (like 2 or 3), we need to see if putting them with others affects it.\n\nFor example, put 2 on the machine along with 0. If the light turns on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 2 isn't.\n\nSo possible next step: take all objects off, then test combinations.\n\nBut let's plan:\n\nCurrent state: 0,1,3 on machine. Light on.\n\nNext, take object 3 off. Now, 0 and 1 on machine. Light on.\n\nTake object 1 off. Now, 0 alone. Light off. So 0 isn't a blicket (if rule is at least one) or needs another.\n\nPut object 2 on machine (0 and 2). If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then 2 isn't. Let's say it doesn't turn on. Then 2 isn't a blicket.\n\nThen put 1 back on (0,1,2). Light on. Then take 0 off (1 and 2 on machine). If light remains on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 1 is a blicket and 2 isn't.\n\nBut let's see what the user should do next. The user has to choose a command now. So from the current step after putting 0,1,3 on machine, the light is on.\n\nThe next step would be to test 3. So take 3 off the machine. The light would stay on (if 0 and 1 are blickets). Then take 1 off, leaving 0. Light off. Then take 0 off. Then test 2: put 2 on machine. If light doesn't turn on, then 2 isn't a blicket. Then put 1 on. If light turns on, then 1 is a blicket, and 2 isn't. Then put 3 on. If light stays on, then 3 isn't a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, the user could test 2 by putting it with 1. For example, take all off, then put 1 and 2 on. If light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets.\n\nBut given the steps used so far (5 steps), the user has 32 steps, so can afford to test further.\n\nBut the user's next command should be to take object 3 off the machine to see if the light remains on. If it does, then 3 is not required. So:\n\n> take object 3 off machine\n\nBut let's see what happens. After taking 3 off, the machine has 0 and 1, which previously turned it on. So light stays on. Then take 1 off, leaving 0: light off. That confirms that 1 is needed with 0. Then take 0 off, put 1 on alone: light off. Then put 1 and 2 on: if light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, 2 isn't.\n\nBut maybe the user can do that. But for now, the next logical step is to remove 3 to see if it's a blicket. So command:\n\n> take object 3 off machine"}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, here's what I noticed:\n\n1. When I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then adding object 1 turned it on. But when I took object 0 off, the light went off again. Then putting object 0 back on with object 1 still there made it turn on. That suggests that maybe both 0 and 1 are needed. Wait, but when I added object 3 later, the light stayed on even after removing it. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me recap the steps:\n\n- Put 0 on \u2192 light off.\n- Put 1 on \u2192 light on. So with 0 and 1 on the machine, it's on. Then take 0 off \u2192 light off. So without 0, but 1 alone, it's off. Then put 0 back on (so 0 and 1 are on) \u2192 light on again. Then add 3 \u2192 light stays on. Then take 3 off \u2192 light remains on. \n\nSo after adding 3, even when removing it, the light stays on. That's odd. Wait, maybe the rule isn't just about having a certain combination. Let's see:\n\nAfter putting 0 and 1 on, light is on. Then adding 3 (so 0,1,3) \u2192 light stays on. Then removing 3 leaves 0 and 1, which previously worked. So that's consistent. But when I first put 0 alone, it didn't work. Then 1 alone (after removing 0) also didn't. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. Wait, but when I added 3, maybe 3 is also a blicket. Let me check.\n\nWait, when I added object 3 to 0 and 1, the light stayed on. Then removing 3 didn't affect it. So perhaps the presence of 3 wasn't necessary once 0 and 1 are there. But maybe 3 is a blicket, but the rule requires at least two. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, then adding 3 (a non-blicket) doesn't change anything. But then why when you have 0 and 1, it's on. Then adding 3 (non-blicket), still on. Then removing 3, still on. That makes sense. But when I first put 0 on alone, it didn't work. Then adding 1 made it work. So 0 and 1 must both be blickets. Then putting 0 back on with 1 made it work again. Then adding 3, which may or may not be a blicket. But when I took 3 off, the light stayed on, which is expected if 3 wasn't contributing. So maybe 3 isn't a blicket. But what about object 2? I haven't tested that yet.\n\nSo far, the possible blickets are 0 and 1. But wait, when I first put 0 alone, the light was off. Then putting 1 on made it on. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) turned it off. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 1) turned it on again. So that suggests that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be on it. Wait, no, because if the rule was that all blickets must be on, then maybe there are more blickets. Or perhaps the rule is that at least one blicket is needed. But that doesn't fit because when 0 was on alone, it didn't turn on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. Let's see: if 0 and 1 are blickets, then putting both on makes it on. If either is removed, it turns off. Then when adding 3 (non-blicket), the count remains two (0,1,3 \u2192 two blickets?), but that would still be two. Wait, but if 3 is a non-blicket, then adding it doesn't change the count. So the light stays on. Then removing 3 doesn't affect. That's consistent. But then what if the rule is that at least two blickets are present? Then 0 and 1 would be blickets. Then adding 3, a non-blicket, the count is still two, so light stays on. Then removing 3, still two. So that works. But what about object 2? I need to test that.\n\nAnother possibility is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but some objects inhibit it. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Let's test with object 2. If I put object 2 on the machine with object 0 or 1, does the light turn on?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the total number of blickets is odd. But when 0 and 1 are on (two blickets, even), that would be off, which contradicts the earlier result. So that's not it.\n\nSo far, the evidence points towards 0 and 1 being blickets, and the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. But I need to confirm this. Let's test object 2. If I put object 2 on the machine with either 0 or 1, does it activate?\n\nFor example, take off all objects. Then put 0 and 2 on. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then 2 isn't. Similarly, put 1 and 2 on. Let's try that.\n\nBut in the current state, the machine has 0,1 on, and the light is on. Wait, no: after the last command, when I took object 3 off, the machine had 0,1 on (since I had put 0 back on, then 3, then took 3 off). Wait, the previous steps:\n\n1. put 0 \u2192 light off.\n2. put 1 \u2192 light on (so 0 and 1 on).\n3. take 0 off \u2192 light off (only 1 on).\n4. put 0 back \u2192 light on (0 and 1 on).\n5. put 3 \u2192 light on (0,1,3 on).\n6. take 3 off \u2192 light on (0 and 1 on).\n\nSo currently, the machine has 0 and 1 on. The light is on. So the next step is to test other objects. Let's try adding object 2. If the light stays on, then 2 might be a non-blicket. If adding 2 causes the light to stay on (since 0 and 1 are already there), then the rule could be that having at least two blickets. But if adding 2 (non-blicket) doesn't affect, then that's okay. Alternatively, if 2 is a blicket, then adding it would make three, which if the rule is exactly two, then the light might turn off, but that's not observed here. But I need to test.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be present. So if there are three blickets (0,1,3), then all must be on. But that doesn't fit because when 3 was removed, the light stayed on. So that can't be.\n\nAnother angle: when I put object 0 on alone, it didn't work. Then adding 1 made it work. Then taking 0 off made it stop. So 0 and 1 are both needed. Then putting 0 back on makes it work again. So that suggests that both 0 and 1 are required. But what if the rule is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine requires both to be on? Then adding any others wouldn't matter, as long as both 0 and 1 are on. But when I added 3 and then removed it, the light stayed on because 0 and 1 were still there. That fits.\n\nBut what about object 2? If I put 2 on with 0 or 1, does the machine turn on? Let's test that. For example, take all off, put 0 and 2. If the light is off, then 2 isn't a blicket. If it's on, then 2 is a blicket. Similarly with 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but the user has limited steps. So I need to plan efficiently.\n\nCurrent state: objects on machine are 0 and 1. Light is on.\n\nNext steps: Maybe test if 2 is a blicket by itself. Take off 0 and 1, then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then it's not. But that would take several steps. Let's see:\n\nFirst, take 0 off. Then take 1 off. Then put 2 on. Then see if light is on. But that would require three steps. Alternatively, take 0 and 1 off together. But the commands are one at a time. So:\n\n> take object 0 off machine \u2192 light stays on? Wait, currently the machine has 0 and 1 on. If I take 0 off, then only 1 is on. Earlier, when 1 was alone, the light was off. So taking 0 off would turn the light off. Then take 1 off, put 2 on. If the light remains off, then 2 isn't a blicket. But that's three steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe leave 0 and 1 on, then add 2. If the light stays on, then 2 isn't a blicket (since the rule is that 0 and 1 are required). If adding 2 causes the light to stay on, that's expected. Then remove 0 and see if the light goes off. That's possible.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to test each object in combination with others. Since time is limited, perhaps check if object 2 is a blicket by combining it with one known blicket. For example, take 1 off (so only 0 is on \u2192 light off), then put 2 on. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket (since 0 + 2 would make two blickets if 2 is). But if the light remains off, then 2 isn't.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Take 1 off the machine. Now only 0 is on. Light should be off (as in previous steps when 0 was alone).\n2. Put 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket (so 0 and 2 are blickets). If not, then 2 is not.\n\nBut wait, if the rule is that at least two blickets are needed, then if 0 is a blicket and 2 isn't, then adding 2 wouldn't help. But if 2 is a blicket, then 0 and 2 would make two, turning it on.\n\nSo let's proceed with that.\n\nCurrent state: 0 and 1 are on, light on.\n\nTake 1 off:\n\n> take object 1 off machine \u2192 light off (since only 0 remains).\n\nThen put 2 on:\n\n> put object 2 on machine \u2192 light remains off (if 2 isn't a blicket) or turns on (if 2 is a blicket).\n\nBut this would take two steps. Alternatively, maybe take 0 off first, but that would require more steps.\n\nAlternatively, from current state (0 and 1 on, light on), take 0 off \u2192 light off (only 1 on). Then take 1 off \u2192 all off. Then put 2 on \u2192 if light turns on, 2 is a blicket. But that's three steps. But maybe more efficient.\n\nBut considering steps are limited, perhaps better to test 2 with 0 or 1. Let's try taking 1 off, leaving 0. Then add 2. If the light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then not.\n\nSo current step: take 1 off. Then put 2 on.\n\nAfter taking 1 off, the machine has 0 on. Light is off. Then adding 2. If the light turns on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. Otherwise, 2 is not.\n\nBut if the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be present, then even adding 2 wouldn't help. But earlier, when 0 and 1 were present, the light was on. But when 0 was alone, it was off. So maybe the rule requires both 0 and 1. But then why when we added 3, it stayed on. Because 0 and 1 were still there. So maybe the rule is that 0 and 1 are the only blickets, and the machine requires at least one of them. Wait, no. Because when 0 was alone, it was off. When 1 was alone, it was off. But together, it's on. So the rule could be that both 0 and 1 must be present. So the machine requires both to be on. Then adding any others doesn't matter, as long as both are on. So the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut then, when you added 3, the light stayed on because 0 and 1 were still there. Then removing 3, still on. So that fits. Then the other objects (2 and 3) are not blickets. But we need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if the sum of the blickets is even. But that seems more complicated. Let's stick with the simpler explanation.\n\nBut to confirm, let's test with object 2. Let's try adding 2 to the machine when only 0 is on (light off). If adding 2 turns it on, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then not.\n\nSo current state after previous steps: machine has 0 and 1 on, light on. Take 1 off \u2192 light off. Then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 2 isn't.\n\nSo next commands would be:\n\n> take object 1 off machine (light off)\n> put object 2 on machine \u2192 check light.\n\nIf the light remains off, then 2 is not a blicket. If it turns on, then 2 is a blicket. But according to the previous steps, when 0 was alone, it didn't work, but when 0 and 1 were together, it did. So if 2 is a blicket, then 0 and 2 would also turn it on. Let's see.\n\nAssuming I take 1 off, then put 2 on. If the light is still off, then 2 isn't a blicket. Then perhaps 0 and 1 are the only ones. Then I can check object 3 similarly.\n\nBut in the previous steps, when I put 3 on the machine (with 0 and 1 already there), the light stayed on. Then removing 3, it stayed on. So 3's presence didn't affect the state. So 3 is likely not a blicket. So the blickets are 0 and 1.\n\nBut to confirm, what if the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present, but only if another blicket is also present. So they need to be in pairs. But that's similar to needing two blickets.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine requires exactly two blickets, and 0 and 1 are the only ones. But then adding a third blicket would turn it off? But that wasn't tested.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But that contradicts the initial steps where 0 alone didn't turn it on. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present. But with 0 and 1 (two, even) it's on. If either is removed (1, odd) it's off. But that would fit. But then if there's a third blicket, adding it would make three (odd), which would turn it off. But when 3 was added, it stayed on, so 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to proceed with testing object 2.\n\nCurrent step: the user is to input the next command. After the last step (take 3 off), the machine has 0 and 1 on, light is on. So the next command should be to test object 2.\n\nOption 1: Take 0 off, then put 2 on.\n\nBut that's two steps. Let's see:\n\nTake 0 off \u2192 machine has 1. Light turns off (as before).\n\nThen put 2 on \u2192 machine has 1 and 2. If light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 2 is not.\n\nBut that would require two steps. Alternatively, leave 0 and 1 on, add 2. If light stays on, that's expected. Then remove 0 \u2192 light should turn off if the rule requires both 0 and 1. If removing 0 leaves 1 and 2, and the light stays on, then 2 must be a blicket. But this would take more steps.\n\nAlternatively, take 1 off first. Let's try that.\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nThis would leave object 0 on the machine. From previous steps, when only 0 is on, the light is off. Then put 2 on:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nIf the light turns on, then 0 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 2 isn't.\n\nAssuming the light remains off, then 2 isn't a blicket. Then I can check object 3 similarly. But in previous steps, when 3 was added and removed, it didn't affect the light (as long as 0 and 1 were present). So 3 is likely not a blicket.\n\nSo the possible blickets are 0 and 1. The rule is that both must be on the machine for it to activate. But to confirm, I need to test whether either 0 or 1 alone would activate it, which they don't. Which we've already seen.\n\nSo the next step is to take object 1 off to test 0 alone again. But that's already been done. Alternatively, check if object 2 is a blicket by combining with object 1.\n\nFor example, take 0 off (so only 1 is on \u2192 light off). Then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If not, then 2 isn't.\n\nBut that's also two steps. Alternatively, take both 0 and 1 off, then put 2 on. If light turns on, then 2 is a blicket. But that's three steps.\n\nGiven that steps are limited, perhaps the best approach is to confirm that 0 and 1 are the only blickets and the rule requires both. Since in all tests, when both are on, light is on; when either is off, light is off. Adding other objects doesn't affect as long as 0 and 1 are present. So the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on the machine. Therefore, the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both are placed on it.\n\nBut to ensure, let's try putting 2 on the machine with 0 and 1, and see if the light stays on. Then remove 0 and see if it turns off.\n\nSo current state: objects 0 and 1 are on, light is on.\n\nNext command: put object 2 on machine.\n\nIf the light remains on, that's expected. Then take 0 off. If light turns off, confirms that 0 and 1 are needed.\n\nBut this would take two steps. Let's do that.\n\n> put object 2 on machine \u2192 light stays on (since 0 and 1 are there).\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 0 off machine \u2192 light turns off (only 1 and 2 on).\n\nIf that's the case, then 0 is required. But this requires two steps. Since we have limited steps, but let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is supposed to output one command now, let's proceed with putting object 2 on the machine to see if it affects the light."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, here's what happened:\n\n1. When object 0 was placed alone on the machine, the light stayed off.\n2. Then adding object 1 turned the light on. So maybe object 1 is a blicket. But when object 0 was removed, the light turned off again. Wait, after putting object 0 back, the light came on. Hmm. Then adding object 3 kept the light on, but removing 3 didn't turn it off. Then adding object 2 also kept it on.\n\nWait, let's recap the steps:\n\n- After putting 0 on, light off. Then adding 1 turns it on. Then removing 0 turns it off. So when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. When 1 was added, it turned on. But then taking 0 off (leaving 1) turned it off again. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the steps say:\n\n> put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n> put object 1 on machine \u2192 light on.\n> take object 0 off \u2192 light off.\nSo, after putting 0 and 1 on, the machine is on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1 on the machine) makes the light turn off. That suggests that object 1 alone doesn't keep the machine on. Wait, but maybe there's a different rule. Maybe the machine requires at least two blickets? Because when 0 and 1 were on, it was on. Then when 0 was removed (only 1 left), it turned off. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 1 again) turned it on. Then adding 3 (now 0,1,3) kept it on. Taking 3 off (back to 0,1) still on. Then adding 2 (0,1,2) kept it on. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates if there are at least two blickets. But which objects are blickets?\n\nWait, let's see the individual objects:\n\nTesting each object alone:\n\n- Object 0 alone: light off.\n- Object 1 alone: When object 0 was removed, leaving 1, light went off. So 1 alone doesn't activate. Wait, but when you put 0 and 1 together, it turned on. Then removing 0 made it off. So if 0 is not a blicket, then adding 1 (a blicket) with 0 (non-blicket) turned it on. That would imply that the rule isn't just having any blicket. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates if the sum of blickets meets a certain condition, like even number or something. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. Let's see:\n\nWhen 0 and 1 are on, machine on. Then taking 0 off (only 1) \u2192 off. So maybe 0 and 1 together activate, but individually they don't. So perhaps both 0 and 1 are blickets. But then when adding 3 to 0 and 1, machine stays on. If 3 is a non-blicket, then the presence of two blickets (0 and 1) would still activate. Then adding 2 (assuming it's non-blicket) would still keep it on. But then when taking 3 off (so 0,1,2), still on. But if 2 is a blicket, then 0,1,2 would be three blickets. If the rule is at least two, then that works. But how to determine which are blickets.\n\nWait, let's test each object alone. Maybe the initial steps didn't test all. Let's check:\n\n- Object 0 alone: Put on machine \u2192 light off. So 0 is not a blicket?\n- Object 1 alone: After putting 0 and 1, then take 0 off. The light turns off. So 1 alone \u2192 off. So 1 is not a blicket? But that contradicts because when both 0 and 1 were on, the machine turned on. So if neither 0 nor 1 is a blicket, how did that happen? That can't be. So maybe the rule isn't additive. Maybe it's a specific combination. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present. But let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: when 0 and 1 are on, machine on. Then when 0 is removed, machine off. So machine requires both 0 and 1. But then when 0 is put back (so 0 and 1), machine on. Then adding 3 (so 0,1,3) \u2192 still on. Taking 3 off (0 and 1) \u2192 on. Adding 2 (0,1,2) \u2192 on. So maybe the rule is that the machine is on as long as 0 and 1 are both on, regardless of others. But then why when adding 3 and 2 does it stay on? Because 0 and 1 are still there. But then 3 and 2 might not be blickets. But then the rule would be that the machine activates if both 0 and 1 are present. But how do we know if those are the blickets? Or maybe 0 and 1 are both blickets and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Wait, but in the initial steps, when 0 and 1 were on, machine on. Then when 0 was removed, machine off. So if all blickets must be on, then 0 and 1 would both be blickets. Because if even one is missing, the machine turns off. But then when adding 3 and 2, they would not affect the machine as long as 0 and 1 are present. But when 3 was added, the machine stayed on. So that fits. Then the blickets would be 0 and 1, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. However, when 3 was added and then removed, the machine stayed on. So if the rule is all blickets must be on, then adding non-blickets doesn't affect. But when 0 and 1 are on, adding 3 (non-blicket) doesn't change anything. Then removing 3 (non-blicket) also doesn't change. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) doesn't affect. So the machine remains on as long as 0 and 1 are on. That would fit. Then the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But wait, when we first put 0 on alone, the machine was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So if both 0 and 1 are required, then that's the rule. So the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all blickets (which are 0 and 1) are on the machine. Then, in that case, the other objects (2 and 3) don't matter. But how do we confirm?\n\nBut then when 0 and 1 are on, adding 3 (non-blicket) \u2192 machine stays on. Then removing 3 \u2192 machine stays on. Then adding 2 \u2192 machine stays on. So all that matters is that 0 and 1 are present. But wait, when 0 was put on the machine first alone, machine off. Then adding 1 \u2192 on. So that suggests that both 0 and 1 are needed. So they are both blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be present. But then in another scenario, maybe if there are more blickets. Wait, but there are only 4 objects. Let me check the steps again:\n\nAfter putting 0 and 1 on, machine on. Then removing 0 \u2192 machine off. Putting 0 back \u2192 on. Then adding 3 \u2192 on. Taking 3 off \u2192 on. Adding 2 \u2192 on. So the presence of 0 and 1 is sufficient. So the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be on the machine, and the others don't matter. Therefore, they are the blickets. But wait, what if the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine is even? Let's see:\n\nIf 0 and 1 are blickets, putting both (even) \u2192 on. If either is removed (odd), off. Then adding another blicket (say 2 or 3) would change the parity. But in the current steps, when 0 and 1 are on (even), adding 3 (assuming it's a non-blicket) \u2192 even (still 2 blickets) \u2192 on. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) \u2192 still even. But if 2 was a blicket, then adding 2 would make 3 blickets (odd) \u2192 machine off. But in the steps, adding 2 kept it on. So 2 is not a blicket. So perhaps the rule is that exactly two blickets (0 and 1) must be present. Alternatively, the rule is that all blickets must be present. Let me think.\n\nIf the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then the blickets would be 0 and 1. So whenever both are on, regardless of others, the machine is on. If either is missing, it's off. That fits the observed behavior. So the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But to confirm, I should test if removing 1 while others are on would turn it off. Let's see the current state: objects 0, 1, 2 are on the machine. The machine is on. If I take 1 off, what happens? According to previous steps, when 0 and 1 were on, removing 0 turned it off. So if I take 1 off now (leaving 0 and 2 on), the machine should turn off. Let's test that.\n\nBut I need to choose a command. The user is asking me to output the next command. The current state has objects 0,1,2,3 on the machine? Wait, no. Let me check the step-by-step again:\n\nThe last command was \"put object 2 on machine\" which turned the light on. So prior to that, after taking 3 off, the machine had 0 and 1 on. Then adding 2 \u2192 0,1,2 on. So now the machine has 0,1,2. The light is on. So if I take 1 off, leaving 0 and 2, does the light turn off? Because if the rule is that both 0 and 1 are required, then removing 1 should turn it off. So the next step could be taking 1 off to test this.\n\nBut the user wants to complete the task efficiently. Let's see: if I take 1 off, and the light turns off, that would confirm that 1 is a blicket and needed. If the light stays on, then perhaps another rule. So maybe the next command is \"take object 1 off machine\". Let's do that."}

But when I removed object 1, the light turned off, even though objects 0, 2, and 3 were on.\n\nHmm, this suggests that object 1 is critical. When object 1 is on the machine, the light stays on. But when it's removed, even with others on, the light goes off. Let's check the steps again:\n\n1. Put 0 on: light off.\n2. Add 1: light on. So either 1 is a blicket, or the combination of 0 and 1.\n3. Take 0 off: light off. So 0 was part of the activation when 1 was on? Wait, maybe when 1 is present, adding 0 activates it, but removing 0 deactivates. But then when I put 0 back on, the light turns on again. So with 0 and 1 on, it's on. Then adding 3 and 2, it stays on. But when I remove 1, even with 0, 2, 3 on, the light goes off. That implies that object 1 is necessary. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present, and object 1 is a blicket. But why did putting 0 and 1 on first work, but then when adding 0 again later with 1, it worked?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the steps step by step:\n\n- After putting 0 on: light off.\n- Put 1 on: light on. So 1 might be a blicket. Then, removing 0 (leaving 1) makes the light off. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, no. The third step is taking object 0 off the machine after putting 0 and 1 on. So after putting 0 and 1 on, the machine is on. Taking 0 off (leaving 1 on) caused the light to turn off. But that would mean that 1 alone isn't enough, which contradicts the earlier idea. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again:\n\nFirst action: put 0 on machine. Light off. So 0 alone doesn't activate.\n\nSecond action: put 1 on. Now machine has 0 and 1. Light turns on. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets. Then, when you take 0 off (leaving 1), the light turns off. So 1 alone doesn't activate it. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 1 again) turns it on. Then adding 3 (now 0,1,3 on) keeps it on. Then remove 3 (back to 0 and 1) still on. Then add 2 (0,1,2 on) still on. Then take 1 off (0 and 2 on) light turns off. \n\nWait, so when 0 and 1 are both on, the machine is on. When 1 is removed (even with 0 and 2), it's off. But when 0 and 1 are on, adding 3 and 2 doesn't affect it. Then taking 1 off turns it off. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 need to be on the machine for it to activate. Because whenever both are present, it's on, and if either is removed, it turns off. But then when adding 3 and 2, the presence of 0 and 1 keeps it on. Then when 1 is taken off, even with 0,2,3 on, it's off. So the rule might be that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be present. But then why did putting 0 on again after taking it off (step 4) turn the light on again when 1 was already on? Wait, step 3: after taking 0 off (leaving 1 on), the light was off. Then step 4: putting 0 back on (so 0 and 1) turns it on again. That makes sense if both are required.\n\nBut then, when adding 3 and 2, the machine stays on. Because 0 and 1 are still there. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires at least objects 0 and 1 to be present. So they are both blickets. But then, if the machine is on when both are present regardless of others. Then objects 2 and 3 may not be blickets. But let's see another test: when 0,1,3 are on, removing 3 doesn't affect the light. So 3 isn't necessary. Similarly, adding 2 doesn't affect it. So the presence of 0 and 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, in the last step, after putting 2 on (so objects 0,1,2,3 on the machine), taking 1 off leaves 0,2,3 on, and the light turns off. So that supports the idea that both 0 and 1 are required. But when 0 was first put on alone, the light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. Taking 0 off (leaving 1) turned it off. Then putting 0 back on (so 0 and 1) turned it on again. So the machine's activation depends on both 0 and 1 being present. Therefore, both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates only when both are on it. But wait, in step 5, when object 3 was added (so 0,1,3), the light stayed on. Then when 3 was removed, it stayed on. So 3's presence didn't matter. Similarly, adding 2 didn't affect it. So the rule must be that the machine activates when both 0 and 1 are on, regardless of others. So those two are the blickets.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. What if the rule is that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present? Or some other combination. But the evidence so far seems to point to 0 and 1 being required together. Let's see: when only 0 is on, no. Only 1 is on, no. Both on, yes. Adding others doesn't change that. So the rule could be that both 0 and 1 must be present. Therefore, they are blickets, and the others are not. But how to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. Suppose 0,1,2 are blickets. Then putting 0 and 1 would activate it, as two blickets. Adding 2 (third blicket) would still keep it on. But when taking 1 off, you have 0 and 2, two blickets, so the light should stay on. But in the last step, after taking 1 off (leaving 0,2 on the machine), the light turned off. So that would contradict that. Therefore, 0 and 1 must be the only blickets, and the rule is that both must be present.\n\nAnother possible rule: the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. But if 0 and 1 are the only blickets, then adding more non-blickets (like 2 and 3) would still keep the count at two blickets, so the machine stays on. But in that case, if the rule is exactly two, then removing one (like taking 1 off) would leave one blicket (0), so the machine turns off. That fits with the observations. But the rule could also be \"at least two\", but if 0 and 1 are the only blickets, then adding non-blickets doesn't affect the count. But the problem is that when 0 and 1 are on, adding 2 and 3 (non-blickets) keeps the count at two, which would still satisfy \"exactly two\" or \"at least two\".\n\nBut according to the steps, when only 0 and 1 are on, the machine is on. When adding 2 and 3 (non-blickets), it's still on. Then taking 1 off leaves 0, 2, 3. If 0 is a blicket, and others are not, then the count is 1, which would turn the machine off. So that fits. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, but that doesn't fit with the initial steps. Because when 0 was on alone, it didn't activate. So the rule must require that both 0 and 1 are present. Therefore, the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine for it to activate.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility: maybe the machine activates when any blicket is present, but 0 is not a blicket. Because when 0 was alone, the machine was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1) turned it off. That would mean that 1 is a blicket but only works when 0 is present. Wait, that's more complicated. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates if an odd number of blickets are present. If 1 is a blicket and 0 is not, then putting 1 on would make the count 1 (odd) and activate. But when 0 and 1 are on (assuming 1 is a blicket, 0 not), the count is 1 (still odd). Then taking 0 off leaves 1, which is odd. So why did the light turn off when 0 was taken off after having 0 and 1 on? That contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, if 1 is a blicket and 0 is not. Then when 1 is on alone, it activates. But in the initial steps, putting 0 on first (light off), then adding 1 (light on). Then taking 0 off (leaving 1) would make the light stay on. But according to the steps, after taking 0 off, the light turned off. So that's a problem. Therefore, 1 alone isn't sufficient. So that suggests that 1 is not a blicket by itself, but perhaps needs to be combined with 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. Suppose there are two blickets: 0 and 1. Then whenever both are on, the machine is on. If any are missing, it's off. Adding other objects doesn't matter. That fits the observations. Because when 0 and 1 are on, it's on. Adding 2 and 3 (non-blickets) doesn't affect. Taking 1 off (leaving 0,2,3) turns it off. Taking 0 off (leaving 1,2,3) also turns it off. So the rule is that both 0 and 1 must be present. Therefore, they are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. So the answer would be blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present, but 0 and 1 are both blickets. So when either is present, it should activate. But in the first step, putting 0 alone didn't activate. So that can't be. Therefore, the rule must require both 0 and 1. So the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut wait, what if there's another combination. Let's test with putting 2 and 3 on. For example, if I put 2 on alone. Let's see. The user hasn't tried that yet. The previous steps didn't test putting 2 or 3 alone. Maybe that's necessary. But the user has a limited number of steps. Let me think: in the current state, after the last action (take object 1 off machine), the machine has objects 0, 2 on? Or wait, let's check the sequence again:\n\nAfter the last command, after taking object 1 off, the machine has 0, 2, 3 on? Wait, let me retrace the steps:\n\n1. put 0 on: machine has 0. Light off.\n2. put 1 on: machine has 0,1. Light on.\n3. take 0 off: machine has 1. Light off.\n4. put 0 on: machine has 0,1. Light on.\n5. put 3 on: machine has 0,1,3. Light on.\n6. take 3 off: machine has 0,1. Light on.\n7. put 2 on: machine has 0,1,2. Light on.\n8. take 1 off: machine has 0,2. Light off.\n\nSo after step 8, objects 0 and 2 are on the machine. The light is off. So putting 2 on with 0 and 1 didn't affect it. Taking 1 off leaves 0 and 2. Light off. So 0 and 2 together don't activate. So 2 is not a blicket. Similarly, what about putting 3 on alone? Let's test that. But the user hasn't done that yet. Maybe the next step is to put 2 on alone to see.\n\nBut given the step limit, I should check if there's a way to confirm. Let's see. If the current state is machine has 0 and 2 on (light off). If I take 0 off, leaving 2. Then put 2 alone. If light remains off, then 2 is not a blicket. Similarly for 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets, but the user hasn't tested other combinations. For example, if 1 and 3 are blickets. But when 0,1,3 were on, the light was on. Then removing 3, leaving 0 and 1, the light stayed on. If the rule requires exactly two, then that would mean that 0 and 1 are the two. Because when 3 is added (so three blickets?), but removing 3 didn't affect. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present, but the blickets are 1 and 3. Let's see. When 0 and 1 are on, the light is on (if 1 is a blicket). Then taking 0 off leaves 1, which should keep the light on, but in step 3, the light turned off. So that's a contradiction. So 1 can't be a blicket if the rule is \"any blicket present\".\n\nSo the most consistent explanation is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present on the machine. The other objects (2 and 3) are not blickets. \n\nTo confirm, perhaps the next step is to put 1 back on the machine (current state has 0 and 2 on, light off). If putting 1 on makes the light turn on, then that supports the rule. Let's see:\n\nCurrent objects on the machine: 0 and 2. Light off. \n\nIf I put 1 on, then the machine has 0,1,2. According to previous steps, when 0,1,2 were on, the light was on. So adding 1 now should turn it on. Then take 0 off, leaving 1 and 2. If the light stays on, then 1 is a blicket and the rule is at least one. But earlier steps contradict that. Alternatively, if taking 0 off (leaving 1 and 2) turns the light off, then it's because 0 and 1 are required. So let's try:\n\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nIf the light turns on, that suggests that 0 and 1 together are needed. Because previously, when 0 and 1 were on, it was on. Now adding 1 to 0 and 2 (so 0,1,2) should turn it on again. Then taking 0 off (leaving 1,2) would turn it off again. That would confirm that 0 is needed. Alternatively, maybe the presence of 1 and 2 is sufficient. But given previous steps, when 0,1,2 were on, it was on. Taking 1 off (leaving 0,2) turned it off. So putting 1 back on should turn it on again. \n\nBut since I'm supposed to output the next command, perhaps the user needs to test this. But given the step limit, maybe it's better to conclude now. However, perhaps there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the total number of blickets is odd. If there are two blickets (even), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe the sum of their IDs. But that's complicated. \n\nAnother angle: when object 1 is present, the machine activates if another object (like 0) is also present. So the rule is that 1 must be present along with at least one other object. But when 1 and 0 are on, it works. When 1 is alone, it doesn't. Then when 1 is present with 2 or 3, does it work? For example, if 1 and 2 are on. Let's say the user hasn't tested that. If they put 1 and 2 on, and the light is on, then the rule might be that 1 plus any other object. But the previous steps show that with 1 and 0 on, it's on. Taking 0 off (leaving 1) turns it off. Putting 0 back on (1 and 0) turns it on. Then adding 3 (1,0,3) keeps it on. Removing 3 (1,0) keeps it on. Adding 2 (1,0,2) keeps it on. Removing 1 (0,2) turns it off. So if the rule is that 1 plus any other object, then putting 1 and 2 on should activate the machine. But we don't have data on that yet. \n\nSo to test that, the user could take all objects off except 1 and 2 and see. But that would take several steps. Given the step limit, maybe it's better to infer based on existing data. \n\nThe most parsimonious explanation is that both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the machine activates only when both are present. The other objects (2 and 3) are not blickets. \n\nTherefore, the next step could be to confirm this by putting 1 back on the machine (since currently, the machine has 0 and 2 on, light off). If adding 1 makes it light up, then taking 0 off would turn it off again. \n\nSo the next command would be to put object 1 on the machine."}

Let me start by recalling the interactions so far.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then adding object 1 made it turn on. So maybe object 1 is a blicket. But then when I took object 0 off, the light turned off again. Wait, but when I put object 0 back on with object 1 still there (assuming?), the light came on again. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Wait, let me check the steps again.\n\nAfter putting object 0 on, light off. Then adding object 1 made it on. Then taking object 0 off caused the light to turn off. So when only object 1 was on, did the light stay on? Wait, no. Because when I took object 0 off, the machine turned off. Wait, that would suggest that object 1 alone isn't sufficient. But then later when I put object 0 back on again (with object 1 still on?), the light came on again. Wait, but maybe I need to track the exact sequence.\n\nLet me re-examine the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on: light off.\n2. Put 1 on: light on. So with 0 and 1 on, light is on. Then take 0 off: light off. So removing 0 (leaving 1) causes light off. That suggests that 0 is needed? But when 0 was alone, it didn't work. So maybe both 0 and 1 are required? But then when I later put 0 back on (assuming 1 was still there?), the light came on. Wait, but after taking 0 off, then putting 0 back on, the machine would have 0 and 1 again, so light on. Then adding 3, light stayed on. Then removing 3, light stayed on. Then adding 2, light stayed on. Then taking 1 off, light turned off. So when 1 is removed, even with 0, 2, and 3 on, the light turns off. That suggests that object 1 is critical. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, but object 1 is a blicket. Wait, but when I had 1 on the machine alone (after putting 0 and 1 on, then taking 0 off), the light turned off. Wait, that contradicts that. Because if 1 alone is a blicket, then removing 0 would leave 1, which should keep the light on. But in the step after taking 0 off, the light turned off. So that suggests that 1 alone isn't sufficient. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 1 need to be present? But when I later added 3 and 2, the light stayed on even when 0 was there with 1. Then taking 1 off caused the light to turn off. Wait, let me retrace the steps again:\n\n- After putting 0 and 1 on, light on.\n- Take 0 off: light off. So only 1 on machine: light off.\n- Put 0 back on (now 0 and 1 on machine): light on.\n- Put 3 on (now 0,1,3 on machine): light remains on.\n- Take 3 off (0,1 remain): light on.\n- Put 2 on (0,1,2 on): light on.\n- Take 1 off (0,2 on): light turns off.\n- Put 1 back on: light on.\n\nSo when 1 is present, the light is on, regardless of other objects. But when 1 is removed, even with others, the light is off. That suggests that object 1 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket (object 1) to be on. But why did putting 0 and 1 initially turn it on, then removing 0 turned it off? Because when you take 0 off, leaving only 1, the light should stay on if 1 is a blicket. But in the earlier step, taking 0 off caused the light to turn off. That contradicts. Unless maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be on. If object 1 is the only blicket, then putting 1 on alone should turn it on. But when I first put 0 on, then 1, the light turned on. Then taking 0 off left only 1, but the light turned off. That would suggest that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. But then why when I put 0 back on (with 1 still on?), the light came on again. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me check again:\n\n1. put 0 on: light off.\n2. put 1 on: light on. So 0 and 1 on.\n3. take 0 off: light off. So only 1 on.\n4. put 0 back on: now 0 and 1 again. Light on.\n5. put 3 on: now 0,1,3. Light on.\n6. take 3 off: 0 and 1 left. Light on.\n7. put 2 on: 0,1,2. Light on.\n8. take 1 off: 0 and 2 on. Light off.\n9. put 1 back on: 0,1,2. Light on.\n\nSo the key observations here are:\n\n- When 0 and 1 are both on, light is on.\n- When only 1 is on (step 3 after taking 0 off), light is off.\n- When 1 is removed (step 8), even with 0 and 2 on, light is off.\n- When 1 is added back (step 9), light is on.\n\nThis suggests that object 1 is necessary, but not sufficient. The machine requires at least object 1 and another object (maybe 0?). Wait, but in step 4, putting 0 back on with 1 already there made it on. But then in step 5, adding 3 also kept it on. Then taking 3 off didn't affect. Then adding 2, still on. Then taking 1 off made it off, even with 0 and 2 on. So maybe the rule is that object 1 must be present, and at least one other object. So the machine requires object 1 plus any other object. But when we added 3 and 2, they didn't interfere. Let's see:\n\nWhen 0 and 1 are on: light on. Adding 3: still on. So maybe the rule is that if object 1 is on the machine along with any other object(s), the light turns on. But when only object 1 is on, it's off. So the machine requires object 1 and at least one other object. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn step 3, after taking 0 off, only object 1 is on the machine. Light is off. So that fits. When object 1 is alone, light off. When object 1 is with any other object (0, 2, 3), light on. So the rule could be: the machine turns on when object 1 and at least one other object are present. Then, the blickets would be object 1 and possibly others, but maybe only object 1 is a blicket but requires another object to activate. Wait, but the initial problem states that blickets make the machine turn on. So the presence of a blicket is necessary and sufficient? Or perhaps the rule is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets, which are objects 1 and 0. But when I added 3 and 2, the light stayed on. So if the rule is that at least two blickets must be on, but objects 0 and 1 are blickets, then when you have 0 and 1, it's on. Adding 3 (non-blicket) doesn't affect. But when you take 1 off, even with 0 and 2, since 2 isn't a blicket, the light turns off. But in that case, the blickets would be 0 and 1. But in the first step, putting 0 alone didn't turn it on. So that would require that both 0 and 1 must be present. But then when I added 3 and 2, the light stayed on because 0 and 1 were still there. Then taking 1 off leaves 0 and 2 (but 0 is a blicket and 2 isn't), but the light turns off. So that would suggest that the machine needs at least two blickets. But if only 0 is a blicket, then even with others, it's not enough. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but only object 1 is a blicket. But when object 1 is alone, the light was off. That contradicts that. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are present. If the blickets are 0 and 1, then when both are on, it's on. If either is missing, it's off. Let's see:\n\n- 0 and 1 on: light on. Adding others doesn't matter. Taking either 0 or 1 off turns it off. That fits the steps. Then when 0,1,3 are on, removing 3 doesn't affect. But when you take 1 off, even with 0, light off. So the rule would be that the machine requires both 0 and 1 to be on. But then why when we added 3 and 2, the light stayed on? Because 0 and 1 were still there. But when you take 1 off, the light goes off. So that would make 0 and 1 the blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. But initially, when 0 was alone, it didn't turn on. Then adding 1 made it on. That fits. So perhaps the rule is that all blickets must be present. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, the machine requires both to be on. Then, when they are both on, adding other objects (non-blickets) doesn't matter. But when either is removed, the light turns off. That seems to fit the observations.\n\nBut then, in the step where I put object 0 back on after taking it off, the light turned on again. So if 0 and 1 are both on, light on. Then, when I added 3, it stayed on. Then removing 3 didn't affect. Then adding 2, still on. Then removing 1, light off. So the presence of 0 and 1 is necessary and sufficient. So the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine. Then any other objects don't affect. That would explain all the steps.\n\nBut wait, when I put object 3 on the machine (when 0 and 1 were already on), the light stayed on. Then taking 3 off didn't affect. So the presence of non-blickets (3, 2) doesn't influence the machine. Only the presence of the blickets (0 and 1) matters. So the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both 0 and 1 are on it. Then, if either is removed, it turns off. But then, what about the step where I put object 0 on alone first, and it didn't turn on. Then adding 1 turned it on. Then taking 0 off turned it off. Then putting 0 back on (with 1 still there) turned it on again. That all fits. Then adding 3 and 2 doesn't affect. Then taking 1 off turns it off. So yes, that makes sense. So the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be present.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: maybe the machine requires at least two blickets. If 0,1, and 3 are blickets, then putting any two would turn it on. But in the initial steps, putting 0 alone didn't work. Then adding 1 made it work. So if 0 and 1 are blickets, then two blickets are needed. But when 0 is alone, one isn't enough. Then when you have 0 and 1, it's on. Then adding 3 (non-blicket) doesn't change. Taking 3 off, still on. Then adding 2 (non-blicket) still on. Then taking 1 off leaves only 0 and 2 (non-blicket), so only one blicket (0), so light off. Then putting 1 back (now 0,1,2) has two blickets (0 and 1), so light on. That would require that the rule is that the machine needs at least two blickets. But then, if 0 and 1 are blickets, putting both on would satisfy the rule. But when you take 0 off, leaving 1 (a blicket alone), the light turns off. So the rule would require at least two blickets. So in that case, the blickets are 0,1, and maybe others. But in the steps, when adding 3, the light stays on. But if 3 is a non-blicket, then adding it to 0 and 1 (two blickets) would still have two, so light remains on. Then when taking 3 off, still two. So that's possible. But in that case, the step where I took 1 off left 0 and 2 (assuming 2 is a non-blicket), so only one blicket (0), so light off. Then adding 1 back gives two, so light on. That fits. But how to confirm if there are more blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. But then, when adding a third (if 3 is a blicket), it would still be on. But without knowing if 3 is a blicket, this is hard. But in the given steps, when I put 3 on the machine (with 0 and 1 already there), the light stayed on. Then taking 3 off didn't affect. So maybe 3 isn't a blicket. Similarly, when I put 2 on, light stayed on. So if the rule is at least two blickets, and 0 and 1 are the only blickets, then adding non-blickets doesn't affect. That would fit.\n\nBut how to test if there are other blickets. For example, maybe object 2 is also a blicket. Let's see: when I added object 2 to the machine (with 0,1 already on), the light stayed on. Then when I took 1 off, leaving 0 and 2, the light turned off. If 2 were a blicket, then 0 and 2 would be two blickets, so the light should stay on. But it turned off. So 2 is not a blicket. Similarly, when I added 3, the light stayed on. If 3 were a blicket, then with 0,1,3 on, that's three blickets. Then taking 3 off would leave two, so light stays on. Which is what happened. So if 3 were a blicket, removing it would still have two, so light on. But when I took 3 off, the light stayed on. So that's possible. But when I took 1 off, leaving 0 and 2 (assuming 2 is not a blicket), then only 0 remains, so light off. That fits if 0 and 1 are the only blickets.\n\nBut let's consider another test: what if I put 2 on the machine alone. If the light is off, then 2 is not a blicket. But I haven't done that yet. In the steps, I put 2 on when 0,1 were already there. Then after taking 1 off, the light turned off. But I haven't tested 2 alone. So maybe I should test that.\n\nBut according to the steps taken so far, the user hasn't tested putting 2 or 3 alone on the machine. So perhaps the next step is to test if object 2 alone activates the machine. For example, take all objects off, then put 2 on. If the light doesn't turn on, then 2 isn't a blicket. Similarly for 3.\n\nBut in the current state, the machine has objects 0, 1, and 2 on. The light is on. If I take 0 and 1 off, leaving only 2, and the light turns off, then 2 isn't a blicket. Let me check the available steps. The user has 32 steps, but they have used 9 so far. So they have more steps left. However, maybe they can deduce based on existing info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires object 1 to be present, and any other object (regardless of which). Because when 1 is present with 0, light on. When 1 is present with 0 and 3, light on. When 1 is present with 0,2,3, light on. When 1 is removed, light off. But when 1 is alone, light is off. So the rule would be: machine turns on if object 1 is present and at least one other object (regardless of which). So object 1 is a blicket, but requires another object (could be non-blicket) to activate. That's possible. But then why does adding any other object with 1 work? For example, putting 1 and 2 on would turn it on. But in the current steps, the user hasn't tested that. But in the steps, when they took 1 off (leaving 0 and 2), the light went off. So if the rule is 1 plus any other, then putting 1 and 2 on should turn it on. But they haven't tested that yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two objects, and one of them is a blicket. But this seems less likely given the steps.\n\nAnother angle: when the user put 0 on alone, the light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So 0 and 1 together make it on. Then putting 0 back on (with 1) turns it on again. Adding 3 (non-blicket) doesn't affect. Then taking 3 off, still on. Adding 2 (non-blicket) still on. Then removing 1 (leaving 0 and 2) turns it off. Then adding 1 back turns it on. So the presence of 1 seems crucial. So maybe the rule is that object 1 must be present, and at least one other object. The other object can be any, including non-blickets. So object 1 is a blicket, and the machine requires it plus any other object. So the blickets are just 1, but the machine needs 1 and another (any) object. But why would the machine require another object if it's not a blicket? That seems odd. But according to the problem statement, the machine's rule is based on blickets. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Then, if object 1 is a blicket, then putting it alone should turn it on. But in the steps, when the user put 1 on alone (after removing 0), the light turned off. That contradicts. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be present. If there are multiple blickets, all must be on the machine. For example, if 0 and 1 are blickets, then both must be on. If there's only one blicket, then that one must be on. But how do we know how many blickets there are? The problem says \"some\" of the objects are blickets. So there could be 1 or more.\n\nIn the current steps, the only time the machine turned on was when 0 and 1 were present together. Then adding others didn't affect. But when either 0 or 1 was removed, the light turned off. That suggests that both 0 and 1 are necessary. So they must both be blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be present. But how many blickets are there? If 0 and 1 are the only blickets, then the rule is that both must be present. That fits. Then, even if other objects are added or removed, as long as 0 and 1 are there, the light stays on. If either is removed, the light goes off. This seems to fit all the observations.\n\nBut how to confirm that there aren't other blickets. For example, maybe object 3 is also a blicket. If the rule is all blickets must be present, then if 0,1,3 are blickets, then all three must be on. But in the steps, when 0 and 1 were on, adding 3 didn't turn it off. So if 3 is a blicket, then the machine would require all three to be present, but adding 3 didn't turn it off. Wait, no: if the rule is that all blickets must be present, then if you add a new blicket (3), the machine would turn off if not all are present. But in this case, when 0 and 1 were on, adding 3 (a blicket) would mean that now three blickets are present, but the machine would require all three. But the light stayed on. So that contradicts. Therefore, 3 cannot be a blicket. Therefore, the blickets are only 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis. If the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is both must be present, then:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n- 1 alone: off.\n- 0 and 1: on.\n- 0,1, and any others: on.\n- Remove either 0 or 1: off.\n\nWhich matches all the steps. Therefore, the blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine.\n\nBut wait, when the user put object 0 on, then object 1, the light turned on. Then they took object 0 off, light turned off. Then put object 0 back on, light on. Then added 3, light on. Then removed 3, light on. Then added 2, light on. Then removed 1, light off. Then added 1 back, light on. So yes, this all fits the rule that both 0 and 1 must be present.\n\nBut how to confirm that objects 2 and 3 aren't blickets. For example, if I put 2 on alone, and the light stays off, then it's not a blicket. Similarly for 3. But in the steps, the user hasn't done that. However, based on the existing steps, when 3 was added to 0 and 1, the light stayed on. If 3 were a blicket, then the rule (all blickets must be present) would require that 3 is also on. But when they took 3 off, the light remained on. Therefore, 3 cannot be a blicket. Similarly, adding 2 didn't require it to stay on. Therefore, 2 and 3 are not blickets.\n\nSo the conclusion is that blickets are 0 and 1, and the rule is that both must be on the machine for it to turn on."}
