The key is to test different combinations of placing these objects on the machine and see when the light turns on.\n\nFirst, maybe I should test each object individually. Let's try putting one object on the machine at a time and check if the machine activates. If an object alone doesn't work, then maybe the rule requires multiple objects. Or perhaps there's a specific condition, like certain objects together or a particular order.\n\nSo, let's start with object 0. I'll put it on the machine. If the light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or maybe needs another object. Then repeat with each object one by one. But if none work alone, I'll need to test pairs. Let's see.\n\nWait, but I have limited steps (32), so efficiency is key. Maybe testing pairs first would be better if the rule is based on combinations. But without knowing, starting with individual tests is logical.\n\nLet's do the first step: put object 0 on the machine. Then check the status with 'look' to see if the machine's light is on. If it's on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, remove it and try the next one."}
