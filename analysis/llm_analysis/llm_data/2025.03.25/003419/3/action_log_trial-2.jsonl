Wait, the message says the machine's light is now on, but then it turns off. That's confusing. Maybe there's a time delay, or maybe the machine only activates when certain conditions are met. Let me check again. The current state is object 0 on the machine, others on the floor. The light is off now. Hmm. Maybe putting object 0 alone isn't enough, or perhaps the machine activates momentarily but doesn't stay on. Alternatively, maybe the rule isn't just having a single blicket. Let's try adding another object. Maybe object 0 is a blicket but needs another one. Let's try adding object 1 next to object 0 on the machine.\n\nSo, next command: put object 1 on the machine.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nThe machine's light turns on. \n\nThe machine's light is currently on.

This suggests that having both might activate it. But earlier, when I put object 0 alone, the light turned on and then off. Wait, maybe the machine's state updates when actions are taken. Let me think. When I first put object 0, the light turned on, but then the next step it was off. But when I added object 1, the light is on now. Maybe the machine checks the current state each time an object is placed. So perhaps the combination of 0 and 1 activates it. But maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is present, but there's more to it. Alternatively, the rule could be that two specific objects are needed. Let's try removing one to see. For example, take object 0 off and see if the light stays on. If it turns off, then maybe both are needed. So next command: take object 0 off the machine.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> take object 0 off the machine\n\nThe machine's light turns off. \n\nThe machine's light is currently off.

So object 1 alone on the machine doesn't keep it on. But when both 0 and 1 were on, it was on. So maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule requires all blickets to be on the machine. Wait, but how many blickets are there? Let's test if other combinations work. For example, put object 1 and 2 on the machine. Let's first take object 1 off (since it's currently on) and then try 1 and 2. Wait, but maybe I should test each object individually first to see their effect. Let's check object 1 alone. Currently, object 1 is on the machine, but the light is off. Wait, earlier when I put object 1 on after 0, the light was on. But when I removed 0, leaving 1, the light went off. That suggests that object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, but 1 isn't. Wait, but when I put 0 first, the light turned on but then off. Maybe the machine only activates when a new object is placed. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present, but there's a cooldown. Hmm. Let me retest object 0 alone. Put object 0 back on the machine. Let's see what happens.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\nThe machine's light turns on. \n\nThe machine's light is currently on.
