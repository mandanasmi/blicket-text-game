Let's start by understanding the current setup. The machine is off right now. The objects are numbered 0 to 7. Currently, object 1 is on the machine, and the rest are on the floor. The machine is off. Hmm, so maybe having object 1 alone isn't enough to activate it. Or maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Let me test this first.\n\nWait, the machine's light is off even though object 1 is on it. So if object 1 were a blicket, maybe the machine would be on. But it's not. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Or maybe the rule requires more than one blicket. Alternatively, maybe the rule is different, like the number of blickets needs to be even, or specific combinations.\n\nFirst step: check if object 1 is a blicket. Since it's on the machine and the machine is off, maybe removing it and seeing if the machine turns on when other objects are added. Wait, but maybe the presence of a blicket is necessary. But in this case, the machine is off. So perhaps object 1 isn't a blicket. Let's try adding another object to the machine with object 1. But maybe first, remove object 1 to see if the machine stays off. If removing it doesn't change anything, then maybe it's not a blicket. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. But since object 1 is on the machine and it's off, that would mean object 1 isn't a blicket. But perhaps the rule is more complex. Let's start by taking object 1 off the machine and see what happens. If the machine remains off, that doesn't tell us much. But if it turns on when we add another object, that could help.\n\nWait, the initial state is object 1 on the machine and the machine is off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Let's try putting another object on the machine. Let's pick object 0. So, put object 0 on the machine. Then check if the machine turns on. If it does, then either 0 is a blicket or 1 wasn't, but combined they might have some effect. But since object 1 was already on the machine and adding 0 didn't change the state (if the machine remains off), then maybe neither are blickets. Alternatively, maybe the rule requires exactly two blickets. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's state changes when you add or remove objects. So when I take object 1 off, maybe the machine could turn on or off. Let me try that first.\n\nCommand: take 1 off machine. Then look to see if the machine is on. If after removing 1, the machine is still off, that tells me that 1 wasn't contributing. Then, maybe try adding another object, say 0, and see if the machine turns on. If it does, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 0 isn't. Then repeat with other objects.\n\nWait, but each step is limited. Let's proceed step by step. First, take object 1 off the machine. Then check the state. Then maybe try adding another object and see.\n\nSo first action: take 1 off the machine. Then look. Let's do that.\n\nBut the initial state has object 1 on the machine. Let's take it off. Then, the machine is empty. If the machine is still off, that doesn't help much. Then, add object 0. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine only turns on when certain combinations are present. So maybe the number of blickets on it needs to be even, or odd, or a specific number. Or perhaps a certain pair. But since we don't know, it's better to test individual objects first.\n\nSo the plan: remove object 1 (since it's currently on the machine and the machine is off). Then test each object one by one by placing them on the machine and checking if the light turns on. If placing an object alone on the machine turns it on, that object is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or the rule requires more than one.\n\nSo first step: take 1 off machine. Then look.\n\nAfter that, check the machine's state. If it's still off, then proceed to place object 0 on the machine. Then look. If the machine is on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, take it off and try the next object. Repeat this for all objects. But since each step is a command, this could take a lot of steps. But we have 32 steps, so maybe possible.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see. Since we can only do one command per step, each put and take is a step, and each look is another step. So for each object, to test it alone on the machine, we need: take everything off, put the object on, look. Then take it off. That's 3 steps per object. For 8 objects, that's 24 steps. Plus the initial steps. But maybe some objects can be tested in combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. So testing pairs would be necessary. But that's more complex. Let's try individual testing first.\n\nSo starting with object 1 off. Now the machine is empty. Let's put object 0 on the machine. Then look. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, take it off and try the next. So step 1: take 1 off machine. Step 2: put 0 on machine. Step 3: look. Then step 4: take 0 off. Then put 2 on, look, etc.\n\nBut the initial steps would be:\n\n1. take 1 off machine\n2. look (to check if machine turns on when empty? Probably not, but maybe the rule is that the machine is on when there are no blickets? Unlikely, but possible. But initial state had 1 on and machine off. So removing 1 leaves machine empty. If the machine is still off, then the presence of a blicket is needed. So if after putting 0 on, machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then not.\n\nSo let's proceed with that.\n\nBut first, taking 1 off. So the first command would be 'take 1 off machine'.\n\nThen, the machine is empty. Then, I need to check the machine's state. So the next command is 'look'. Then the description would tell me if the machine is on or off. If it's still off, then proceed.\n\nThen, put 0 on the machine. Then 'look' again. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, take it off and try next.\n\nBut each 'look' is a step, so this could take time. Let's see.\n\nBut let's start.\n\nFirst command: take 1 off machine.\n\nAfter that, the objects on the machine are none. Then, the machine's state is off. So next step: put 0 on machine. Then look. If machine is on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, take 0 off, then try 2.\n\nBut let's simulate this.\n\nAfter taking 1 off, the machine is empty. Then, putting 0 on. Then look. If the machine is on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then 0 isn't. Then take 0 off, and put 2 on, look, etc.\n\nThis is a systematic approach. Since there's 8 objects, this might take some steps, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient way. For example, putting multiple objects on the machine and then using elimination. For instance, if putting objects 0 and 1 on the machine turns it on, then at least one of them is a blicket. Then, test each individually. But this is more efficient if the number of blickets is small.\n\nBut given that we don't know the rule, the safest approach is to test each object individually first.\n\nSo let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFirst command: take 1 off machine. Then, proceed to test each object.\n\nBut the first command is taking 1 off. Let's do that."}

The machine's light is off, and initially, object 1 was on the machine, but when I tried to take it off, it said \"1 is not a recognized object.\" Wait, maybe the problem is that the command syntax is different. Earlier, when I tried \"take 1 off machine\" it didn't recognize it, but when I used \"object 1\" in the command, it worked. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no. The first attempt was \"take 1 off machine\" and the response was \"1 is not a recognized object.\" Then when I tried \"put 0 on machine\" it also said 0 is not recognized, but when I used \"put object 0 on machine,\" it worked. So the correct syntax must include the word \"object\" before the number. So I need to use \"object X\" in the commands.\n\nSo initially, object 1 was on the machine. The light was off. Then after putting object 0 and 2 on the machine, the light remains off. So maybe those objects (0 and 2) aren't blickets, or the rule isn't simply having any blicket on the machine. Maybe the rule requires a specific combination, like a certain number or a particular set.\n\nWait, but maybe object 1 was already on the machine, and the machine was off. So when I took it off, but couldn't, then put other objects on, the machine stayed off. So perhaps object 1 is not a blicket, or the rule isn't activated by just one blicket. Maybe the rule requires more than one blicket on the machine to activate.\n\nBut first, let's check if object 1 is a blicket. Since it was on the machine initially and the light was off, maybe it's not a blicket. But perhaps the machine needs a certain configuration. Let's try removing object 1. Wait, the first command I did was \"take 1 off machine\" but it said 1 is not recognized. Oh, right, maybe the correct command is \"take object 1 off machine\". Let me try that next. Because maybe the initial attempt failed because of the command syntax.\n\nSo the current state: objects 0 and 2 are on the machine. The light is off. So perhaps they aren't blickets. Let's try adding another object. Maybe try putting object 3 on the machine. If the light turns on, then maybe three objects are needed, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on it. If 0 and 2 aren't, but adding another might trigger it. But maybe the initial setup had object 1 on the machine, which might be a blicket. But when I tried to take it off, the command failed. Wait, maybe object 1 isn't an actual object. Wait, the initial description says: object 1 is on top of the machine. So when I tried to take 1 off, it didn't recognize it. But when I used the correct syntax, like \"take object 1 off machine\", maybe that would work. Let's check that next.\n\nSo the next step is to try removing object 1. Let's do that. Then, maybe try putting other objects on the machine. Alternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the sum of the blicktness is a certain value. For example, maybe each blicket has a value, and the machine turns on when the total is above a threshold. But without knowing, we need to test combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the number of blickets on the machine. For instance, the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. But since object 1 was on the machine initially and the light was off, that would mean object 1 isn't a blicket. Then adding 0 and 2 didn't help. So perhaps none of those are blickets. So maybe the blickets are among 3-7. Let's try putting object 3 on the machine next. If the light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, perhaps we need more.\n\nSo the next command should be \"put object 3 on machine\". Let's see what happens. If the light remains off, then 3 isn't a blicket. Then maybe try adding 4, etc. But this could take a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present, or something like that. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires all blickets to be on it. So if there are, say, two blickets, both need to be on. But how to find out.\n\nAnother approach: remove all objects from the machine and test each one individually. But since initially object 1 was on the machine, but the light was off, perhaps object 1 isn't a blicket. So to remove it, need the correct command. Let's try \"take object 1 off machine\". If that works, then we can clear the machine and start adding objects one by one.\n\nSo let's try that first. The next command: take object 1 off machine. Then the machine would have objects 0, 2, and whatever else. Wait, no, currently, after previous steps, objects 0 and 2 are on the machine, and object 1 was originally on it but perhaps couldn't be removed. Wait, the initial state was object 1 on the machine. Then the user tried to take 1 off, but the command was wrong. Then they put 0 and 2 on. So now the machine has object 1, 0, and 2? Wait, no. Wait, when you put an object on the machine, does it add to the existing ones? Or does each put command replace? The description says \"All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\" So each object is either on the machine or the floor. So putting an object on the machine moves it from the floor to the machine, and taking it off moves it back.\n\nSo initially, object 1 was on the machine. Then the user put 0 and 2 on the machine. So now objects 0,1,2 are on the machine. Wait, no. Because when you put object 0 on the machine, it moves from the floor to the machine. Similarly for 2. So the machine now has objects 1, 0, and 2. But the light is off. So with three objects on the machine, the light is off. So maybe none of these are blickets. Or the rule requires a specific combination.\n\nBut perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly two blickets are present. If objects 0 and 1 are not blickets, but 2 is, but with 1,0,2 on the machine, but maybe only 2 is a blicket, but that's not enough. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but if the initial object 1 is not a blicket, then adding 0 and 2 (also not blickets) would not help. So perhaps we need to test other objects.\n\nSo the next step could be to take object 1 off the machine to see if that's possible. Let's try that. If we can remove object 1, then we can test other combinations. So the command would be \"take object 1 off machine\". If successful, then the machine would have objects 0 and 2. Then maybe add another object. If the light remains off, then maybe those three (0,2, and the new one) aren't blickets.\n\nBut first, let's try removing object 1. So:\n\n> take object 1 off machine\n\nIf that works, then the machine now has 0 and 2. Then maybe test if the light is still off. If yes, then perhaps those two aren't blickets. Then try adding another object, say 3. If the light turns on, then 3 might be a blicket, or maybe the combination of 0,2,3. But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it requires all blickets to be on it. If there are multiple blickets, they all need to be present. So perhaps we need to find all blickets and place them all on the machine.\n\nBut how to determine which ones. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nAssuming that after taking object 1 off the machine, the machine has 0 and 2. Then, if we add 3 and the light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, perhaps add 4, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is based on parity. For example, even number of blickets. Or maybe the sum of their indices, but that's more complex.\n\nAnother angle: when the user put object 0 and 2 on the machine, the light stayed off. If those aren't blickets, then perhaps trying to add others. Let's proceed to the next step."}

The initial state was that object 1 was on the machine, and others were on the floor. The machine's light was off. Then, when the user tried to take 1 off, it said \"1 is not a recognized object.\" Wait, maybe that was a typo? Because later, when they took object 1 off, it worked. So maybe the initial command was missing the word \"object\". \n\nSo, the initial setup had object 1 on the machine, but the machine's light was off. Then, after putting objects 0 and 2 on the machine, the light remained off. Then taking object 1 off didn't change anything. Hmm.\n\nBut the goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule makes the machine turn on. Blicketness causes the machine to activate, but the rule isn't obvious. Maybe the machine requires a specific combination of objects. Let's think about possible rules:\n\n1. Only certain individual objects are blickets, and having at least one on the machine turns it on. But in the initial state, object 1 was on, but the light was off. So maybe object 1 is not a blicket. But that's not enough info yet.\n\n2. The rule could require a certain number of blickets. For example, two or more blickets on the machine. When they added 0 and 2, but the light stayed off. So maybe neither 0 nor 2 are blickets. Or maybe the rule is different.\n\n3. Maybe the machine requires a specific combination, like two specific objects together. Or perhaps a particular weight or arrangement. But the user can only add or remove objects, so it's likely a logical rule based on presence/absence.\n\nWait, after putting 0 and 2 on, the machine is still off. Then, taking 1 off (which was already off, but maybe that was a mistake). Wait, initially, object 1 was on the machine. Then the user tried to take 1 off but got an error (maybe because of incorrect syntax), then after putting 0 and 2 on, they took object 1 off, but since object 1 was already on the machine initially, maybe the user was removing it. But in any case, the machine is still off.\n\nSo, the initial state had object 1 on the machine, but the machine was off. So object 1 alone isn't a blicket. Then adding 0 and 2 didn't help. So maybe 0 and 2 aren't blickets either.\n\nPossible next steps: Try other objects. Let's see, which objects are currently on the machine now? After the user's commands, object 0 and 2 are on the machine. Then object 1 was taken off. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state was object 1 on the machine. Then the user put object 0 and 2 on, so now the machine has 1, 0, 2? Wait no, no\u2014the commands were:\n\n1. take 1 off machine (failed because syntax was wrong)\n2. put 0 on machine (failed)\n3. put object 0 on machine (success, machine now has object 0 and 1?)\nWait, no. Wait, the initial state was object 1 on the machine. Then the user put object 0 on the machine. So the machine now has 1 and 0. Then put object 2 on the machine, so machine has 1,0,2. Then took object 1 off, so machine has 0 and 2. Light remains off.\n\nSo with 0 and 2 on the machine, light is off. So those two together don't trigger it. So maybe neither is a blicket. Or the rule requires more. Let's see. The user has to test other combinations.\n\nPossible next steps: Try putting another object on the machine. Let's try object 3. If adding 3 to 0 and 2 (assuming they are on the machine now) makes the light turn on, maybe the rule is that three or more blickets are needed. But we don't know which are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine only turns on when exactly one blicket is present. But initial state had 1 on and it was off. So maybe 1 is not a blicket, but another object is. Let's test individual objects.\n\nSo, first, clear the machine. Take all objects off. Then put one at a time and see.\n\nBut the user has limited steps. Let's think efficiently.\n\nCurrent state after the previous commands: Objects 0 and 2 are on the machine. The light is off. So perhaps 0 and 2 are not blickets.\n\nNext, maybe try removing them and testing others.\n\nBut the user can only take off objects from the machine. So first, take off 0 and 2. Then try adding others one by one.\n\nSo possible commands:\n\ntake object 0 off machine\n\ntake object 2 off machine\n\nThen, put object 3 on machine, check light. If light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine requires an odd number of blickets, or specific combinations.\n\nBut given the initial attempt with 1 (which didn't work), and 0 and 2 (which didn't work), maybe the blickets are among other numbers.\n\nSo the next step would be to clear the machine (take off 0 and 2), then try adding another object, say 3.\n\nBut the user has to do this step by step.\n\nSo current machine has objects 0 and 2. Let's take them off.\n\nCommand would be: take object 0 off machine.\n\nBut each command is one step. So first, take object 0 off. Then take object 2 off. Then put object 3 on. Then check light.\n\nBut each of these is a separate step. Let's see, in the previous commands, the user has used 5 steps (including the initial two failed ones). But the step count here is up to 32, so plenty left.\n\nBut the user needs to think of efficient steps. Let's see.\n\nCurrent state: objects on machine are 0, 2. Light is off.\n\nSo taking them off. Then testing individual objects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule. For example, the machine only turns on when a single specific object is on it. Let's try each object one by one.\n\nBut first, clear the machine.\n\nSo next steps:\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n\n> take object 2 off machine\n\nThen put object 1 on machine (since initially it was on, but maybe the user wants to retest). But when object 1 was on, the machine was off. So maybe 1 isn't a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, try object 3.\n\nSo after clearing, put 3 on machine. If light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present, but only certain ones.\n\nBut given that the user tried 0 and 2, which didn't work, perhaps those are not blickets. So let's try other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of some property (like weight) is needed, but since the user can't observe that, it's more likely a logical rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires that all objects on it are blickets. So if any non-blicket is on, it doesn't activate. So if the user puts multiple blickets on, but no non-blickets, then it turns on. For example, in the initial state, object 1 was on the machine alone, but maybe it's not a blicket, so the machine stays off. Then, when 0 and 2 (non-blickets) were added, the machine remains off. Then when 1 was removed, leaving 0 and 2 (non-blickets), still off. So the rule might be that all objects on the machine must be blickets. So if you have at least one blicket and no non-blickets, the machine turns on.\n\nBut how to test that.\n\nSo, for example, if the user puts a single blicket on the machine, then the light would turn on. If a non-blicket is added, it turns off. So maybe that's the rule.\n\nBut to test this, the user needs to find at least one blicket. So let's try putting individual objects and see.\n\nSo, after clearing the machine, start with object 3. Put it on. If light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, try 4, etc.\n\nBut the user may need to do this for each object. But with 8 objects, that's 8 steps, which is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. So testing pairs.\n\nBut with 8 objects, that's 28 pairs, which is too many steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket, but the initial object (1) is not a blicket. So when the user put 0 and 2, which are not blickets, light remains off. So the next step is to try another object.\n\nBut how to proceed.\n\nSo, current machine has 0 and 2. Light is off. Let's remove them.\n\nFirst, take object 0 off. Then take object 2 off.\n\nThen, try putting object 3 on. If light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. Else, try 4, etc.\n\nBut the user needs to proceed step by step.\n\nSo the next command would be to take object 0 off the machine.\n\nBut wait, the previous commands were:\n\n1. take 1 off machine (failed)\n2. put 0 on machine (failed)\n3. put object 0 on machine (success)\n4. put object 2 on machine (success)\n5. take object 1 off machine (success, but object 1 was on the machine initially, so now machine has 0 and 2)\n\nSo current machine has objects 0 and 2. So the next step is to take them off.\n\nSo first command: take object 0 off machine.\n\nThen take object 2 off.\n\nThen try putting another object.\n\nSo the first command here would be to take object 0 off. Let's see what the assistant would do."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets have some \"blicktness\" that affects the machine.\n\nFirst, let's recap the initial state. The machine starts with object 1 on it, and the light is off. The other objects (0, 2-7) are on the floor. The user tried taking object 1 off, then putting 0 and 2 on, but the light stayed off. Then they removed 0 and 1. Now, object 2 is still on the machine, right? Wait, no. Wait, the user's steps were:\n\n1. Took object 1 off (but initially, object 1 was on the machine). Then put 0 and 2 on. Then took 1 off again (but maybe that was a mistake?), then took 0 off. So currently, after those commands, the machine has object 2 on it. Because the last step was taking object 0 off. So the machine now has object 2 on it, but the light is still off.\n\nWait, let me check the commands again:\n\n- The initial state: objects on machine is 1. Others on floor.\n\nFirst command: take 1 off machine. Response was \"1 is not a recognized object.\" Wait, maybe the user tried to type \"take object 1 off machine\" but mistyped. Then the user tried to put 0 on, but again mistyped. Then they corrected to \"put object 0 on machine\" which worked, then put object 2 on machine. Then took object 1 off (which was already off?), then took object 0 off. So now, after these steps, the machine has object 2 on it. But the light is still off.\n\nSo putting objects 0 and 2 on the machine didn't activate it. Then when they took 1 off, which was already off, but maybe that's irrelevant. Now, the machine has object 2 on it. But the light is off. So maybe object 2 alone isn't a blicket. Or maybe the rule requires more than one blicket? Or perhaps the presence of object 1 was involved. Wait, initially, object 1 was on the machine, but the light was off. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. Then when they put 0 and 2 on, still no light. Then removing 0 and 1 (which was already off) didn't change anything. So maybe neither 0, 1, nor 2 are blickets.\n\nBut how to proceed? The user needs to test other objects. Maybe try putting multiple objects on the machine to see if any combination triggers the light. For example, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. So if we can find which combination of objects causes the light to turn on, then those would be the blickets.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be something like an OR (any single blicket), but in that case, perhaps object 1 was a blicket but the initial state had it on the machine and the light was off. That would contradict that. Wait, but initially, the light was off when object 1 was on the machine. So maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. So the initial state had object 1 on the machine, but the light was off. So object 1 is not a blicket. Then when the user put 0 and 2 on, still nothing. So perhaps those aren't blickets either.\n\nSo maybe the blickets are among objects 3-7. Let's test those. The next step should be to try putting one of them on the machine. For example, let's try object 3. If putting it alone doesn't work, maybe combine with others. But since steps are limited, need to be efficient.\n\nSo, next command could be \"put object 3 on machine\". Let's see if that turns the light on. If yes, then 3 is a blicket. If not, maybe try adding another. But need to track which combinations activate the machine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of blickets must be odd, or some other condition. But without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But with 8 objects, that's unlikely. So perhaps the rule is that exactly two blickets must be on the machine. Let's test that.\n\nBut given that the user has already tried 0 and 2, which didn't work, maybe those aren't blickets. Let's try putting 3 and 4 on. But step count is limited, so need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, start by putting one object at a time. Let's try object 3. If that alone doesn't work, then maybe 3 isn't a blicket. Then try 4, and so on.\n\nBut let's check current state. The machine currently has object 2 on it (from previous steps). Wait, after the last command, \"take object 0 off machine\", so the machine has object 2 on it. So the current state is: object 2 is on the machine, objects 0,1,3-7 on floor. The light is off.\n\nSo, to test if object 2 is a blicket, we can see if adding another object activates the machine. Or maybe remove object 2 and try another.\n\nBut perhaps first, check if object 2 is a blicket. If the machine is off when only 2 is on, then 2 is not a blicket. So maybe try removing 2 and putting another object. For example, remove 2 and put 3.\n\nWait, current machine has 2. So to test 3, take 2 off first.\n\nSo next command could be \"take object 2 off machine\" to clear the machine, then put object 3 on. Let's see.\n\nBut since the user is limited in steps, maybe it's better to take off 2 and put 3 on. So:\n\nTake object 2 off machine. Then put object 3 on machine. If the light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, maybe try adding another.\n\nBut each step is a command. So each action (take or put) is a separate step.\n\nSo, first, take object 2 off. Then put 3 on. Then check the light.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state updates after each command. So, if the machine has 2 on it, and I take it off, then put 3 on, that's two steps. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the user should first remove object 2 from the machine to have a clean slate, then start testing other objects.\n\nSo next step: take object 2 off machine.\n\nAfter that, the machine is empty. Then put object 3 on machine. If light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, try adding another object.\n\nBut given the initial attempts, maybe the blickets are among higher-numbered objects. Let's try that."}
