Since I can't tell by looking, I need to experiment by placing objects on the machine and observing if the light turns on.\n\nFirst, maybe try putting one object on the machine and see what happens. Let's pick object 0. If the machine turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe the rule requires more than one. Let's check.\n\nSo, command: put object 0 on machine."}
