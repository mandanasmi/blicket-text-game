Let me start by understanding the current state. The machine has object 4 on it, and the light is off. All other objects are on the floor.\n\nFirst, maybe I should check what happens when I remove object 4. If taking it off makes the machine stay off, maybe it's not a blicket. But wait, the machine is already off. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires a certain combination. Since object 4 is already on, and the machine is off, maybe object 4 alone isn't enough. Maybe there's a different rule, like needing a specific number or specific objects.\n\nWait, but the initial setup might not have any blickets. Let me try adding another object. Let me try putting object 0 on the machine. If that turns the machine on, then either 0 or 4 could be a blicket, or maybe both. But since the machine is off with 4 alone, adding 0 might change things. Let me do that.\n\nSo, command: put 0 on machine. Then check if the light turns on. If it does, maybe one of them is a blicket. If not, maybe neither or a different combination."}
