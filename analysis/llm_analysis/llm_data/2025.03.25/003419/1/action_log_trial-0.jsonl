I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine is currently off, and object 1 is already on it. So maybe the machine isn't activating because object 1 alone isn't enough. Maybe it needs more than one blicket, or maybe object 1 isn't a blicket at all.\n\nFirst, I should check if putting another object on the machine along with object 1 will turn it on. Let me try adding object 0. If the machine lights up, then either object 0 or 1 (or both) might be blickets. Wait, but if adding 0 makes it work, maybe the combination of 1 and 0 is needed. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. Since there are 8 objects, maybe only certain ones are blickets. Let's start by testing object 1. Since it's already on the machine, perhaps removing it to see if the machine stays off. Wait, but if I take it off, the machine would have no objects. Maybe that's not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is off because the current configuration (object 1 alone) doesn't meet the rule. Let me try adding object 0. So I'll do 'put 0 on machine'. Then check the machine's status. If it turns on, then either 0 or 1 or both are blickets. If not, maybe they aren't. But then I can test other combinations.\n\nWait, but maybe the rule is something else, like needing at least two blickets. So if object 1 is a blicket, but alone it's not enough. Let's see. Let me try adding object 0. If the machine turns on, then maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets, and the rule is that at least two are needed. If it doesn't, then maybe 1 isn't a blicket. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the total number of blickets on the machine is even, or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps object 1 isn't a blicket. Maybe the initial setup has a non-blicket on the machine, which is why it's off. So first, take object 1 off the machine. Then put another object on and see. But since the initial state has object 1 on the machine and the light is off, maybe object 1 isn't a blicket. So maybe removing it and trying other objects would help.\n\nHmm. Let's try taking object 1 off first. So command 'take 1 off machine'. Then, put object 0 on the machine. If the machine lights up, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then 0 isn't. Then proceed accordingly. But that's using two steps. Alternatively, maybe I can test combinations more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of blicket numbers must be a certain value. But that's more complicated. Let's start with simpler tests.\n\nFirst, take object 1 off the machine. Then, see if putting a single object on the machine activates it. If so, then that object is a blicket. If not, maybe the rule requires multiple blickets. But since the initial state had one object (1) on the machine and it's off, maybe 1 is not a blicket. Let's try removing 1 and testing individual objects.\n\nSo step 1: take 1 off machine. Now machine is empty. Then put object 0 on machine. Check if light turns on. If yes, 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe not. Then take 0 off, put 2 on, etc. But that's time-consuming. But since we have 32 steps, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that at least two blickets are needed. So let's try putting two objects on the machine. For example, put 0 and 1 on. But first, 1 is already on. Wait, no, after taking 1 off, then put 0 and 1 on. Wait, no, maybe the machine's state only updates when you do a command. So let's proceed.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. Let me start by taking object 1 off. That way, the machine is empty. Then, if I put a single object on, like 0, and the machine lights up, that would indicate that object is a blicket. If not, try another. But this might take too many steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial setup (object 1 on machine) is part of the clue. Since the machine is off, perhaps object 1 isn't a blicket. So removing it and putting other objects on. Let's start with that.\n\nSo first command: take 1 off machine. Then, look to see the state. Then put 0 on machine. Then look again. If machine is on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then not. Then take 0 off, put 1 on again, check if it's on. Wait, but maybe the machine's activation depends on the combination. Let's try.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the number of blickets on the machine must be odd. So if I have one blicket, it's on. If two, off. But I don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates if exactly two blickets are on it. So need to find two that, when placed together, activate.\n\nBut this is all speculative. Need to start experimenting.\n\nSo first, take 1 off the machine. Then check the state. Then put 0 on. Then look. Let's proceed with that."}
