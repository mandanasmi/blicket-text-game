So, there are four objects: 0, 1, 2, and 3. They start off all on the floor. The machine's light is off. The goal is to determine which ones are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nSo far, I put objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine one by one. After each addition, the machine's light stayed off. Hmm. So putting them individually didn't activate it. Maybe the rule requires a combination of objects? Like needing at least two blickets on the machine? Or maybe it's about the number of blickets, not the total objects. Let's see. If I put object 3 on the machine now, making all four objects on it, maybe the light will turn on. But maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly three blickets, and I haven't added the third one yet. Wait, I added three objects so far (0,1,2) and the light is still off. If all three were blickets, but the rule is that the machine needs all blickets to be on, but maybe there's a fourth blicket (object 3) that's required. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present, or something like that. Or maybe it's a specific combination. Let's test adding object 3. If the light turns on when I add it, that might suggest that all four are needed. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe none of the first three are blickets, and object 3 is the only one. Let's try adding object 3 next. If the light turns on, then maybe object 3 is a blicket. But wait, if I add object 3 now, the machine has all four objects. If the light turns on, then maybe the rule is that all four must be on. But the user mentioned that blickets are objects whose presence affects the machine's state. So, if all four are required, then each is a blicket. But maybe the rule is different. Alternatively, perhaps the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on. But since adding 0,1,2 didn't do anything, maybe none of them are blickets. Let's test adding 3. If I add object 3 and the light turns on, then object 3 is a blicket, but then the rule might be that the presence of at least one blicket turns it on. Wait, but when I added 0,1,2, which might not be blickets, the light stayed off. So if adding 3 makes it turn on, then 3 is a blicket. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. So in that case, if I add 3 and the light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. Then I can conclude that. But I need to test more combinations. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are present. So, if I have two blickets on the machine, it turns on. But since adding three didn't do anything, maybe none of those three are blickets. Let's try adding object 3 now. If the light turns on, that suggests that adding 3 is a blicket. But wait, if the machine requires exactly one blicket, then adding 3 would activate it. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on. So if there are multiple blickets, say 3 and 1, but I have to put all of them on. Let's see. So far, after adding 0,1,2, the light is off. If I add 3 and it turns on, then maybe 3 is the only blicket. But that would mean the rule is that having at least one blicket on turns it on, which contradicts the initial steps where adding 0,1,2 didn't activate it. So maybe the rule is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires that the number of blickets on it is odd. If I add three non-blickets and one blicket, the total blickets would be one (odd), so the light turns on. But I need to test. So let's proceed by adding object 3 next."}
