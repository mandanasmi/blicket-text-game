So there's a machine and four objects, numbered 0 to 3. My goal is to figure out which ones are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The blickets are the ones whose presence on the machine affects the machine's state. So, mutual information between the object being on the machine and the machine's state is non-zero. That means, if the machine's state (on/off) changes when I add or remove the object, then it's a blicket.\n\nFirst, I need to test each object individually to see if placing them alone on the machine turns it on. That way, I can determine if any single object is a blicket. Let's start with object 0. I'll put object 0 on the machine and check the machine's light. If it turns on, then object 0 might be a blicket. Then, I can take it off and see if the light turns off again. If both steps work, that's a good sign. But I also need to consider if the rule is more complex, like requiring multiple blickets to be present. Maybe the machine only turns on when a certain number of blickets are on it, or a specific combination.\n\nWait, the tips mention that the state of the machine is dependent on the blickets. So the mutual information implies that the presence of the blicket is informative about the machine's state. So maybe if I put a blicket on the machine, the probability of the machine being on increases, but perhaps other factors are involved. For example, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be on, or all blickets must be on, or an even number, etc.\n\nBut let's start simple. Let me test each object one by one. So first, put object 0 on the machine. Then check the light. If the light turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. Then take it off, and if the light turns off, that confirms it. Then repeat for objects 1, 2, and 3. But maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on only when multiple blickets are present. So even if a single blicket is on, it doesn't turn on. So testing each individually might not be enough. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it. In that case, testing each one alone would work. But if the rule is more like \"exactly two blickets must be on,\" then individual tests wouldn't show anything. So maybe I need to try combinations as well.\n\nBut since I have limited steps (32), I need to be efficient. Let's start with testing each object alone. Then, if none of them activate the machine alone, try combinations. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll put object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens."}

Or maybe it's a logical OR, where any blicket being present activates it. But since putting object 0 didn't activate it, maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Let me test object 1 next. So, the next command would be 'put object 1 on the machine'. Let's see what happens."}
