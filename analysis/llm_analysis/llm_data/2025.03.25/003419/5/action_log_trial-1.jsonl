Let's start by understanding the setup. The machine is off right now. Objects can be on the machine or the floor. Blickets are objects that affect the machine's state, meaning their presence on the machine is somehow related to the machine turning on.\n\nFirst, let me check the current state. Objects 0, 1, and 3 are on the floor. Object 2 is on the machine. The machine is off. Hmm, so maybe object 2 isn't a blicket, or perhaps the rule requires more than one blicket. But maybe the rule is different. Let me test this.\n\nI should start by taking object 2 off the machine to see if the machine stays off. If I remove it and the machine remains off, that doesn't tell me much. Wait, right now, with object 2 on the machine, the machine is off. So object 2 alone doesn't activate it. Maybe it's not a blicket, or maybe the rule is that the machine activates only when all blickets are on, but there's more than one. Alternatively, maybe it's a different combination.\n\nLet me try removing object 2 from the machine. If the machine is off, then maybe having it on didn't do anything. Wait, but if the machine was on when it was there, but it's off now. But the initial state is that the machine is off with object 2 on it. So that suggests that object 2 alone isn't enough. So maybe object 2 isn't a blicket. Or maybe the rule requires a certain number of blickets to be on.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. But since object 2 is on the machine and it's off, that would mean object 2 isn't a blicket. So possible. Let's test that.\n\nSo first, take object 2 off the machine. Then the machine is empty. Then, maybe try putting other objects on one by one to see if any single one turns it on. For example, put object 0 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe not. Then do the same for 1 and 3. But maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on, or some combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on only when exactly two blickets are on. Or maybe the presence of a blicket in combination with others. But since I don't know, I need to test different combinations.\n\nBut let's start with the initial state. Since object 2 is on the machine and the machine is off, that's a data point. So first, remove object 2. Then check the machine's state. Wait, but the machine is already off. So taking it off might not change anything. Let's see.\n\nAfter taking object 2 off, the machine has no objects. Then, maybe try putting another object on. Let's pick object 0 first. So put object 0 on the machine. Then check if the machine turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe 0 isn't. Then proceed with others.\n\nSo, first step: take object 2 off the machine. Then put object 0 on. Let's see."}
