I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine's light turned on when I placed object 2 on it, but before that, putting objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine didn't activate it. Wait, no, the previous steps were putting 0, then 1, then 2. After putting 2, the light came on. So maybe the rule is that having object 2 on the machine is necessary. But I need to check if other combinations might also trigger it.\n\nWait, let's recap. Initially, all objects were on the floor. The first command was putting object 0 on the machine. The light stayed off. Then object 1 was added, light still off. Then adding object 2 made the light turn on. So maybe the machine requires at least two objects, but only when one of them is 2? Or maybe the rule is that the sum of certain properties reaches a threshold. Alternatively, maybe the presence of object 2 is necessary and sufficient. But when only object 2 was on the machine, did the light turn on? Wait, no. The third command was putting object 2 on the machine when objects 0 and 1 were already there. So when object 2 was added, the total became three objects. But the light turned on then. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when three or more objects are placed on it. But that might not be the case. Or maybe it's the presence of a specific combination, like objects 1 and 2 together, or 0,1,2 together. Or perhaps object 2 is a blicket and the others are not, but the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. Wait, but when I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light didn't turn on, but adding 2 made it work. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. But then why didn't putting 2 alone trigger it? Wait, maybe when I added 2, the machine had objects 0,1,2. So if the rule is that the machine activates when exactly three objects are on it, but that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when all blickets are on it. Suppose there are two blickets, say 2 and another. But I need to test more scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the number of blickets on it is odd. But with the current information, it's hard to tell. Let me think of possible next steps. Maybe I should remove some objects and test again. For example, take object 0 and 1 off, leaving only 2 on the machine. If the light stays on, then 2 is sufficient. If it turns off, then maybe the combination of 2 with others is needed. Alternatively, if taking 0 and 1 off makes the light turn off, that would suggest that having 2 alone isn't enough, but when combined with others, it works. But that seems a bit odd. Let's try that. So next step: take off objects 0 and 1, leaving 2 on the machine. Then check the light. If it's still on, then 2 is a blicket and sufficient. If not, then maybe the rule requires multiple blickets. But how?\n\nWait, in the current state, the machine has 0,1,2 on it, and the light is on. Let's remove 0 and 1. So after taking them off, only 2 remains. If the light stays on, that suggests that 2 alone is sufficient, so 2 is a blicket. If the light turns off, then the presence of 0 and 1 might be necessary in combination with 2. But that's possible. Let's do that. First, take object 0 off the machine. Then take object 1 off. Then check the status.\n\nBut in the previous steps, after putting 0, 1, and 2, the light turned on. So maybe the presence of 2 is the key. Let's test if 2 alone can activate it. So take 0 and 1 off. If the light remains on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the rule is that when 2 is present along with others. Alternatively, perhaps the machine requires exactly three objects, but that's not very likely. Let's proceed with taking 0 and 1 off. \n\nAnother approach: test each object individually. Put each one on the machine alone and see if the light turns on. So far, when 0 was put alone, light stayed off. Then 1 was added, still off. Then 2 was added, light on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and when it's added, the machine turns on. But let's test 2 alone. If I take off 0 and 1, leaving 2, and the light stays on, then 2 is sufficient. Otherwise, maybe the presence of 2 with others is needed. Let's try that. \n\nAnother angle: the machine might require a certain combination. For example, the sum of some property. But given that after adding 2, the light turned on, maybe 2 is the only blicket, and the machine requires at least one blicket. But when 2 was added, the machine had three objects. So maybe the rule is that the presence of a blicket (object 2) and at least two other objects. That would be a more complex rule, but possible. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present, but I need more data.\n\nLet me outline possible next steps:\n\n1. Remove objects 0 and 1, leaving only 2 on the machine. Check if the light stays on. If yes, then 2 is a blicket. If no, then maybe the rule requires multiple blickets or specific combinations.\n\n2. Test object 3. Put object 3 on the machine alone. If the light doesn't turn on, then 3 is not a blicket. If it does, then 3 is a blicket. But since the light turned on when 2 was added, perhaps 2 is a blicket, and 3 might or might not be.\n\n3. After testing 2 alone, test combinations with 3. For example, put 2 and 3 on the machine. If the light is on, maybe 2 and 3 are blickets. If not, maybe only 2 is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present. So if 2 is a blicket, then putting 2 on the machine should activate it, regardless of other objects. But when I put 0,1,2 on the machine, the light came on. If I then remove 0 and 1, leaving 2 alone, does the light stay on? If yes, then 2 is a blicket. If the light turns off, then maybe the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be on it. But if 2 is the only blicket, then the rule would be that the machine is on when 2 is present, regardless of others. So the key test is whether 2 alone activates the machine.\n\nSo first, I need to take objects 0 and 1 off the machine to see if 2 alone keeps the light on.\n\nSo the next command would be to take object 0 off the machine. Then take object 1 off. Then check the status. But the user can only input one command at a time, so I need to do step by step.\n\nBut in the current state, after putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light is on. Let's take off 0 and 1.\n\nFirst command: take object 0 off machine. Then check if the light is still on. If yes, then 1 and 2 are still on. Then take 1 off. If after that, the light remains on, then 2 is the key. But let's proceed step by step.\n\nWait, the user can only input one command per step. So the next step is to decide which command to input now. The last action was putting object 2 on the machine, which caused the light to turn on. Now, the available commands are to take objects off or put others on.\n\nTo test whether 2 alone is sufficient, I should remove 0 and 1. So first, take object 0 off. Then take object 1 off. Then see if the light stays on.\n\nSo the next command would be 'take object 0 off machine'. Let's see what happens. After that, the machine would have objects 1 and 2 on it. If the light is still on, then maybe 2 is a blicket, but maybe the rule requires 1 and 2 together. Then, taking off 1 would leave 2 alone, and if the light stays on, 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then 1 and 2 together are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly three objects. But when I added the third object (2), the light turned on. But then again, that's when 0,1,2 were on. So if removing 0, leaving 1 and 2, the light may stay on. Then removing 1 would leave 2, and if the light goes off, that would suggest that the machine needs at least three objects. But that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of the object numbers equals a certain value. For example, 0+1+2=3, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when any blicket is present. So if 2 is a blicket, putting it on the machine should turn the light on, even alone. But in the current state, the machine has 0,1,2 on it and the light is on. If removing 0 and 1, and the light stays on with just 2, then 2 is a blicket. Otherwise, if the light goes off, then perhaps the presence of 2 with others is needed, which complicates the rule.\n\nSo the next step is to take object 0 off the machine. Let's try that."}
