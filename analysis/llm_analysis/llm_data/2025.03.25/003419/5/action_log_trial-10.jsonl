If object 0 was the only one on the machine and the light turned on, but removing it didn't turn it off, maybe the machine stays on once activated, regardless of the objects? Or perhaps there's a delay. Wait, no, the description says the machine's state is dependent on the objects. So maybe the rule isn't as simple as the presence of a single blicket. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the machine stays on once activated until some condition changes. But according to the problem, the machine's state should depend on the current configuration of objects. So perhaps when I took object 0 off, another object was on the machine? But according to the previous state, after putting 0 on, the other objects were on the floor. Then after taking 0 off, all objects are on the floor. So the machine's light is on even with no objects on it. That contradicts the initial assumption. So maybe the rule is more complex. Perhaps the machine requires a certain combination or sequence. Alternatively, maybe the machine's state is determined by the number of blickets, or their positions over time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state is updated only when you perform actions. Let's try putting 0 back on the machine again to see if the light stays on or turns off. Wait, but the light is already on. Let's try putting another object on the machine. Maybe object 1.
