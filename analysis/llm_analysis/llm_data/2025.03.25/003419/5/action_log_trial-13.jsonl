Or maybe the rule is more complex, like needing exactly two blickets, or all blickets must be on the machine.\n\nHmm, let's try removing object 1 first. If I take it off, then the machine would have no objects. If the machine's state changes when I remove it, that could indicate something. Wait, but right now the machine is off.
