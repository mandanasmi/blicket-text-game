So mutual information is key. So even if a single blicket doesn't turn it on alone, maybe in combination with others. Hmm, but how to approach this efficiently with limited steps.\n\nMaybe start by testing each object one by one. Let's try object 0 first. So the command would be 'put 0 on machine'. Then check the status with 'look'. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or the rule is more complex. But since I can only do one command at a time, I need to plan each step carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe putting all objects on the machine and then removing one at a time to see if the machine turns off.
