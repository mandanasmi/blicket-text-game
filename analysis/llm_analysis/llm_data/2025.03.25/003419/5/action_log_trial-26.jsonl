Let's start by recalling the information given. There are four objects, all on the floor initially. The machine is off. Blickets are objects that have a non-zero mutual information with the machine's state. That probably means that their presence or absence on the machine affects whether it turns on.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try putting one object on the machine at a time to see if any single object can activate the machine. If putting an object on the machine by itself turns it on, that object is likely a blicket. Let me try object 0 first. So I'll put object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens. If the light turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or maybe the rule requires more than one object. But since I don't know the rule yet, starting simple makes sense.\n\nAfter putting object 0 on the machine, if the machine doesn't turn on, I'll take it off and try the next object. This way, I can test each one individually. If none of them work alone, then maybe the rule requires a combination. For example, maybe two or more blickets need to be on the machine together. If that's the case, I'll have to test combinations. But since I have limited steps (32), I need to be efficient.\n\nAnother approach could be to put all objects on the machine at once. If the machine turns on, then at least one of them is a blicket, but then I'd have to narrow down which ones by removing them one by one. However, this might not work if the rule is something like \"exactly two blickets are needed,\" but I don't know yet. Maybe starting with individual tests is better.\n\nWait, but the problem says that blicketness is such that the object's state is not independent of the machine's state. So, if the machine's state (on/off) changes when you add or remove the object, that's a blicket. So, even if the rule requires multiple, each individual blicket would have some effect. But maybe the rule is additive. For example, the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Or maybe it's a specific number, like exactly two. Or maybe all blickets must be present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a logical rule like AND or OR. For example, the machine turns on if all blickets are on it (AND), or if any of the blickets are on it (OR). So testing individual objects would help determine if any of them are OR-type blickets. If none activate the machine alone, then it's likely an AND or a combination rule.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst command: put object 0 on the machine. Let's see if the machine turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. Then take it off and test others. If not, proceed to test object 1, etc.\n\nBut maybe after putting 0 on, the machine remains off. Then I take 0 off, put 1 on, check, etc. Once I check all four individually, if none activate, then try combinations of two. For example, put 0 and 1 on, see if it works. Then maybe 0 and 2, etc. But that could take many steps. Alternatively, if after testing individual objects, I can try putting all four on and see if it works. If it does, then remove them one by one to see which ones are necessary.\n\nHmm. Let's start with the first step. Let's put object 0 on the machine."}

So the goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the interactions so far, when I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then when I added object 2, the light turned on. That suggests that object 2 might be a blicket. But wait, maybe the rule isn't just having at least one blicket. Maybe it's a combination. Let's think: if the machine turns on when objects 0, 1, and 2 are all on it, but when only 0 and 1 were there, it didn't. So maybe the presence of 2 is necessary. But maybe there's another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are placed. But since putting 0 and 1 didn't work, but adding 2 made it work, perhaps objects 1 and 2 together activate it. Wait, but when I put 0, 1, then 2, the machine turned on after 2 was added. So maybe 2 alone is a blicket, and the machine requires at least one. But then why didn't the machine turn on when I added 0 and 1? Unless 0 and 1 are not blickets, and 2 is. Then adding 2 would make the machine turn on. But wait, the machine turned on when I added 2, which was the third object. Wait, but each time I added an object, the machine's state is checked after each addition. So when I added object 0, machine remains off. Then adding 1, still off. Then adding 2, now it's on. That suggests that the presence of object 2 is what caused it to turn on. So maybe object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But in that case, why didn't the machine turn on when I added 0 or 1? So perhaps 0 and 1 are not blickets, and 2 is. Then when I put 2 on, the machine turns on. But then why didn't it turn on when I put 0 and 1 first? Because they're not blickets, so adding them doesn't affect the machine. Then adding 2, which is a blicket, activates the machine. So that would make sense. But wait, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. Suppose there are multiple blickets. Wait, there are 4 objects. Maybe the rule is more complex, like an AND condition. For example, the machine turns on if both 2 and 3 are on. But we haven't tested 3 yet. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when any single blicket is present. So if 2 is the only blicket, then putting it on would activate the machine. But in this case, after putting 0 and 1, the machine was off. Then putting 2 made it on. So that fits. But then what about object 3? We haven't checked that yet. Maybe object 3 is also a blicket, or maybe not. So next steps could be to test other combinations. For example, take off 2 and see if the machine turns off. Then maybe add 3 to see if that activates it. Alternatively, try putting 3 alone. Let's see. Let me plan the next steps. Since the machine turned on when 2 was added, maybe the next step is to remove 2 and see if the machine turns off. Let's try that. So take object 2 off the machine. If the machine turns off, that confirms that object 2 is a blicket. Then, maybe test object 3 by putting it on the machine alone. If the machine turns on, then 3 is also a blicket. If not, then maybe only 2 is. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present, but that's getting complicated. Let's start with the simpler tests. So first, take object 2 off the machine. If the light goes off, then object 2 is a blicket. Then put object 3 on the machine to check if it's a blicket. Also, maybe check if putting 2 and 3 together does anything different. But since I have limited steps, need to be efficient. So first, take 2 off."}
