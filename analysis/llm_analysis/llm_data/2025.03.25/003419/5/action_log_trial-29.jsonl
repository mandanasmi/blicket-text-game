There are four objects (0, 1, 2, 3) all on the floor. The machine is off. My goal is to figure out which of these are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. \n\nFirst, I need to test individual objects. If I put one object on the machine and see if it activates, that can tell me if that object is a blicket. But I remember that sometimes the rule could be more complex, like needing a combination. But since I don't know the rule yet, starting simple makes sense.\n\nSo, maybe I should start by putting object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens. If the machine turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. But the rule could be something like \"at least one blicket\" or \"all blickets must be on the machine\". Hmm.\n\nWait, the tip says that a blicket's state is not independent of the machine's state. So mutual information exists. So, the presence of the blicket affects the machine's state. So, maybe if a blicket is on the machine, it contributes to turning it on. But how exactly?\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Let's start by testing each object one by one.\n\nCommand: put object 0 on the machine. Then check if the machine turns on. If yes, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe not. But perhaps the rule requires more than one. Let's try.\n\nWait, but the initial state is all objects on the floor. So the machine is off. If after putting object 0 on, the machine turns on, that's a clue. If not, maybe 0 isn't a blicket, or the rule needs multiple blickets.\n\nBut since I have limited steps (32), I need to be efficient. Maybe start with single objects, then combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is on it, or if all blickets are on it. Or maybe the number of blickets must be even, etc. But without info, I need to test.\n\nSo first step: put object 0 on the machine. Let's see the result."}
