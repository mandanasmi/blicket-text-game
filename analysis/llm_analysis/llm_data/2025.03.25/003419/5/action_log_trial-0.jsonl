Let's start by understanding the setup. There are four objects (0-3) all on the floor initially. The machine is off. The key is that blickets have some influence on the machine's state. The definition says a blicket's state isn't independent of the machine's state, so mutual information is non-zero. That probably means that the presence or absence of the blicket on the machine affects whether it turns on.\n\nFirst, I should probably test individual objects. Let's try putting one object on the machine and see if the light turns on. If it does, maybe that object is a blicket. If not, maybe not. But the rule could be more complex, like requiring a certain combination. But since I have limited steps (32), I should start simple.\n\nLet me start with object 0. I'll put object 0 on the machine. Then check the status. If the machine turns on, then 0 might be a blicket. If not, maybe not. Wait, but maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. Or maybe all blickets need to be on. So if I put a non-blicket on, nothing happens. But first, testing each object alone.\n\nSo first step: put 0 on machine. Then look to see if the light is on."}

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine's light is off initially. All objects are on the floor. The key is to experiment by placing objects on the machine and observing if the light turns on.\n\nFirst, I should check if placing a single object activates the machine. Let's try object 0. If I put it on the machine and the light turns on, maybe it's a blicket. If not, maybe not. But since the rule could be more complex, like needing multiple objects, I need to test combinations too.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that a blicket is an object whose state isn't independent of the machine. So mutual information implies that the presence or absence of the object affects the machine's state. So each blicket contributes in some way.\n\nPossible rules: machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it, or if all blickets are on it, or some other combination. To determine this, I need systematic testing.\n\nLet me start with individual objects. Let's try putting each one on the machine one by one and see the result. But since I have limited steps (32), maybe I can group some tests.\n\nFirst command: put object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens."}
