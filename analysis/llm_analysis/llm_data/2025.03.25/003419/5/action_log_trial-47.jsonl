Wait, the initial description says objects 0, 1, 2, 3 are on the floor. But when I tried 'put 0 on the machine', it said 0 is not recognized. That's confusing. Maybe the objects are named differently? Or perhaps there's a typo in the command.\n\nWait, the error message says \"0 is not a recognized object.\" So maybe the objects are not numbered 0-3 but have different labels? But the initial look command says objects 0,1,2,3 are on the floor. That seems contradictory. Maybe the user needs to refer to them as \"object 0\" instead of just 0? Let me check the command syntax again.\n\nThe valid commands are 'put <object> on [the] machine' or similar. Maybe the correct way is to use the full name, like 'put object 0 on the machine' instead of just 0. Let me try that. Because in the initial response, the user tried 'put 0 on the machine' and it didn't recognize 0 as an object. So perhaps the correct command is 'put object 0 on the machine'.\n\nSo the first step is to use the correct object names. Let me try that."}
