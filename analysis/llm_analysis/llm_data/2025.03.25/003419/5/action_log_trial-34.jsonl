There are four objects (0-3) all on the floor, and a machine that's off. My goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Since I can't tell by looking, I need to experiment by placing objects on the machine and observing the result.\n\nFirst, I should check if a single object can activate the machine. Let's try putting one object at a time. Maybe start with object 0. If the machine turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's part of a combination.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that blicketness is when the object's state and machine's state have mutual information. So, each blicket contributes somehow. The rule could be that at least one blicket is on the machine, or all blickets must be on, or maybe a certain number. But since I don't know the rule, I need to test different scenarios.\n\nLet me try putting object 0 on the machine. If the light turns on, that's a clue. If not, maybe 0 isn't a blicket, or the rule requires more than one. Then I can try adding another object. But since steps are limited, I need to be efficient.\n\nWait, the initial state: all objects are on the floor. Machine is off. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst command: put object 0 on the machine. Then check the result. If machine turns on, maybe 0 is a blicket. If not, then perhaps 0 isn't, or the rule is different. Then try another object. But if I do this for each object individually, I can see which ones might be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. So if I put all objects on, and the machine turns on, but that's not efficient. Maybe combinations.\n\nBut let's start simple. Let's try putting object 0 on the machine."}
