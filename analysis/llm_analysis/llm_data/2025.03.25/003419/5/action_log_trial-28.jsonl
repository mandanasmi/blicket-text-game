So the correct command is to specify \"object X\". Got it.\n\nNow, after putting 0 and 1 on the machine, the light is still off. So maybe neither 0 nor 1 are blickets. Or maybe the rule requires a certain number of blickets. Let's think of possible rules. Common ones could be:\n\n1. The machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it (OR rule).\n2. The machine turns on only if all blickets are on it (AND rule).\n3. A specific combination, like two particular ones need to be on.\n\nBut since putting 0 and 1 didn't work, maybe they aren't blickets. So perhaps try adding another object. Let's try object 2 next.

Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on, and there are more than one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when a certain number of blickets are present. For example, exactly two. But since 0 and 1 didn't work, maybe none of them are blickets. Let's test with object 2. So the next step should be putting object 2 on the machine. If the light turns on, then maybe 2 is a blicket. If not, try 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of some property (like weight?) of the objects on the machine meets a threshold. But since the user can't see that, it's about the presence of blickets. So the mutual information thing: the state of the machine's light depends on the presence of blickets. \n\nSo let's proceed. The current state: objects 0 and 1 are on the machine. Light is off. Let's add object 2. If the light turns on, then maybe 2 is a blicket. If not, then perhaps 3. Let's try that.

Let's start by recalling what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, all objects (0, 1, 2, 3) were on the floor. The machine was off. Then I tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then object 1 was added, still off. Then object 2 was added, and the machine turned on. So when objects 0, 1, and 2 are on the machine, the light comes on. But wait, maybe it's because adding object 2 triggered it. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light remained off. Then adding object 1 didn't change it. But when object 2 was added, the light turned on. That suggests that object 2 might be a blicket. But could it be a combination? Like maybe the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present, or when a specific combination is met. But since adding 2 caused it to turn on with 0 and 1 already there, maybe 2 is a blicket and the others aren't. Wait, but maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. If that's the case, then why didn't it turn on when I added object 0 or 1? So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on only when all blickets are placed on it. Or maybe it's an AND or OR condition.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But then, if 2 is a blicket, putting it alone would turn it on. But when I added 0, 1, then 2, the machine turned on when 2 was added. But maybe the machine checks when objects are added, and if any blicket is present, it turns on. But then, if object 0 or 1 was a blicket, the machine should have turned on when they were placed. Since it didn't, perhaps only object 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the presence of any blicket activates the machine. But when I put 2 on, along with 0 and 1, maybe the machine checks all objects currently on it. Wait, when I added object 2, the machine had objects 0,1,2. If the machine requires at least one blicket, then if 2 is a blicket, adding it would activate the machine. But why didn't the machine activate when 0 or 1 was added? Because they aren't blickets. So maybe object 2 is a blicket. Then the machine's rule is that it turns on when at least one blicket is on it. So in that case, when I added 2, it turned on. But then, what if I remove 2 and see if it turns off? That could confirm. But maybe I should test other combinations. Let's see.\n\nBut I have limited steps. So maybe I should test if object 2 alone is sufficient. Let me try taking off objects 0 and 1, leaving only 2 on the machine. If the machine stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, but the current state is that objects 0,1,2 are on the machine, and the light is on. Let's try removing some. For example, take object 0 off. If the machine stays on, then maybe 2 is the key. Then take object 1 off. If it's still on, then 2 is the blicket, and the rule is presence of any blicket. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But if there are multiple blickets, say 2 and 3, then putting them all on would activate. Let's see.\n\nBut first, I should check the current scenario. Objects 0,1,2 are on the machine, and the light is on. Let's take object 0 off. So take 0 off. Then check the machine's state. If the light remains on, then 0 is not a blicket, and the active ones are 1 and 2. If the light stays on, maybe 1 and/or 2 are blickets. Then take off 1. If the light remains on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is that at least one is present. Wait, but in that case, if 1 is a blicket, then when I put 1 on earlier, the machine should have turned on. But when I put 0 and then 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So that suggests that 2 is the only blicket here. But I need to test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, adding 2 would make two blickets on the machine, thus activating it. But then, if I remove 1, leaving 2, the machine would turn off. But that's a possibility. But how can I test that?\n\nSo, current state: objects 0,1,2 on machine. Light on. Let's try taking off 0 first. Take 0 off. Then, the machine has 1 and 2. If the light stays on, then either 1 or 2 is a blicket. Then take off 1. If the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then both 1 and 2 are needed. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if there's an odd number of blickets, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it. So if there are, say, two blickets, they both need to be on. But in this case, when I added 0,1,2, the light came on when 2 was added. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and there's another one. But perhaps 3 is also a blicket. So the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But I haven't tested object 3 yet. So maybe the rule is that all blickets (maybe 2 and 3) must be on the machine. Then, in the current state (0,1,2 on machine), the machine is on, but 3 is not on. That would contradict the rule. So that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. So when I added 2, which is a blicket, the machine turned on. But if there are more than one, maybe it turns off. But that's possible. Wait, but when I added 2, there were three objects on the machine, but maybe only 2 is a blicket. Then the machine would turn on. If adding another blicket (say 3) would make it turn off again. But I need to test.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step. Let's try removing objects one by one to see when the light turns off.\n\nFirst, current state: 0,1,2 on machine, light on. Let's take 0 off. So command: take object 0 off machine. Then check the light. If it's still on, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then take off 1. If the light stays on, then 2 is the blicket. If it turns off, then maybe both 1 and 2 are blickets. But in that case, when I added 1 earlier, the machine didn't turn on. So that's confusing. Because if 1 is a blicket, adding it alone should trigger the machine, but in the earlier step, when I added 1 (after 0), the machine was still off. So that suggests 1 is not a blicket. Therefore, if after removing 0 and 1, the machine remains on with only 2, then 2 is a blicket. Then the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket turns the machine on. But to confirm, perhaps remove 2 and see if the machine turns off.\n\nAlternatively, after removing 0 and 1, if the machine is still on with only 2, then 2 is a blicket. Then, if I remove 2, the machine should turn off. Let's try that.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Take object 0 off machine. If light stays on.\n\n2. Take object 1 off machine. If light stays on.\n\n3. Take object 2 off machine. Light should turn off.\n\nIf that happens, then 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is on it.\n\nBut I need to execute these steps. Let's proceed.\n\nBut wait, I need to write the next command. The last action was putting object 2 on the machine, which turned the light on. Now, the next command should be to take objects off.\n\nSo first, I'll take object 0 off the machine.\n\nCommand: take object 0 off machine.\n\nAfter that, if the light remains on, then 0 is not a blicket. Then take off 1. If light remains on, then 1 is not a blicket. Then take off 2. If light turns off, then 2 is the blicket.\n\nAlternatively, after taking 0 and 1 off, the machine has only 2. If the light is still on, then 2 is a blicket. Then removing 2 should turn it off.\n\nSo let's proceed with these steps."}
