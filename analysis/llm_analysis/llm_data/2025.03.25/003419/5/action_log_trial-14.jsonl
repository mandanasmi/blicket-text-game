So object 0 alone isn't enough. Maybe it's not a blicket, or the rule requires more than one blicket. Let's try another object. Next, I'll put object 1 on the machine along with 0 to see if combining them works. If the light turns on, then at least one of them is a blicket. If not, maybe neither or a different combination.\n\nCommand: put 1 on machine.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> put 1 on machine\n\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The machine's hum remains steady. The light on the machine is still off. \n\nThe objects are now in the following positions: object 0 is on the machine, object 1 is on the machine, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor. \n\nWhat do you do next?\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\nHmm, with objects 0 and 1 on the machine, still no light. Maybe neither is a blicket, or the rule requires a different combination. Let's try adding object 2 next. If adding 2 turns it on, then maybe one of 0,1,2 is a blicket, but only when combined with others. Or perhaps the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine.\n\nCommand: put 2 on machine.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> put 2 on machine\n\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The machine's hum becomes slightly higher in pitch. The light on the machine is still off. \n\nThe objects are now in the following positions: object 0 is on the machine, object 1 is on the machine, object 2 is on the machine, object 3 is on the floor. \n\nWhat do you do next?\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\nStill no light with 0,1,2 on the machine. Let's add the last object, 3. If the light turns on with all four, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on, and perhaps all four are blickets. Alternatively, maybe only 3 is a blicket, and it's required. Let's test.\n\nCommand: put 3 on machine.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> put 3 on machine\n\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The machine's hum suddenly increases in volume and pitch, and the light on the machine turns on! \n\nThe objects are now in the following positions: object 0 is on the machine, object 1 is on the machine, object 2 is on the machine, object 3 is on the machine. \n\nWhat do you do next?\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\nNow the light is on with all four objects. But I need to determine which are blickets. Maybe only object 3 is a blicket, and having it on the machine is sufficient. Let's test by removing others. First, take off 0,1,2, leaving only 3. If the light stays on, then 3 is the only blicket. If it turns off, maybe the rule requires multiple blickets.\n\nCommand: take 0 off machine. Then take 1 off. Then take 2 off. But need to do one command at a time. Let's start with taking 0 off.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> take 0 off machine\n\nYou take object 0 off the machine. The machine's hum decreases slightly, but the light remains on. \n\nThe objects are now in the following positions: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the machine, object 2 is on the machine, object 3 is on the machine. \n\nWhat do you do next?\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\nAfter removing 0, the light is still on.

Now remove 2. Command: take 2 off machine.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\n\n> take 2 off machine\n\nYou take object 2 off the machine.
