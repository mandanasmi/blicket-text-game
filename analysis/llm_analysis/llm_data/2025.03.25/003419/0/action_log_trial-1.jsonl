Let's start by understanding the setup. There are 8 objects, all on the floor initially. The machine is off. The rule is probably something like the machine activates when a certain number of blickets are placed on it, or maybe a specific combination.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try putting one object on the machine and see if it activates. Let's pick object 0. So I'll do 'put 0 on machine'. If the light turns on, then maybe object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or maybe more than one is needed. Let's check that.\n\nWait, but maybe the rule is more complex. Like, the machine turns on if an even number of blickets are present, or something like that. But starting with one object is a good first step to isolate variables.\n\nSo, after putting object 0 on the machine, the machine's light is still off. Hmm, so either 0 isn't a blicket, or the rule requires more than one. Maybe I need to test another object. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine next. If the machine turns on, then maybe either 0 and 1 together are blickets, or one of them is. But wait, after adding 1, if the machine turns on, but previously with 0 alone it didn't, then maybe 1 is a blicket. But maybe the rule is that the machine needs at least two blickets. So perhaps both 0 and 1 are blickets, but one alone isn't enough. Or maybe neither is, and another combination is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are placed. So I need to test different combinations.\n\nWait, let's step through possible actions. Start by testing individual objects. Put 0 on machine. If nothing happens, take it off and try 1. If none of them alone activate the machine, then maybe the rule requires two or more. Then try pairs. For example, put 0 and 1 on the machine. If that works, then maybe both are blickets. But how to know which ones? Maybe test each in isolation again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present. But in that case, putting a blicket alone should activate it. Since when I put 0 on and it didn't activate, 0 isn't a blicket. Then try 1. If 1 alone doesn't activate, then try 2, etc. But with 8 objects, that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the total number of objects on the machine, regardless of which ones. But the problem states that only blickets affect the machine. So the non-blickets don't contribute. So the machine's activation depends on the presence of one or more blickets, but perhaps with some condition. Like, exactly two blickets, or at least one, or an odd number, etc.\n\nAnother approach: try putting all objects on the machine. If the machine turns on, then there's at least one blicket. Then remove them one by one to see when it turns off. That's a possible strategy, but with 8 objects, that's 8 steps to put all on, and then 8 steps to remove. But with 32 steps, maybe manageable, but perhaps there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, binary search. Put half on, see if the machine activates. If yes, then there's a blicket in that half. Split again. If not, the blickets are in the other half. But this depends on the rule. If the rule is that any blicket present activates the machine, then this works. But if the rule is more complex, like needing exactly two, this approach might not help.\n\nSo perhaps first, test individual objects. Let's start with 0. Put 0 on machine. If machine doesn't activate, then 0 is not a blicket. Then take 0 off. Then try 1. Repeat. But this could take 8 steps (put each on, check, take off). But if none activate the machine alone, then the rule must require multiple blickets. Then start testing pairs. For example, put 0 and 1. If the machine activates, then at least one of them is a blicket. Then test each individually again. Wait, but if putting 0 and 1 together activates the machine, but neither alone does, that suggests that both are required. So the rule might be that all blickets must be present. Or that the sum of their weights (metaphorically) triggers the machine. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are placed. So if there are two blickets, putting both on will activate it. If there's only one, it won't. So if after testing all individual objects and none activate, then start testing pairs.\n\nBut with 8 objects, the number of possible pairs is 28, which is way too many steps. So perhaps a smarter approach is needed.\n\nAnother idea: put all objects on the machine. If the machine activates, then there's at least one blicket. Then remove half of them. If the machine stays on, the remaining half contains at least one blicket. If it turns off, then the removed half had all the blickets. Repeat this to narrow down. But again, this assumes the rule is that any blicket present activates the machine. If the rule is different, this might not work.\n\nBut first, let's try to test individual objects. Let's see.\n\nStep 1: put 0 on machine. Machine remains off. So 0 is not a blicket (if the rule is that any blicket activates it). Then take 0 off.\n\nStep 2: put 1 on machine. If machine turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, take it off and try 2.\n\nBut let's simulate this. Let's say I proceed to test each object one by one. Suppose none activate the machine alone. Then the rule must require more than one. Then I need to test combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an odd number of blickets are present. So even if there are two blickets, the machine would not activate. But this seems less likely. Or maybe the sum is a certain number.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates only when all blickets are on it. But if there are multiple blickets, you need all of them on the machine. So, for example, if there are three blickets, you have to put all three on. But how would you know which ones? You'd have to find a combination that activates the machine when all are present.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's start with the initial steps.\n\nFirst, let's try putting object 0 on the machine. If the machine doesn't activate, then 0 is not a blicket (assuming the rule is that at least one blicket is needed). Then take it off and try the next.\n\nBut let's see. The user says the machine's light is off. So after each action, the state is updated.\n\nWait, the initial state is all objects on the floor. So after putting 0 on the machine, the machine's status is checked. If it's still off, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then take 0 off and try 1.\n\nBut perhaps the rule requires a certain number of blickets. Let's suppose that the machine needs exactly two blickets to activate. Then testing individual objects would never activate it. So after testing all individually and getting no activation, we need to test pairs.\n\nBut with 8 objects, that's 28 pairs. But maybe there's a way to find which pair.\n\nAlternatively, if the machine activates when any two blickets are on it, then putting a group of objects and seeing activation can help narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if and only if all blickets are on it. So if there are three blickets, putting all three would activate it, but not with fewer.\n\nBut how would you know how many there are? This seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: let's try putting all objects on the machine. If the machine activates, then there are some blickets. Then remove half of them. If the machine stays on, then the remaining half has at least one blicket. Repeat this to narrow down. But this is efficient for finding at least one blicket if the rule is any.\n\nBut if the rule requires all blickets to be present, then removing one would deactivate it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present, but that's the same as the initial test.\n\nBut given that the problem states that the rule is hidden, perhaps it's a common one like requiring at least one, or exactly two, or all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the number of blickets is a multiple of a certain number. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, put object 0 on the machine.\n\nIf the machine doesn't activate, take it off. Then put object 1 on. Continue until one of them activates the machine. Suppose none do. Then the rule must require more than one. Then start testing pairs.\n\nBut with 32 steps, this might be feasible. Let's say after testing all 8 objects individually (8 steps), none activate. Then start testing pairs. For example, put 0 and 1 on. If that doesn't work, try 0 and 2, etc. But this would take many steps.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: group testing. For example, put objects 0-3 on the machine. If the machine activates, then there's at least one blicket in that group. Then split into smaller groups. This reduces the number of steps.\n\nBut first, let's see if individual testing works.\n\nSo first action: put 0 on machine. If the machine's light turns on, then 0 is a blicket, and the rule might be that at least one is needed. If not, proceed.\n\nBut in the initial scenario, after putting 0 on machine, the light is still off. So 0 is not a blicket (assuming rule is at least one). Then take 0 off.\n\nNext, put 1 on machine. If still off, take off. Then 2, etc.\n\nSuppose none activate the machine alone. Then the rule must require more than one. So next step is to test pairs.\n\nLet's say after testing all 8 individually (using 16 steps: 8 puts and 8 takes), none work. Then start testing pairs.\n\nBut with 32 steps, that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present, but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when exactly two blickets are placed, regardless of which ones. So if there are two blickets, putting any two would activate it. But that depends on the rule.\n\nAlternatively, the machine could require a specific combination. For example, objects 3 and 5 must both be on.\n\nBut that's harder to test.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if the total number of objects (blickets and non) is even, but that seems unlikely since non-blickets shouldn't affect the machine.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\"\n\nSo non-blickets have no effect. So the machine's activation depends solely on the blickets present. So the rule could be about the number of blickets (e.g., at least one, exactly two, etc.) or their specific combination.\n\nSo, back to testing. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst action: put 0 on machine.\n\nIf machine remains off, then 0 is not a blicket (if the rule is that presence of any blicket activates it). Then take 0 off and try 1.\n\nBut suppose after testing all 8 individually, none activate the machine. Then the rule must require more than one. So next step: try putting two objects. For example, 0 and 1. If that doesn't work, try 0 and 2, etc.\n\nBut with 8 objects, there are 28 possible pairs. That's a lot. But maybe there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets, then perhaps the blickets are two specific objects. So putting those two together would activate it. To find which pair, perhaps use a more efficient method.\n\nAlternatively, test groups. Put objects 0-3 on the machine. If the machine activates, then there's at least one blicket in that group. Then split into two groups: 0-1 and 2-3, and test each.\n\nBut this is getting into group testing strategies. However, with 32 steps, this might be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, after testing all individuals, put all objects on the machine. If it activates, then there's at least one blicket. Then remove half (e.g., 0-3) and see if the machine stays on. If it does, then the blickets are in the remaining half (4-7). Then split again.\n\nBut this requires that the rule is that the machine activates with any number of blickets \u22651.\n\nIf that's the case, then this approach can find at least one blicket.\n\nBut if the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets, then putting all objects might not activate it if there are more than two, but that's possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's say after testing all 8 individually, none activate. Then put all 8 on the machine. If the machine activates, then there are blickets among them. Then remove them in halves.\n\nWait, but if the machine requires exactly two blickets, and there are three, then putting all on would have three, which may not activate. So this complicates things.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Maybe the simplest initial steps are to test each object individually, then pairs, etc.\n\nBut let's proceed with the first step: put 0 on machine."}
