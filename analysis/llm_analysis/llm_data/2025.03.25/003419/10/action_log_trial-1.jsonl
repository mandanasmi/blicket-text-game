There are four objects here, numbered 0 to 3, all on the floor. The machine is off, and I need to figure out which ones are blickets and what rule makes the machine turn on. \n\nFirst, I should probably test each object individually. That way, if the machine turns on with just one object, that object might be a blicket. But maybe the rule requires more than one. Let me start by putting object 0 on the machine.\n\nSo, I'll use the command 'put 0 on machine'. Then check if the machine's light turns on. If it does, 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it needs another object. If putting 0 alone doesn't work, maybe try adding another. But let's proceed step by step."}
