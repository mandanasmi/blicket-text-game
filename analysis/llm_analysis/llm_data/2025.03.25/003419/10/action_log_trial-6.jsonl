Let's start by understanding the setup. There are four objects: 0, 1, 2, 3, all on the floor. The machine is off. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try putting one object on the machine to see if that alone activates it. Let's start with object 0. I'll put 0 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 0 might be a blicket. If not, maybe I need more objects or a different combination.\n\nWait, but what if the rule requires more than one blicket? Like, maybe the machine needs at least two blickets. Or maybe it's a specific combination. Alternatively, it could be that only certain objects are blickets, and their presence triggers the machine regardless of others. \n\nSo first step: put object 0 on machine. Let's see the result."}
