Let's start by recalling the commands I can use: look, put objects on the machine or floor, take them off, and exit. The machine's light is off right now, and all objects are on the floor.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try putting one object on the machine at a time to see if any single object activates it. That way, if the machine turns on, I know that object is a blicket. If not, maybe the rule requires more than one object. Let's start with object 0. \n\nI'll put object 0 on the machine. If the light turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or maybe the rule is more complex. But if it doesn't activate alone, I'll need to test combinations. \n\nWait, but maybe the rule is additive. Like, each blicket adds to the activation. Or maybe it's a certain number of blickets. Or perhaps their positions matter. Let's proceed step by step. \n\nAfter putting object 0 on the machine, if the machine doesn't turn on, maybe try adding another one. Let's say object 1 next. Then check the light. If it turns on, then maybe both 0 and 1 are blickets, or maybe a combination. But this could take a lot of steps. Maybe I should try pairs first. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine activates when exactly two blickets are placed. Or maybe all of them. Hmm. Let's start with individual tests. So first command: put object 0 on the machine. Then look to see the result. If the light is on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, remove it and try the next one. \n\nBut wait, the machine's state changes when objects are added, so after each action, I need to check the result. So after placing an object, I should look again to see the machine's light. \n\nAlternatively, the game might automatically tell me if the machine's state changes when I perform an action. But since the initial description says the machine's light is off, maybe after each 'put' command, the environment will update the status. \n\nSo step 1: put object 0 on the machine. Then see if the light turns on. If yes, note 0 as a blicket. If not, proceed to test other objects. \n\nIf none of the single objects activate it, then try combinations. For example, put 0 and 1 on. Then check. If that works, then maybe both are blickets. If not, try other pairs. \n\nBut to save steps, perhaps test each object alone first, then combinations.
