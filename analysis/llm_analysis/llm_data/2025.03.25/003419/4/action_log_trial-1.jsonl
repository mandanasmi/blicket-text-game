Let's start by understanding the setup. There are four objects (0-3) all on the floor, and the machine is off. The goal is to determine which are blickets and the rule. \n\nFirst, maybe I should test individual objects to see if any alone can activate the machine. Let's try putting one object on the machine at a time. That way, if the machine turns on with a single object, that object is a blicket, and the rule might be that at least one blicket is needed. But if it doesn't, maybe the rule requires multiple blickets.\n\nSo first step: put object 0 on the machine. Let's see what happens."}
