There are four objects here, numbered 0 to 3, all on the floor. The machine is off. My goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and determine the rule that makes the machine turn on. \n\nFirst, I need to test each object individually. Maybe putting one on the machine will activate it if it's a blicket. So, let me try putting object 0 on the machine.\n\n> put 0 on machine\n\nNow, the machine's light might turn on if 0 is a blicket. If it does, that's a clue. If not, maybe multiple blickets are needed. But let's see what happens after this action."}
