There are 8 objects, numbered 0 to 7, all on the floor. The machine is off. I need to figure out which ones are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The challenge is that I can't tell by looking, so I have to experiment by placing objects on the machine and observing the results.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try putting one object at a time on the machine to see if it activates. If the machine turns on with a single object, that object is a blicket. But if it doesn't, that object might not be a blicket, or the rule could require more than one. Let me start with object 0.\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nNow, after putting object 0 on the machine, I need to check if the light turns on. If it does, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not, or the rule is more complex. Let's see the result. Suppose the machine remains off. So object 0 might not be a blicket. But maybe the rule requires multiple blickets. So next, try another object, say object 1.\n\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nNow, with both 0 and 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then maybe both are blickets, or one of them. Wait, but if adding object 1 made it turn on, then either 1 is a blicket, or the combination of 0 and 1. Let's say the machine is still off. Then neither 0 nor 1 alone or together activate it. So maybe try another object, like 2.\n\n> put object 2 on machine\n\nNow three objects on the machine. If the light is still off, maybe none of these are blickets. Let's assume it's off. Then try another, say 3.\n\n> put object 3 on machine\n\nFour objects. Still off. Hmm. Maybe the rule isn't about quantity but specific objects. Perhaps certain numbers are blickets. Let's try higher-numbered objects. Let's try object 4 next.\n\n> put object 4 on machine\n\nStill off. Maybe 5?\n\n> put object 5 on machine\n\nStill off. Then 6.\n\n> put object 6 on machine\n\nIf the machine remains off, perhaps 7 is the blicket. Let's try that.\n\n> put object 7 on machine\n\nNow all objects are on the machine. If the light is still off, that would be strange. Wait, but maybe the rule isn't about having any blicket, but a specific combination. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine only activates when an even number of blickets are present, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates if exactly one blicket is present. But if I tried each one alone and none worked, then the rule is different. Or maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on it. Suppose that there are multiple blickets, and only when all are placed does the machine turn on. But how to find that without knowing how many there are.\n\nWait, maybe I should try combinations. Let's start over. Suppose after putting all objects on the machine, the machine is still off. Then the blickets might not be among them. But that can't be because the problem says some are blickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. So, if I test pairs. Let's try another approach.\n\nFirst, reset all objects to the floor. Let's take all off the machine. But since the commands are per step, perhaps I need to take them off one by one. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe start with pairs. Let me take off objects 0-7 and start fresh.\n\nBut since steps are limited, maybe try a different strategy. Let's try putting two objects at a time. Suppose I put object 0 and 1 on the machine. If the machine turns on, then at least one of them is a blicket. Then test each individually. If the machine doesn't turn on with either alone, but does when both are present, then the rule is that both are needed. Alternatively, if either one is a blicket, the machine would have turned on when either is placed. But in previous tests, perhaps none of them alone worked. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. So, need to find two that, when placed together, activate the machine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the sum of some property, like even or odd numbers. For example, if the sum of the numbers of the blickets is even, or something. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when the number of blickets on it is odd, or even. So, for example, if there are two blickets, placing both would make the machine turn on (if the rule is even), or placing one would (if odd). But without knowing the number, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blickets are objects with certain properties, like prime numbers, or even numbers. For example, objects 2, 3, 5, 7 (primes). If placing all primes on the machine activates it, then those are blickets. Or maybe even numbers: 0,2,4,6. But how to test that.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. But if none of the individual objects worked, then that's not the case. Or maybe the machine only activates when all blickets are placed. So if there are three blickets, placing all three would make it work.\n\nBut how to approach this efficiently. Let's think about possible rules:\n\n1. Single blicket: any one on the machine activates it.\n2. At least one blicket: having any number of blickets (1 or more) activates it.\n3. All blickets must be on the machine.\n4. Exactly N blickets must be on (e.g., exactly two).\n5. The number of blickets on the machine must be even/odd.\n6. Specific combination (e.g., object 1 and 3 together).\n\nGiven that, the best approach is to test individual objects first, then pairs, etc.\n\nBut in the initial tests, putting objects 0-7 one by one didn't activate the machine. So maybe none of them alone are blickets, but combinations might. Let's try putting two at a time.\n\nBut with 8 objects, there are 28 possible pairs. That's too many steps. So maybe find a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blickets are objects with even numbers. Let's test putting 0, 2, 4, 6 together.\n\n> take object 0 off machine\nBut initially, all are on the floor. Wait, previous steps were putting all on the machine. Let me reset. Wait, in the initial state, all are on the floor. Suppose the user starts by putting 0 on machine, then 1, etc. Then after putting all 8, the machine is still off. Then the user might remove some to test combinations.\n\nBut let's say after putting all 8 on the machine, the machine is off. That suggests that the rule isn't \"all blickets must be present\" unless there are more blickets not present. But the problem states that the objects in the room are the only ones. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine only activates when exactly one blicket is present, but none of the individual objects are blickets. That's impossible because the problem says some are blickets. So perhaps the rule requires a certain combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the total number of objects on it is even or odd. But that's not related to blickets. The problem says that blickets are the ones that make the machine turn on, so the rule must involve blickets.\n\nAnother idea: the machine activates if at least one blicket is present, but only if placed in a certain order. For example, the first blicket placed activates it, but subsequent ones don't. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule could be based on the sum of the blickets' numbers. For example, if their sum is a multiple of 3. But without knowing which are blickets, this is hard.\n\nWait, maybe I should try putting all even-numbered objects on the machine. Let's try that. Objects 0, 2, 4, 6.\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n> put object 2 on machine\n> put object 4 on machine\n> put object 6 on machine\n\nIf the machine activates, then perhaps the even ones are blickets. If not, maybe the odd ones. Alternatively, if the machine activates with all evens, but not when some are missing, then maybe all evens are required.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's say after putting 0,2,4,6, the machine is still off. Then try adding 1,3,5,7. Suppose after adding all, it's still off. Then the rule isn't based on even/odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blickets are 1,3,5,7 (odds). Let's try putting them all on the machine. If that activates it, then they're the blickets. But if not, then the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blickets are objects with numbers adding up to a certain value. For example, if 3 and 5 are blickets, then their sum is 8. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: Try to find a minimal set. Suppose the rule is that exactly two blickets must be on the machine. Let's test pairs. For example, put 1 and 3. If the machine activates, then those two are blickets.\n\nBut with 8 objects, this is time-consuming. Maybe use a binary search approach. Split the objects into groups. For example, first half and second half. Put objects 0-3 on the machine. If it activates, then at least one blicket is in that group. If not, the blickets are in 4-7. Then narrow down.\n\nLet's try that. First, put objects 0,1,2,3 on the machine.\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n> put object 1 on machine\n> put object 2 on machine\n> put object 3 on machine\n\nIf the machine activates, then there's at least one blicket in this group. If not, the blickets are in 4-7. Suppose it's off. Then move to 4-7.\n\n> take object 0 off machine\n> take object 1 off machine\n> take object 2 off machine\n> take object 3 off machine\n> put object 4 on machine\n> put object 5 on machine\n> put object 6 on machine\n> put object 7 on machine\n\nIf the machine activates, then the blickets are among 4-7. Suppose it's still off. Then the rule isn't about having any of these groups. Maybe the blickets are spread across both groups. Alternatively, the rule requires a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when the number of blickets is even. So if there are two blickets, putting both would activate it. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if exactly one blicket is present. But if none of the individual objects worked, then that's impossible. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are present. If there are three blickets, then all three must be on the machine. To test this, maybe put all possible combinations of three.\n\nBut again, this is time-consuming. Let's think of another approach. Suppose the blickets are objects 2 and 5. If I put them together, the machine activates. But how to find that. Maybe try pairs from different groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when a single specific object is present. For example, object 7. But when I put it alone earlier, the machine didn't activate. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates only when that object is placed last. But that's complicating the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's activation is based on the weight or order, but the problem states that the rule is hidden and based on the objects being blickets.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But in previous tests, putting individual objects didn't activate it. Then perhaps none of the objects tried so far are blickets, which is impossible because the problem states that some are. Therefore, my previous assumption that putting individual objects didn't work must be incorrect. Maybe when I put object 7 alone, the machine activated. So I need to check each step's result.\n\nBut in the current setup, I'm supposed to imagine the responses. Since I don't have actual feedback here, I need to proceed hypothetically. Let's assume that when I put object 7 on the machine alone, the machine activates. Then object 7 is a blicket. Then the rule is that having at least one blicket on the machine activates it. But then other objects may or may not be blickets. So I need to test other objects.\n\nAlternatively, if object 7 alone doesn't activate the machine, but when combined with others, maybe it's part of a required pair.\n\nThis is challenging without feedback. Let's try to outline a possible scenario.\n\nAssume that the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are placed on it. The blickets are objects 3 and 5. So placing both 3 and 5 activates the machine. So to discover this, I need to test pairs.\n\nBut testing all pairs is too many steps. Instead, I can use a strategy of elimination. For example, test half the objects in pairs, then narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, put three objects on the machine. If the machine activates, then at least two of them are blickets. Then remove one by one to see which are necessary.\n\nFor example:\n\nPut objects 0,1,2 on the machine. If it activates, then there are at least two blickets among them. Then remove 0: if it stays on, then 1 and 2 are blickets. If it turns off, then 0 and one of the others are.\n\nBut this requires observing the machine's state after each action.\n\nAlternatively, use a process of elimination. Start with all objects on the machine. If the machine is on, then there are blickets among them. Remove one by one to see when it turns off.\n\nBut again, without knowing the initial state, it's hard.\n\nAnother approach: Assume that the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is present. So to find which objects are blickets, put each one individually on the machine. The ones that activate it when alone are blickets.\n\nSo the first step would be to test each object alone. For example:\n\nStep 1: put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off \u2192 not a blicket.\nStep 2: take object 0 off.\nStep 3: put object 1 on machine \u2192 light off \u2192 not a blicket.\nAnd so on until finding an object that activates the machine when placed alone.\n\nIf none do, then the rule must require multiple blickets.\n\nIn that case, the next step is to test pairs. For example, pair 0 and 1. If the machine activates, then at least one is a blicket. Then test each individually to see which.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let's say after testing all individual objects and none activate the machine, then the rule must involve multiple blickets.\n\nSo the rule could be that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. So need to find two objects that, when placed together, activate it.\n\nTo find this efficiently, split the objects into groups and test combinations. For example:\n\nTest group A: 0,1,2,3. If placing all four doesn't activate, then the blickets are not all in this group. Then test group B:4,5,6,7. If activating, then the blickets are in group B.\n\nAlternatively, use a binary search approach.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with a possible scenario where the blickets are 2 and 5. So, placing both on the machine activates it. So, the steps would be:\n\n1. Put 2 on machine \u2192 light off.\n2. Put 5 on machine \u2192 light on. Now, both are on, so machine activates.\n3. Now, remove 5 \u2192 light off. Remove 2 \u2192 light off.\n4. So, both 2 and 5 are blickets.\n\nThus, the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present. Or exactly two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when any two blickets are present. So, if there are three blickets, placing any two would activate it.\n\nBut without feedback, it's hard to proceed. In any case, the key is to systematically test individual objects, then pairs, and observe the machine's response to narrow down the possibilities."}

So, I put all the objects one by one on the machine, and the light only turned on when I put object 7 on. That suggests that maybe object 7 is a blicket. But wait, could there be another rule here? Like, maybe the machine turns on when a certain number of objects are placed, or a combination?\n\nWait, when I added each object one by one, the light didn't come on until the 8th object (object 7) was placed. But that might mean that the rule is that all objects need to be on the machine. But there are 8 objects, and when I added the 8th, it turned on. But maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are present. So if only object 7 is a blicket, then putting it on last would trigger it. But if the rule is that at least one blicket is needed, then perhaps object 7 is the only blicket, and adding it made the machine turn on. Because before that, none of the other objects (0-6) were blickets, so when 7 was added, the machine detected a blicket and turned on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly one blicket. So when I put 7 on, which is the only blicket, it turned on. But then why didn't it turn on when I put 7 on earlier? Wait, no, because in this case, I added them one by one, each time adding the next object. So if the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present, then once I placed 7 (the blicket) on the machine, the light should have turned on immediately. But in the steps above, after adding 7, the light turned on. Wait, the previous steps: after adding 0 to 6, the light was off each time. Then adding 7 made it turn on. So the machine turned on only when 7 was placed. So maybe the rule is that the presence of object 7 (a blicket) is required. So object 7 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. But then, why didn't the machine turn on when 7 was placed alone? Wait, wait, in the steps, the user added all objects sequentially. So the first step was putting 0 on, then 1, etc., each time adding to the machine. So each time, the machine had more objects. When the 7th object (object 7) was added, the machine turned on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires all blickets to be on it. If object 7 is the only blicket, then adding it would make the machine turn on. But why did it take adding all 8 objects? Maybe the machine turns on when all blickets are present, and if there are multiple blickets, but in this case, maybe 7 is the only one. Wait, but in the initial setup, all objects are on the floor, and the user added them one by one to the machine. So when 7 was added, the machine had all 8 objects on it, but the light only turned on then. So another possibility is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it, and all blickets are objects 0-7 (so all of them), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present, and object 7 is the only blicket. But then, when I added 7, the machine would have turned on even if other objects were on it. But in this case, when I added 7, there were 8 objects on the machine, and the light turned on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires exactly one blicket, and 7 is the only one. But then, the presence of other objects doesn't matter. But in this case, when 7 was added (with all others), the light turned on, but maybe if I had added 7 alone, it would have turned on. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is odd, or some other condition. But given that the light turned on only when 7 was added, perhaps 7 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when I added 7, it would activate regardless of other objects. So maybe the machine checks each time you add an object. So adding 7, even if others are present, would trigger it. So perhaps the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket on the machine activates it. So object 7 is a blicket, and the others are not. But then, in the previous steps, when the user added 0-6, none were blickets, so the machine stayed off. Then adding 7 (a blicket) made it turn on. But then, what if the user had added 7 first? Would the machine turn on immediately? The user didn't test that. So maybe the user needs to test that scenario. However, in this case, the user added all objects in order. So perhaps the conclusion is that object 7 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. But to confirm, the user should test putting 7 alone. However, the user only has 32 steps. Let's see how many steps are left. The user has used 8 steps (putting 0-7). Then the next step is to maybe remove some objects and see. For example, take off 7 and see if the machine turns off. Let's try that. So the next command could be 'take object 7 off machine'. If the machine turns off, that would support that 7 is a blicket. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step would be to test that."}

So, the machine's light turned on only when all objects from 0 to 7 were placed on it, but then when I removed object 7, it turned off. Wait, but when I put all eight objects on the machine, the light came on. Then taking off 7 made it turn off. Hmm. Maybe the rule is that all objects need to be on the machine for it to activate. But that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I put objects 0 through 6 on the machine, the light was still off. Then adding object 7 made it turn on. So maybe the presence of object 7 is necessary. But when I took 7 off, the light went off. So perhaps object 7 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. But why did it not turn on when only 7 was on the machine? Because earlier steps had all objects from 0-6 on the machine, and then adding 7 made it turn on. Wait, no. Let me recount the steps.\n\nThe user put 0 on: light off. Then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, each time light stays off. Then when 7 is added, the light turns on. So when all eight are on, it's on. Then removing 7 turns it off. So perhaps the rule is that all objects must be on the machine. But when the user added 7, that made all eight on, so the light turned on. Then removing 7 leaves seven objects on the machine, so the light goes off. Therefore, the rule might be that all objects must be on the machine for it to activate. But in that case, all objects would be blickets? Or maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on it. But how many blickets are there? If the machine only turned on when all eight are on, then perhaps all are blickets and the rule is that all must be present. But that seems unlikely because usually in such problems, the rule is something like \"at least one blicket\" or \"a specific combination\". Wait, but in the given interaction, when all eight are on, the light is on. When any one is removed (like 7), it's off. So maybe the rule is that the machine activates when all blickets are on it. If all eight are blickets, then the rule would require all to be on. But maybe only some are blickets, and the machine requires all of them to be present. For example, if 7 is the only blicket, then putting it on would activate the machine. But in the earlier steps, when the user added 0-6, the light was off. Then adding 7 turned it on. But when 7 was removed, the light went off. So if 7 is a blicket, then the rule could be that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on. But when 7 was on the machine alone, the user didn't test that. Wait, the user's steps were putting all 0-7 on the machine, and then taking 7 off. So when 7 was on the machine along with 0-6, the light was on. But when 7 is taken off, leaving 0-6, the light is off. So perhaps the machine requires all blickets to be on. If 7 is the only blicket, then when it's added with others, the machine turns on. But if 7 is the only blicket, then even putting 7 alone should turn it on. But the user didn't test that. Let's see. The user added 0, then 1, etc., up to 7. Each time, the light was off until 7 was added. So the presence of 7 caused the light to turn on. So maybe 7 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. But why did the light turn on only when 7 was added? Because when 7 was added, the machine had all 8 objects, but if the rule is that at least one blicket is present, then even putting 7 alone should turn it on. But the user didn't test that. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket must be on the machine, and that's 7. But then when 7 is on alone, it should activate. Wait, perhaps the user needs to test that. Let me think. The user hasn't tried putting 7 alone. The user added all 0-7, then removed 7. The light turned off. So if the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket, then putting 7 alone should activate it. But since the user hasn't tried that, maybe that's the next step. So the next command should be to test putting 7 on the machine alone. If the light turns on, then 7 is a blicket and the rule is at least one. If not, then maybe the rule is that all objects are blickets and all must be on. But given that the user added all 8 and it turned on, and removing any (like 7) turns it off, that suggests that all must be present. But that would mean all 8 are blickets, which is possible but perhaps unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when an even number of blickets are present, or some other combination. But given the current observations, the most straightforward hypothesis is that object 7 is a blicket, and the rule is that at least one blicket is on the machine. But to confirm, the user needs to test putting 7 alone. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when the sum of the objects' IDs is even, but that's more complicated. So the next step should be to test putting object 7 on the machine alone to see if the light turns on. So the command would be 'put object 7 on machine'. If the light turns on, then 7 is a blicket and the rule is presence of at least one. If not, then the rule is more complex."}

So, the machine turns on when certain objects, called blickets, are placed on it. The goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine activate.\n\nFrom the previous steps, when I put all objects from 0 to 7 on the machine one by one, the light stayed off until object 7 was placed. Then it turned on. Then when I removed 7, the light went off again. Putting 7 back made it turn on again. So, object 7 is definitely a blicket. But is it the only one?\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires a specific combination. Let me check. When I put all 8 objects on the machine, the light was on. But when I took off 7, it turned off. Then putting back 7 alone made it work again. So that suggests that object 7 alone is sufficient to activate the machine. So maybe the rule is that having at least one blicket on the machine turns it on, and 7 is a blicket. But why didn't it turn on when I first placed 7? Because maybe the rule is that the machine activates only when a specific number or combination is present. Wait, no. Let me recount the steps.\n\nInitially, each object was placed one by one. So first, 0 was placed, no light. Then 1, still off. This continued up to 6, all off. Then when 7 was added, the light turned on. So when all 8 were on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 7 made it go off. Adding 7 back alone made it on again. So that suggests that 7 is a blicket, and the presence of 7 alone is enough. But why didn't the machine activate when 7 was placed the first time? Wait, when I first put 7 on the machine along with all others, the light turned on. Then when I took 7 off (leaving others), the light went off. Then putting 7 back on (without the others) turned it on again. So that shows that 7 alone is sufficient. But why when I placed 7 initially with others (all 0-7), the light was on, but when I took 7 off, the others (0-6) didn't keep it on. So that implies that none of 0-6 are blickets. So the rule is that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket on it, and 7 is the only blicket. But let me verify.\n\nWait, when I put 0-7 all on the machine, the light came on. Then removing 7 (leaving 0-6) turned it off. Then putting 7 back on (so 0-6 are off, only 7 is on) turned it on. So that's consistent. So object 7 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present. Therefore, the other objects (0-6) are not blickets. But is there a possibility that multiple blickets are required, and 7 is just one of them? For example, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket, and 7 is the only one. Or maybe it's additive. But in the case where only 7 is on, it works. So the minimal case is 7 alone. Thus, the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket (object 7) activates the machine. Therefore, the blickets are object 7, and the rule is the machine turns on when any blicket is on it. But wait, let's check another scenario to confirm. Let me try putting 7 and another object, say 0, on the machine. If the machine stays on, then the presence of 7 is sufficient. Alternatively, if I take 7 off and leave others, it's off. So yes, that's the case. But in the given steps, after putting all 0-7 on, the light was on. Then taking 7 off (leaving 0-6) turned it off. Then putting 7 back (alone) turned it on. So that confirms that 7 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. Therefore, the answer should be that object 7 is a blicket, and the rule is the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. But wait, maybe the rule is different. For example, maybe the machine only activates when exactly one blicket is present. But when I placed 7 alone, it worked. If there were other blickets, adding them would still work. But since none of the others worked when placed individually, that's not the case. So I think the conclusion is correct. Object 7 is the only blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it."}

When objects 0 through 6 were each added individually, the machine didn't turn on. That implies none of them alone can activate the machine. But maybe the rule is that the machine requires a specific combination or a certain number of blickets. However, when all eight were on the machine, the light was on. But wait, when they added object 7 last, that's when it turned on. So maybe the machine activates when object 7 is present, regardless of others. But when they took 7 off and left the others, the machine turned off. Then putting only 7 back on turned it on again. So this seems like object 7 is the only blicket here. The rule might be that the machine activates if and only if at least one blicket (which is object 7) is on it. Therefore, object 4, which was placed on the machine alone without 7, didn't activate it. So object 4 is not a blicket."}

Putting object 7 back on made the light turn on once more.\n\nThis suggests that the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 7 is on it, regardless of the other objects. Since object 5 was on the machine along with others (including 7) when the light turned on, but when object 5 was on without 7 (as in the earlier steps when only 0-6 were placed), the light didn't activate. Therefore, object 5's presence alone or with others except 7 didn't trigger the machine. The key factor seems to be object 7. Hence, object 5 is not a blicket.

Then, when they removed 7 and put it back, the machine turned on again. \n\nFrom this, it looks like object 7 is definitely a blicket because the machine activates when it's on.

Even when all objects from 0-6 were on the machine, it stayed off. Only when 7 was added did it activate.\n\nSo, the rule might be that the machine requires at least one blicket to be present.
