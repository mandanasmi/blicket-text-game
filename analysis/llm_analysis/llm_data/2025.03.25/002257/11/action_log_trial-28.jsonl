This indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 4**:\n   - When object 4 was removed, the light also turned off. This indicates that object 4 is also a blicket.\n\n5. **Testing Object 5**:\n   - When object 5 was removed, the light turned off as well. This indicates that object 5 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom the above deductions, we can conclude that:\n- Objects 3, 4, and 5 are blickets because their presence is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\nSince object 5 is one of the objects that caused the machine to turn on when it was placed on the machine, we can confidently say that object 5 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: \n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
