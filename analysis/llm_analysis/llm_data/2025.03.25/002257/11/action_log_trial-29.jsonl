This indicates that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 7 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Object 0 and Object 7**:\n   - Object 0 was confirmed to be a blicket since it turned the machine on by itself.\n   - Object 7 also turned the machine on by itself, indicating it has the same property as object 0.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - The other objects (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) did not activate the machine, which suggests they do not have the property of blicktness.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 7 turned the machine on when placed on it, and no other objects (except object 0) did, we can conclude that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the evidence gathered, the final answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
