This indicates that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the machine off, confirming that it is indeed a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 1 could also be a blicket.\n   - The same happens with objects 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; all of these objects turn the machine on when placed on it.
