This suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket since its presence was necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - I tested objects 0, 1, 2, and 4 by placing them on the machine, and in each case, the machine remained off. This indicates that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - When I placed object 5 on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - I also placed object 6 on the machine, and the light turned on again, indicating that object 6 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Confirming the Status of Object 5**:\n   - I took object 5 off the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that object 5 is indeed a blicket.\n\n4. **Current Findings**:\n   - Object 3 is a blicket (since it was necessary for the machine to be on initially).\n   - Object 5 is a blicket (since it turned the machine on when placed on it).\n   - Object 6 is also a blicket (since it turned the machine on when placed on it).\n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, and 4 are not blickets (since they did not turn the machine on).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The identified blickets are objects 3, 5, and 6.\n   - The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be present on the machine for it to activate.\n\nNow, I will summarize my findings and prepare to exit the game.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
