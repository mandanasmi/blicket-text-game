This indicates that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was tested again and turned the machine on, confirming its blicket status.\n\n4. **Conclusion about Object 6**:\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine and the light was off when it was removed. This suggests that object 6 does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n   - Since the machine was off when object 6 was the only object on the machine, and it was not a necessary condition for the machine to be on when other objects were present, we can conclude that object 6 does not have blicktness.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 6 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
