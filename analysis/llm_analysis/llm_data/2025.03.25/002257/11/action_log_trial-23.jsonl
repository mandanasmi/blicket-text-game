This suggests that object 6 is also likely a blicket.\n\n6. **Removing Object 5**: I took object 5 off the machine, and the machine turned off. This confirms that object 5 is indeed a blicket, as its removal caused the machine to turn off.\n\n7. **Current Findings**: \n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not blickets (as they did not activate the machine).\n   - Objects 5 and 6 are likely blickets (as they activated the machine when placed on it).\n\n8. **Next Steps**: To further confirm the status of object 6, I could remove object 6 and see if the machine turns off. However, since I have already established that object 5 is a blicket and the machine's state changes with its presence, I can conclude that both objects 5 and 6 are blickets.\n\n9. **Inferring the Rule**: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it. Since both objects 5 and 6 activated the machine, the rule likely involves the presence of one or more blickets.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I will now take the next action to confirm the status of object 6.\n\n> take object 6 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
