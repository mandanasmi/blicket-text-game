This suggests that at least one of the other objects (1-6) is responsible for keeping the machine on, or that the machine has a property that allows it to stay on even when certain objects are removed.\n\n3. **Identifying Blickets**: \n   - Since object 0 did not turn the machine on, it is likely not a blicket. \n   - Objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are candidates for being blickets, but we need to determine which ones are responsible for the machine being on.\n\n4. **Testing Combinations**: \n   - To further investigate, I can test combinations of the objects that turned the machine on.

This suggests that the machine's state (light on) is not solely dependent on any single object being present.\n\n3. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - Attempts to put combinations of objects (like object 1 and object 2) on the machine resulted in the light being on, but the system did not recognize the combinations correctly, indicating that the machine's response is not straightforwardly additive or dependent on specific combinations.\n\n4. **Focus on Object 6**:\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine and the light turned on. However, we also saw that the light remained on even when other objects were removed, which complicates the inference about object 6 being a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light was on with object 6 on the machine, it suggests that object 6 could be a blicket. However, the fact that the light remained on even when other objects were removed indicates that the machine's state is not solely dependent on object 6. \n\nGiven that the machine's light was on with object 6 present, but also remained on when other objects were removed, we cannot definitively conclude that object 6 is a blicket.
