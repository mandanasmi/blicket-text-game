This indicates that object 5 is not necessary for the machine to be on, suggesting that it may not be a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - Similarly, when object 3 and object 4 were removed, the light also turned off, indicating that both are likely blickets.\n\n3. **Testing Object 5**:\n   - Object 5 was placed on the machine and the light turned on, but when it was removed, the light remained on. This suggests that the machine can still be activated by other objects even without object 5 present.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light remained on after removing object 5, it indicates that object 5 does not have a direct influence on the machine's state.
