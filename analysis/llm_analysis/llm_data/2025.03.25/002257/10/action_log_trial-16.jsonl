Since the light remains on when I remove objects, I can try to isolate the blickets by testing them in pairs or groups.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I will first test object 1 and object 2 together to see if they activate the machine.

This indicates that object 6 is likely a blicket as well.\n\n5. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - So far, it seems that the machine turns on when at least one of the objects placed on it is a blicket. Since the light remains on even when I remove objects that previously turned it on, it suggests that there may be multiple blickets among the objects tested.\n\n6. **Next Steps**:\n   - To further narrow down which objects are blickets, I should test the remaining objects (2 and 6) more systematically.

This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - I then put object 1 on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n   - I continued to put objects 2, 3, 4, and 5 on the machine, and the light remained on for all of them.

This indicates that object 5 is not necessary for the machine to stay on, suggesting that at least one of the other objects (1, 2, 3, or 4) is sufficient to keep the machine on.\n   - I repeated this process for objects 4, 3, and 0, and the light remained on each time. This reinforces the idea that the machine can stay on with at least one of the other objects.\n\n4. **Testing Remaining Objects**:\n   - I put object 6 on the machine, and the light was still on.

This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**:\n   - When I took object 5, 4, 3, and 0 off the machine, the light remained on. This indicates that these objects do not affect the machine's state negatively when removed, suggesting they might not be blickets.\n   - However, when I took object 2 off the machine, the light turned off. This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket since its removal caused the machine to turn off.\n\n3. **Further Testing**:\n   - I placed object 6 and object 7 on the machine, and the light remained on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is also a blicket.\n   - When I took object 6 off the machine, the light remained on, indicating that object 6 is not a blicket. \n   - The same goes for object 1, which I took off the machine, and the light remained on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, it seems that object 2 is definitely a blicket since its removal turned the machine off.\n   - Object 1, 3, 4, and 5 do not seem to affect the machine negatively when removed, suggesting they are not blickets.\n   - Object 6 is also not a blicket since the light remained on after its removal.\n   - Object 7 is still on the machine, and since the light is on, it could potentially be a blicket.\n\n5. **Next Steps**:\n   - To confirm the status of object 7, I will take it off the machine and see if the light turns off.

This indicates that at least one of the remaining objects (1, 2, 6, or 7) is a blicket.\n   - When we removed object 2, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When we removed object 7, the light also turned off, indicating that object 7 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light turned off when object 7 was removed, it confirms that object 7 must be a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the evidence gathered, object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
