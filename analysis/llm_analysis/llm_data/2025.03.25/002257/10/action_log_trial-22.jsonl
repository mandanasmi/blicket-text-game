This indicates that object 2 has some property (blicktness) that activates the machine.\n\n2. **Further Testing**:\n   - Objects 3, 4, 5, and 6 also turn the machine on when placed on it. This suggests that they may also be blickets.\n   - When object 6 is removed, the light remains on, indicating that object 6 is not necessary for the machine to stay on, which suggests that at least one of the other objects (2, 3, 4, or 5) is sufficient to keep the machine activated.\n   - When object 2 is removed, the light remains on, indicating that object 2 is not the only object that can activate the machine.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - When object 4 is removed, the light also turns off, indicating that object 4 is a blicket as well.\n   - Object 5 was placed on the machine, and the light was on, but when I tried to put it back on, it indicated that it was already on, and the light was off.
