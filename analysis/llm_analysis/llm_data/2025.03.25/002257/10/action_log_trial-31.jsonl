This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - When I take object 0 off, the light remains on, indicating that object 1 is sufficient to keep the machine on.\n   - When I take object 1 off, the light turns off, confirming that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - I put object 2 on the machine, and the light is off. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - I put object 0 back on the machine, and the light turns on again, confirming that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - I then put object 3 on the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n   - I put object 4 on the machine, and the light turns on, suggesting that object 4 is also a blicket.\n   - I put object 5 on the machine, and the light turns on, suggesting that object 5 is also a blicket.\n   - I put object 6 on the machine, and the light turns on, suggesting that object 6 is also a blicket.\n   - I took object 3 off the machine, and the light remains on, indicating that at least one of the other objects (0, 1, 4, 5, or 6) is sufficient to keep the machine on.\n\n3. **Final Testing**:\n   - I put object 7 on the machine, and the light turns on, suggesting that object 7 is also a blicket.\n   - I tried to take object 3 off, but it was already off, and the light remained on, confirming that the machine can stay on without it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, the objects that are confirmed to be blickets are: object 0, object 1, object 3, object 4, object 5, object 6, and object 7.\n   - Object 2 is confirmed to not be a blicket.\n\n5. **Rule Inference**:\n   - The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it. Since multiple objects can be blickets, the presence of any one of them is sufficient to activate the machine.\n\nNow, I will proceed to take a final action to confirm my findings.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
