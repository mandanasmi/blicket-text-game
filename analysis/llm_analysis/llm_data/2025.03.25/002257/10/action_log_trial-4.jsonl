This confirms that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - We then removed object 4 from the machine, and the light turned off as well. This indicates that object 4 is not a blicket, as the machine only turned on when it was present, but it did not keep the machine on when removed.\n\n3. **Further Testing with Other Objects**:\n   - We placed object 5 on the machine, and the light turned on, suggesting that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - The same happened with objects 6 and 7, which also turned the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - However, when we removed objects 5 and 6, the light turned off, confirming that they are also blickets.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 4 was on the machine and the light turned on, but then turned off when it was removed, it indicates that object 4 does not have blicktness. The light only turned on due to the presence of other objects (like object 3, which we confirmed is a blicket).\n\nBased on this reasoning, we conclude that object 4 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
