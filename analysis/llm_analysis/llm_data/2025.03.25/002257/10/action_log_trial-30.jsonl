This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When I put **object 1** on the machine, the light turns on. This indicates that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n   - When I put **object 2** on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - The same happens with **objects 3, 4, 5, and 6**; the light remains on when they are placed on the machine. This indicates that all of these objects (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are likely blickets.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - When I take **object 1** off the machine, the light remains on. This suggests that the machine is still detecting blicktness from one or more of the other objects (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n   - The same is true for **objects 2 and 3**; removing them does not turn off the machine, indicating that at least one of the remaining objects (4, 5, or 6) is also a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light remains on after removing objects 1, 2, and 3, it is clear that at least one of the objects 4, 5, or 6 must also be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is confirmed not to be a blicket since it did not activate the machine.\n\n5. **Next Steps**:\n   - To further narrow down which of the remaining objects (4, 5, or 6) are blickets, I will need to test them individually or in combinations. However, since I have already established that objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are likely blickets, I can conclude that the rule for the machine turning on is likely related to the presence of any of these objects.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will now take the next logical step to confirm the status of the remaining objects.

This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 4**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 5**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 6**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - When we removed **object 1**, the light remained on.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
