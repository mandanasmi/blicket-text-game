This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 is also likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing**:\n   - After removing object 2, the machine turns off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 also turns the machine off, indicating that object 3 is also a blicket.\n   - When I put object 3 back on the machine, the light remains off, which is inconsistent with the previous observation. This suggests that the machine's behavior might depend on the combination of objects rather than just individual objects.\n\n4. **Revisiting Object 1 and Object 0**:\n   - Both object 0 and object 1 have consistently failed to turn the machine on, indicating they are not blickets.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, we can conclude:\n     - **Blickets**: Object 2 and Object 3\n     - **Non-blickets**: Object 0 and Object 1\n   - The rule for the machine seems to be that it turns on when at least one blicket is present on it.
