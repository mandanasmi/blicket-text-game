You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

This indicates that neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This indicates that object 3 could potentially be a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Object 2 and Object 3**:\n   - After removing object 2 from the machine, the light turned off. This confirms that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - After removing object 3 from the machine, the light also turned off. This means that the machine does not turn on with just object 3 alone, which raises a question about its status as a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 3 was able to turn the machine on when it was placed on the machine, it suggests that it might be a blicket. However, since the light turned off when both object 2 and object 3 were removed, and we know that object 2 is a blicket, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket. The light turning on with object 3 could be due to the presence of object 2.\n\nThus, based on the evidence, we cannot confirm that object 3 is a blicket because it was only tested in conjunction with object 2, which we know is a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
