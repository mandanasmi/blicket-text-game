This suggests that object 1 does not activate the machine.\n   - After placing object 1 on the machine, I also placed object 2 again, and the light turned on, but this does not provide any new information about object 1.\n\n3. **Further Testing**:\n   - I took object 1 off the machine, and the light turned off, which is consistent with the previous observation that object 1 does not activate the machine.\n   - I also noted that when object 1 was placed on the machine while object 2 was already there, the light remained on, but this is due to object 2 being a blicket, not object 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 1 did not activate the machine when placed on it, and the light was off both times it was tested, we can conclude that object 1 does not have blicktness.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence gathered, object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
