The machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since both object 1 and object 2 turned the machine on when placed, and removing either of them turned it off, it seems that the machine requires at least one of these two objects to be present to activate.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now summarize my findings:\n- **Blickets**: Object 1 and Object 2\n- **Rule**: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it.\n\nNow, I will proceed to take action based on this understanding.
