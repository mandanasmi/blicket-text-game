You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This indicates that object 3 could potentially be a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Object 2 and Object 3**:\n   - After removing object 2 from the machine, the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was removed from the machine, the light also turned off. This means that the machine only turned on when object 2 was present, and it did not remain on when object 3 was removed.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light turned on with object 2 and turned off when both object 2 and object 3 were removed, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket. The light turning on with object 3 present could have been due to object 2 being the only blicket.\n   - Therefore, we cannot say for certain that object 3 is a blicket based on the evidence gathered.\n\nThus, the answer to whether object 3 is a blicket is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
