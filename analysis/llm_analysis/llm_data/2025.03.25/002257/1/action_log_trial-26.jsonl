This suggests that the machine only accepts one object at a time.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I need to test combinations of objects to see if any other object can work with object 3 to turn the machine on.\n   - I will take object 3 off the machine and then try putting object 1 on the machine with object 3.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - Since I have already established that object 3 can turn the machine on, I will now test if object 1 can work with it. \n\nThus, the command I will execute is:\n\n> put object 1 on machine with object 3", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This suggests that the machine only accepts one object at a time.\n   - I took object 3 off the machine again, confirming it was off.\n\n5. **Further Testing**:\n   - I tried to put object 1 and object 2 on the machine with object 3, but those commands were invalid as well.\n   - I took object 3 off the machine again, confirming it was off.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 3 is likely a blicket, but it seems that it may need to be combined with another object to activate the machine.\n   - Since all other objects (0, 1, 2) did not activate the machine when tested individually, they are likely not blickets.\n\n7. **Next Steps**:\n   - I will now test object 3 with another object to see if it activates the machine.

This indicates that the machine does not turn on with just object 3 alone, suggesting that there may be a combination rule or that object 3 needs to be combined with another object to activate the machine.\n\n3. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I attempted to place object 0, 1, and 2 on the machine with object 3, but the commands were invalid.
