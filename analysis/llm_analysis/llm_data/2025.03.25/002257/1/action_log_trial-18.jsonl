This indicates that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on. This suggests that object 2 could be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on again.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.
