This suggests that the machine is already activated, and I cannot manipulate the objects as intended.\n\nGiven that the light on the machine is consistently on, it indicates that at least one object (object 6, which is on the machine) is likely a blicket, or there is some other condition that keeps the machine activated. However, I cannot confirm the status of object 6 or any other objects since I cannot interact with them.\n\nTo gather more information, I will try to remove object 6 from the machine, as it is the only object currently on it. This will help me determine if the machine turns off when I attempt to take it off, which could indicate that object 6 is indeed a blicket. \n\nSince I have already tried to take object 6 off the machine multiple times without success, I will instead try to put another object on the machine to see if it affects the machine's state.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.
