This indicates that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - I removed object 5, and the light turned off. This indicates that object 5 is also a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - So far, we have confirmed that objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are blickets. Object 0 is definitely not a blicket.\n   - The machine can be on with any combination of objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, but it seems that objects 4 and 5 are essential for the machine to be on.\n\n5. **Next Steps**:\n   - To further narrow down the blickets, I will take off object 6 and see if the machine remains on. If it does, then object 6 is not a blicket.
