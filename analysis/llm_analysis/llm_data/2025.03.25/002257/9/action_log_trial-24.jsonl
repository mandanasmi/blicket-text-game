This suggests that both objects 6 and 7 could potentially be blickets.\n\n4. **Final Analysis**:\n   - Since we have not tested object 6 or 7 in isolation (i.e., we have not removed both of them to see if the light turns off), we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket based solely on the information we have.\n   - However, since the light turned on with object 7 on the machine, it is likely that it is a blicket, but we cannot confirm it without further testing.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we conclude that we cannot definitively say that object 7 is a blicket based on the current evidence.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
