We took object 2 off, and the machine turned off. This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket since it was the only object on the machine when it was on.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - We put object 0 on the machine, and the light was off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - We put object 1 on the machine, and the light was off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - We put object 3 on the machine, and the light was on.
