This suggests that neither object 2 nor object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were placed on the machine, and the light turned on each time. This indicates that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**:\n   - I took object 0 off the machine, and the light remained on. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket, but at least one of the other objects (1, 4, 5, 6, or 7) must be.\n   - I took object 1 off the machine, and the light remained on.

This indicates that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - The same happened with objects 5 and 6; when they were taken off, the light turned off, indicating that both of these objects are also blickets.\n   - Finally, when object 7 was taken off, the light turned off, indicating that object 7 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light turned off when object 5 was taken off the machine, it confirms that object 5 is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the reasoning above, the answer to whether object 5 is a blicket is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
