Every attempt to take an object off the machine or put an object on the machine has resulted in the response that the object is not recognized, and the machine's light has remained off throughout the entire interaction.\n\nGiven that I have not been able to gather any evidence or data regarding the objects' properties or their relationship to the machine, I cannot conclude whether object 7 is a blicket or not.
