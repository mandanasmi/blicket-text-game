This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - The same happened with objects 4, 5, 6, and 7; the light turned on when they were placed on the machine. This suggests that at least one of these objects is also a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing for Independence**:\n   - I removed object 7 from the machine, and the light remained on. This indicates that object 7 is not necessary for the machine to be on, suggesting that it is not a blicket.\n   - When I removed object 3, the light turned off. This confirms that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Removing object 4 also turned the light off, confirming that object 4 is a blicket as well.\n   - I attempted to remove object 5, but it was already on the machine, and the light was off, indicating that it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Tests**:\n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, and 7 are not blickets.\n   - Objects 3 and 4 are confirmed as blickets.\n   - Object 5 is not a blicket since the light was off when it was placed on the machine alone.\n   - I need to further test object 6 to confirm its status.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I will take object 6 off the machine to see if the light turns off.

This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - When I placed object 3 on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - The same happened with objects 4, 5, 6, and 7; the light turned on when each of these objects was placed on the machine.\n\n2. **Testing for Independence**:\n   - I removed object 3 from the machine, and the light turned off. This confirms that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - I removed object 4, and the light turned off again, confirming that object 4 is also a blicket.\n   - I removed object 6, and the light turned off, confirming that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was already on the machine when I tried to take it off, and the light was off, indicating that it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, I can conclude that objects 3, 4, and 6 are blickets because their presence on the machine is necessary for the light to turn on.\n   - Object 5 is not a blicket since the light did not turn on when it was the only object on the machine.\n\n4. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. Since I have identified objects 3, 4, and 6 as blickets, I can confidently state that the machine requires at least one of these objects to be present to turn on.\n\nNow, I will exit the game since I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - The same happened with objects 4, 5, 6, and 7; the light turned on when any of these objects were placed on the machine.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**:\n   - After placing object 3 on the machine and then removing it, the light turned off, confirming that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - When object 4 was removed, the light also turned off, indicating that object 4 is a blicket as well.\n   - When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light was on, but when I tried to take it off, I mistakenly attempted to take off object 3 again, which was already off the machine.
