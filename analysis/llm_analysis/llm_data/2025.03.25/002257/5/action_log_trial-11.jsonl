This suggests that neither object 3 nor object 4 is a blicket, as their removal did not affect the machine's state.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**: \n   - I then placed objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine, one at a time, and the machine remained off. This indicates that none of these objects (0, 1, or 2) are blickets either.\n\n4. **Identifying a Potential Blicket**: \n   - When I placed object 5 on the machine, the light turned on.
