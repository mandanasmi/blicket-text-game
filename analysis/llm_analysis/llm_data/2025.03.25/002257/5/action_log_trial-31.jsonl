However, we need to consider if it is the only object responsible for the machine being on.\n   - Since the light was on with object 3, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket without further testing.\n\n5. **Final Consideration**:\n   - The machine was on with object 3, but it was also on with other objects (2, 4, and 5). We cannot isolate the effect of object 3 without additional tests.\n   - Since we have not tested object 3 in isolation or with combinations that exclude other known blickets, we cannot confirm its status as a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket because we lack sufficient evidence to isolate its effect on the machine.

This suggests that object 6 could be a blicket.\n   - However, we need to consider the state of the machine when other objects are removed. When object 2 was removed, the machine turned off, indicating that object 2 is likely a blicket. \n   - When object 1 was removed, the machine turned off, indicating that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 6 turned the machine on when placed, it is likely a blicket. However, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket without further testing, as it could be that the machine is on due to the presence of other objects that are already known to activate the machine.\n\nGiven the evidence, while object 6 did activate the machine, we cannot confirm it as a blicket without additional tests to isolate its effect.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
