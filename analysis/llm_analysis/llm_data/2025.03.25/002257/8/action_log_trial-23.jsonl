Based on the interactions, it seems that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since both objects 1 and 3 turned the machine on when placed, the rule could be that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present.\n\nNow, I will summarize my findings:\n- **Blickets**: Object 1 and Object 3\n- **Rule**: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it.\n\nSince I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule, I will exit the task.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
