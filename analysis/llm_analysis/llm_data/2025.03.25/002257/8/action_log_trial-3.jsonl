This confirms that object 1 is indeed a blicket, as removing it caused the machine to turn off.\n5. **Fourth Interaction**: I put object 2 on the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket, as it activated the machine.\n6. **Fifth Interaction**: I put object 3 on the machine, and the light turns on. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket as well, since it activated the machine.\n\nFrom these interactions, we can summarize the following:\n\n- Object 0: Not a blicket (light off when placed on the machine).\n- Object 1: A blicket (light on when placed on the machine, off when removed).\n- Object 2: A blicket (light on when placed on the machine).\n- Object 3: A blicket (light on when placed on the machine).\n\nNow, we need to determine the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. Based on the interactions, it seems that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since objects 1, 2, and 3 all activated the machine, the rule could be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present.\n\nTo confirm this, I will now take all the blickets (objects 1, 2, and 3) off the machine and then put them back on one by one to see if the machine consistently turns on with each one.\n\nNext, I will take object 2 off the machine and then put object 1 back on to confirm its status as a blicket.\n\n> take object 2 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
