This suggests that object 0 contributes to the machine being on.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - I put object 1 on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - I put object 2 on the machine, and the light remained on. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - I took object 1 off the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n   - I took object 2 off the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is also a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 3**:\n   - Object 3 was on the machine initially, but when I tried to put it on again, the light remained off. This suggests that object 3 does not contribute to the machine being on.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since removing object 0 turned the light off, it indicates that object 0 is a blicket. The same reasoning applies to objects 1 and 2, which also turned the light on when placed on the machine. Object 3, however, does not contribute to the machine being on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
