This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - I put object 1 back on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that the presence of other objects might influence the machine's state.\n\n4. **Testing Object 2**:\n   - I put object 2 on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests that object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - I then put object 3 on the machine, and the light remained on. This suggests that object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I put object 1 on the machine again, and the light remained on. This indicates that the presence of either object 0, 2, or 3 is keeping the machine on, but object 1 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - I took object 1 off the machine, and the light remained on, indicating that object 1 does not contribute to the machine being on.\n\n6. **Final Analysis**:\n   - From the tests, I can conclude:\n     - Object 0 is a blicket (it turned the machine on by itself).\n     - Object 2 is a blicket (it turned the machine on by itself).\n     - Object 3 is likely a blicket (it turned the machine on when combined with other objects).\n     - Object 1 is not a blicket (it did not turn the machine on by itself).\n\n7. **Inferences about the Rule**:\n   - The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. The presence of non-blickets does not affect the machine's state if a blicket is present.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now test the combination of objects 0, 2, and 3 to confirm their status as blickets.\n\n> put object 0 on machine, put object 2 on machine, put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
