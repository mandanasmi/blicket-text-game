This reinforces the idea that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3**:\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. However, we need to consider whether object 3 is the sole cause of the machine turning on or if it could be due to the presence of another object.\n   - Since I have not tested object 3 in combination with other objects (like object 1), I cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket based solely on the information gathered.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 3 turned the machine on when placed alone, but without further testing (like placing it with object 0 or 2), I cannot confirm that it is a blicket. It could be that the machine turns on with a combination of objects or that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nGiven the current evidence, I cannot definitively say that object 3 is a blicket based on the interactions observed.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
