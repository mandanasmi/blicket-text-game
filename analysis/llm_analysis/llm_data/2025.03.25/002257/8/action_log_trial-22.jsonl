This suggests that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n   - When I took object 0 off, the light turned off, confirming that object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - I then put object 1 on the machine, and the light turned on.

This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, confirming that object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.

This suggests that object 2 could also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

The same applies to object 2.\n   - Object 3 also turns the light on, but we have not tested it in isolation to see if it can turn the light on by itself or if it is dependent on the other objects.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 3 can turn the light on when placed on the machine, it is likely a blicket. However, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket without isolating it from the other objects to see if it can turn the light on by itself.\n   - Given that the light turns on with object 3 present, it suggests that it has some relationship with the machine, but we lack the definitive test to confirm its status as a blicket.\n\nBased on the evidence, while it is highly probable that object 3 is a blicket, we cannot be certain without further testing.
