This indicates that object 2 is not necessary for the machine to stay on, which suggests that object 3 must also be a blicket since the machine is still on without object 2.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, I conclude that:\n     - Object 0 is not a blicket.\n     - Object 1 is not a blicket.\n     - Object 2 is a blicket.\n     - Object 3 is a blicket.\n\n6. **Rule Inference**:\n   - The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one of the objects on the machine must be a blicket.
