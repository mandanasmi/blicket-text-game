This suggests that object 0 is either a blicket or that the machine has a rule that allows it to turn on with object 0.\n3. **Second Action**: I put object 1 on the machine, and the light remains on. This indicates that object 1 is also likely a blicket, or that the machine can turn on with either object 0 or object 1.\n4. **Third Action**: I take object 0 off the machine, and the light turns off. This confirms that object 0 is indeed a blicket because its removal caused the machine to turn off.\n5. **Fourth Action**: I attempt to put object 1 back on the machine, but it is already there, and the light is off. This suggests that object 1 alone does not activate the machine, indicating that it might not be a blicket after all.\n6. **Fifth Action**: I put object 2 on the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom these interactions, we can infer the following:\n- Object 0 is a blicket because it turned the machine on when placed on it and caused it to turn off when removed.\n- Object 1 is likely not a blicket since it did not turn the machine on by itself after object 0 was removed.\n- Object 2 is a blicket because it turned the machine on when placed on it.\n\nNow, we need to determine the rule for how the machine turns on. Based on the interactions:\n- The machine turns on with object 0 and object 2, but not with object 1 alone. This suggests that the machine may require at least one of the objects (0 or 2) to be present to turn on.\n\nNext, I will test object 3 to see if it can also activate the machine. \n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
