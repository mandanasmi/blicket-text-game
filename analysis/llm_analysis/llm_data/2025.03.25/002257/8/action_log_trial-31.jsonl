Based on the interactions, it seems that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since both object 0 and object 3 turned the machine on, the rule could be that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present.\n\nTo confirm this, I will put both object 0 and object 3 on the machine together to see if the machine turns on again.\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This indicates that object 0 is likely a blicket since its presence directly influenced the machine's state.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light also remained off. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket either.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket since its presence also influenced the machine's state.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - We have established that object 0 is a blicket because it turned the machine on by itself.\n   - Object 1 and object 2 do not turn the machine on, indicating they are not blickets.\n   - Object 3 turned the machine on when placed on it, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\nSince object 3 has shown the ability to turn the machine on, we conclude that it is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
