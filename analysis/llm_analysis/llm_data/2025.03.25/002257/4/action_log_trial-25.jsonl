You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 7 is likely a blicket, as it is the only object that caused the machine to activate.\n\n3. **Removing Object 6**: \n   - After removing object 6 from the machine, the light remained off. This means that object 6 does not contribute to the machine turning on, reinforcing the idea that it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since all other objects (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) did not activate the machine, and only object 7 did, we can conclude that object 7 must be a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence gathered, object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
