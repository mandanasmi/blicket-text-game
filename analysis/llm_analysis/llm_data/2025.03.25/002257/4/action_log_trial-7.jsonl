This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - I then tested object 4, and the machine turned on again, suggesting that object 4 is also a blicket.\n   - I continued testing with object 5, and the machine turned on again, indicating that object 5 is a blicket as well.\n   - Object 6 and object 7 were also tested, and the machine remained on, suggesting that both of these objects are also blickets.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - When I removed object 0, the machine turned off, confirming that it is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turned the machine off, indicating that it is indeed a blicket.\n   - The same happened with objects 4, 5, and 6; removing any of these turned the machine off, confirming they are blickets.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The objects that turned the machine on are: 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - The objects that did not turn the machine on are: 0, 1, and 2.\n\n5. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - The rule seems to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it.
