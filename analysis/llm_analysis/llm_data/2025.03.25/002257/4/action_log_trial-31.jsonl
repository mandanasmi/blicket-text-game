This suggests that none of these objects (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are blickets.\n\n2. **Further Testing**:\n   - When we placed object 6 on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - When we placed object 7 on the machine, the light also turned on. However, when we took object 7 off, the light remained on, indicating that object 6 alone was sufficient to keep the machine on. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket since it did not contribute to the machine being on when object 6 was removed.\n\n3. **Final Tests**:\n   - We took object 6 off the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that object 6 is indeed a blicket.\n   - We then placed object 7 back on the machine, and the light remained off, confirming that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 did not activate the machine at all, and since object 6 is confirmed as a blicket, we can conclude that object 5 is not a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer to whether object 5 is a blicket is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
