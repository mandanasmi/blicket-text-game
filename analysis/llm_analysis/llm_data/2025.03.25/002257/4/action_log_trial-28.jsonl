You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Key Findings**:\n   - When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This indicates that object 7 could potentially be a blicket as well.\n\n3. **Testing for Blickets**:\n   - After testing object 0 through object 5, we confirmed they are not blickets.\n   - When we removed object 6 from the machine, the light turned off, confirming that object 6 is indeed a blicket.\n   - When we removed object 7 from the machine, the light also turned off. This means that object 7 cannot be a blicket because the machine only turned on when object 6 was present.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light turned off when object 7 was removed, it indicates that object 7 does not have blicktness. Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
