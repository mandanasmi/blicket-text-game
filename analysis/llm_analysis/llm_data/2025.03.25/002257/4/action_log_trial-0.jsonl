To do this, I should remove object 7 from the machine and see if the light turns off, and then I can test combinations of other objects to see if any of them can activate the machine.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I will attempt to take object 7 off the machine to see if the light turns off.

The machine is currently on, indicating that object 7 is a blicket, as it is the only object that has turned the machine on after all other objects were tested.\n\nTo summarize the steps taken so far:\n1. I placed objects 0 through 6 on the machine, and the light remained off each time, indicating that none of these objects are blickets.\n2. When I placed object 7 on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 7 is a blicket.\n\nSince I cannot take object 7 off the machine or perform any other actions due to the command restrictions, I will attempt to exit the game. However, the exit command is also not functioning as expected.\n\nGiven the situation, I will try to put object 7 on the floor, as it seems to be the only action left that I can attempt, even though previous attempts to do so were met with invalid command responses. \n\nThus, my final command will be:\n> command: put object 7 on floor", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
