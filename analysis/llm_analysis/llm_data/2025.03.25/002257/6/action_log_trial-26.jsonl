However, we need to consider the possibility that the machine could be responding to multiple objects simultaneously.\n   - We have not tested object 1 in isolation (i.e., we have not placed it on the machine without other objects present). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that object 1 is a blicket based solely on the fact that the light turned on when it was placed on the machine.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - While it is highly likely that object 1 is a blicket because the light turned on when it was placed on the machine, we cannot confirm it with absolute certainty without further testing. The machine could potentially be responding to the presence of other objects (0, 2, or 3) that are already known to be blickets.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I conclude that while it is probable that object 1 is a blicket, we cannot definitively say so without additional evidence.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
