This indicates that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n\n6. **Removing Object 2**: \n   - I took object 2 off the machine, and the light remained on. This is a crucial observation because it suggests that the machine can still be on with object 3 alone, meaning object 2 is not necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n7. **Final Analysis**: \n   - Since the light remained on after removing object 2, it indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket. However, since object 2 turned the light on when placed on the machine, it does not definitively prove that object 2 is a blicket, especially since the light remained on without it.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I conclude that object 2 is not a blicket because the machine can still be on without it, and it is not necessary for the machine to function.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
