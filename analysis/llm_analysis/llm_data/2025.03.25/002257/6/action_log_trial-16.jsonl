This suggests that the objects may not be labeled as \"object 0,\" \"object 1,\" etc., but rather have different identifiers or names that I was unable to access.\n\nSince I was unable to interact with any of the objects or the machine in a meaningful way, I cannot determine if object 3 is a blicket or not. The machine did not respond to any of my attempts to put objects on it, and the light remained off throughout the entire session. \n\nGiven that I have no evidence or information to suggest that object 3 is a blicket, I conclude that I cannot affirmatively say that it is.
