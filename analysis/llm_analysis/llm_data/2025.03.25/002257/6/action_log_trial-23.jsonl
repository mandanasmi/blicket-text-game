The light remained on. This suggests that object 1 is not necessary for the machine to be on, or that there is another object contributing to the machine being on.\n\n3. **Second Action**: I took object 3 off the machine. The light turned off. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket, as its removal caused the machine to turn off.\n\n4. **Third Action**: I put object 0 on the machine. The light remained off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Fourth Action**: I put object 2 on the machine. The light remained off. This suggests that object 2 is also not a blicket.\n\n6. **Fifth Action**: I put object 1 back on the machine. The light turned on again. This indicates that object 1 is also a blicket, as its presence turned the machine back on.\n\nFrom the above interactions, we can conclude:\n- Object 3 is a blicket (since removing it turned the machine off).\n- Object 1 is a blicket (since putting it back on turned the machine on).\n- Objects 0 and 2 are not blickets (since neither turned the machine on when placed on it).\n\nNow, we need to infer the rule for how the machine turns on. The machine seems to turn on when at least one of the blickets (object 1 or object 3) is present on the machine.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Blickets**: Object 1, Object 3\n- **Rule**: The machine turns on if at least one blicket is present on it.\n\nNow, I will proceed to take action based on this understanding. Since I have identified the blickets and the rule, I will exit the game.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
