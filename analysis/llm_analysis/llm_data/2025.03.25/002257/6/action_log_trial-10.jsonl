The other objects (2 and 3) also turned the machine on when tested, but they were not tested in isolation before being removed.\n   - Since object 1 was the first object to turn the machine on and it turned off when removed, it confirms that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 1 is a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
