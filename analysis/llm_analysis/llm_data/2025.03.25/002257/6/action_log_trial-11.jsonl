This suggests that the machine is already in an \"on\" state, regardless of the objects present.\n\nGiven that the light is consistently on, it is possible that the machine has a default state that is independent of the objects. This could mean that the machine is designed to turn on automatically, or that there is a specific condition that I have not yet discovered.\n\nTo explore this further, I will try to remove the object that is currently on the machine (object 1) to see if the machine's state changes.
