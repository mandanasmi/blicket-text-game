This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This suggests that object 1 could be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on again, indicating that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on as well, suggesting that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**:\n   - After placing object 1 on the machine, I took it off, and the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is not a blicket because if it were, the light would remain on when it was removed.\n   - The same was true for objects 2 and 3; when they were removed, the light turned off, indicating they are not blickets either.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light turned off when object 1 was removed from the machine, it confirms that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the evidence gathered, I conclude that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
