This reinforces the idea that object 3 is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\n4. **Re-testing Object 3**: \n   - Placing object 3 back on the machine again resulted in the light turning on. This consistent behavior indicates that object 3 is indeed responsible for activating the machine.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since object 3 is the only object that consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, and the other objects do not activate the machine at all, we can conclude that object 3 must be a blicket. \n\nThus, based on the evidence gathered, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
