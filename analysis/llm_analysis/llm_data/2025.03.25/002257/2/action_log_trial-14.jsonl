Based on the evidence, it seems that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since object 1 is the only object that activated the machine, it appears that the rule is that the machine turns on when a blicket is present.\n\nNext, I will exit the game since I have identified the blicket (object 1) and inferred the rule for the machine.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
