Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine whether object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine based on the actions taken and the resulting states of the machine.\n\n1. **Initial Observations**: \n   - The machine is off when no objects are placed on it.\n   - When object 0 and object 1 are placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests that neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Object 2**: \n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket, as it causes the machine to activate.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3**: \n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on. This suggests that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n\n4. **Removing Objects**: \n   - When object 2 is removed from the machine, the light turns off. This confirms that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed from the machine, the light also turns off. This indicates that the machine does not remain on without object 2 or object 3, suggesting that both objects are contributing to the machine's activation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since object 3 caused the machine to turn on when it was placed on the machine and the machine turned off when it was removed, it indicates that object 3 has a relationship with the machine similar to that of object 2. Therefore, object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
