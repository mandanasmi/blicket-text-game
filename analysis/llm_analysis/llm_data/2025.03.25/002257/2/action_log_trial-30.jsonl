Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine whether object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine based on the actions taken and the resulting states of the machine.\n\n1. **Initial Observations**: \n   - When objects 0, 1, and 2 were placed on the machine individually, the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets, as they did not activate the machine.\n\n2. **Testing Object 3**:\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 3 has some property (blicktness) that causes the machine to activate.\n   - When object 3 was removed from the machine, the light turned off again. This further supports the idea that object 3 is responsible for turning the machine on.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 3 is the only object that consistently activates the machine when placed on it, and the other objects do not activate the machine at all, we can conclude that object 3 must be a blicket. \n\nThus, based on the evidence gathered, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room.
