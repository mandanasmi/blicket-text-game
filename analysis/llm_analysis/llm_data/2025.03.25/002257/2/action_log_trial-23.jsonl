However, I was unable to interact with object 3 or any other object successfully, as all attempts to put objects on the machine resulted in the same message indicating that the objects were not recognized.\n\n2. **Repeated Observations**: I repeatedly looked at the room and confirmed the same state: the machine was off, and the objects were unchanged. This suggests that there is no observable effect of the objects on the machine's state.\n\n3. **Blicket Definition**: A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine. Since the machine has not turned on at all, it indicates that none of the objects, including object 2, have any effect on the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the machine did not respond to any of the objects, including object 2, I conclude that object 2 cannot be a blicket.
