When I removed object 1, the light turned off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - After placing object 2 on the machine, the light is on. When I removed object 2, the light turned off. This indicates that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - When I placed object 3 on the machine, the light turned on. However, I did not test object 3 alone to see if it would turn the light on by itself.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both object 1 and object 2 are confirmed to be blickets (as they independently turned the machine on), and object 3 also turned the machine on when placed, it suggests that object 3 could also be a blicket. However, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket without further testing it alone.\n\nGiven that we have not tested object 3 independently, we cannot confirm its status as a blicket. Therefore, the answer to whether object 3 is a blicket is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
