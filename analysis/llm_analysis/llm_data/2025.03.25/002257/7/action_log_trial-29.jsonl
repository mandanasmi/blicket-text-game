Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine whether object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the interactions with the machine and the objects:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Object 0 is on the machine, and the light is off.\n   - Objects 1, 2, and 3 are on the floor.\n\n2. **First Action**: \n   - I took object 0 off the machine, and the light remained off. This indicates that object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Second Action**: \n   - I put object 1 on the machine, and the light remained off. This indicates that object 1 is also not a blicket.\n\n4. **Third Action**: \n   - I put object 2 on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Fourth Action**: \n   - I put object 3 on the machine, and the light remained on. This means that either object 3 is a blicket, or it is still the effect of object 2 being on the machine.\n\n6. **Fifth Action**: \n   - I took object 2 off the machine, and the light remained on. This indicates that object 3 must be a blicket because the light did not turn off when object 2 was removed.\n\n7. **Sixth Action**: \n   - I took object 3 off the machine, and the light turned off. This confirms that object 3 is indeed a blicket, as its removal caused the machine to turn off.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
