The light turned on again, confirming that object 1 is a blicket.\n\nFrom the interactions, we can summarize the findings:\n- Object 0 is a blicket (light on when placed on the machine).\n- Object 1 is a blicket (light on when placed on the machine).\n- Object 2 is not a blicket (light off when placed on the machine).\n- Object 3 is not a blicket (light off when placed on the machine).\n\nNow, I need to determine the rule for the machine turning on. The rule seems to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since both object 0 and object 1 turned the machine on, and object 2 and object 3 did not, I can conclude that the machine activates with the presence of at least one blicket.\n\nNow, I will put object 0 back on the machine to confirm its status as a blicket.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
