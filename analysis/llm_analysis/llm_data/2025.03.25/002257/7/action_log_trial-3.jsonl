This indicates that object 0 is not necessary for the machine to stay on, suggesting that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n5. **Fourth Action**: I put object 2 on the machine, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n6. **Fifth Action**: I put object 3 on the machine, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom these interactions, we can infer that:\n- The machine turns on with any of the objects (0, 1, 2, or 3) placed on it.\n- Since the light remained on when I removed object 0, it confirms that at least one of the other objects (1, 2, or 3) is a blicket.\n\nNow, since all objects have been tested and the machine has turned on with each of them, it seems that all four objects (0, 1, 2, and 3) are blickets.\n\nNext, I need to summarize the rule for how the machine turns on. The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since all objects have been shown to activate the machine, I can conclude that the rule is that the machine turns on with any of the blickets.\n\nNow, I will finalize my command to exit the game, as I have identified all the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
