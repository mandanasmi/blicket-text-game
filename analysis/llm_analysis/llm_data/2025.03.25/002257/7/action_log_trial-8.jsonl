This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When I took object 0 off, the light turned off, confirming that it was indeed the presence of object 0 that activated the machine.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - I then put object 1 on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - Next, I put object 2 on the machine, and the light turned on again, indicating that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - I then put object 3 on the machine, and the light turned on as well, suggesting that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\n4. **Removing Objects**:\n   - I took object 3 off the machine, and the light remained on. This indicates that object 3 is not necessary for the machine to stay on, which suggests that at least one of the other objects (0, 1, or 2) is sufficient to keep the machine activated.\n   - I took object 1 off the machine, and the light turned off, indicating that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n   - I took object 2 off the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - I took object 0 off the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that object 0 is a blicket as well.\n\n5. **Final Analysis**:\n   - All four objects (0, 1, 2, and 3) have been shown to activate the machine when placed on it. However, the removal of object 1 and object 2 confirmed their status as blickets since the machine turned off when they were removed.\n   - Object 3's removal did not affect the machine's state when other objects were present, suggesting that it may not be a blicket or that it is not necessary for the machine to be on.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that objects 0, 1, and 2 are definitely blickets. Object 3's status is uncertain, but it seems less likely to be a blicket since it did not affect the machine's state when other blickets were present.\n\nNow, I will put object 3 on the machine to see if it activates the machine on its own.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
