However, since all other objects (0, 1, and 2) were confirmed not to be blickets, it strongly suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the process of elimination and the behavior of the machine, we can conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
