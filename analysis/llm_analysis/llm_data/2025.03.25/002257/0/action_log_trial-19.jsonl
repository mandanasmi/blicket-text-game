You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 3**: Placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n\n3. **Further Testing**:\n   - After removing object 2 from the machine, the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine again resulted in the light being off, which suggests that object 3 does not activate the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both objects 0 and 1 did not activate the machine when placed on it, and object 3 also did not activate the machine, we can conclude that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nThus, based on the evidence gathered, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
