This indicates that none of these objects (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are blickets.\n   - When I placed object 6 on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - When I placed object 7 on the machine, the light also turned on.

Since both object 6 and object 7 turned the machine on, and removing either one still allowed the machine to stay on, it suggests that the machine requires at least one blicket to be present to activate.\n\nNow, I will summarize my findings:\n- **Blickets**: Object 6 and Object 7\n- **Rule**: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it.\n\nSince I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule, I will exit the game.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
