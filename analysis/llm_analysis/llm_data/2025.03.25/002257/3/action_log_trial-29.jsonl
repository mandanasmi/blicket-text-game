All attempts to put objects on the machine or take object 2 off have resulted in the same message: \"is not a recognized object.\" This suggests that there may be a problem with how I am identifying or interacting with the objects.\n\nSince I have not been able to make any progress in identifying the blickets or the rule for the machine, I will try to interact with the machine in a different way. I will attempt to take object 2 off the machine again, as it is the only object that is currently on the machine, and I need to see if I can interact with it in a different way.\n\n> take 2 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
