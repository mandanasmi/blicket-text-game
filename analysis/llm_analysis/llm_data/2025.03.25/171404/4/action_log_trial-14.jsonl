This suggests that objects may have different \"blicktness\" levels, and the machine stays on as long as the total blicktness meets some threshold.\n\nKey insight: The machine seems to stay on as long as at least one blicket is on it. Since removing object 1 turned it off while others didn't, object 1 is likely the only true blicket. The other objects may trigger the machine when placed alone due to some initial activation, but don't sustain it in combinations.\n\nTo confirm, I should test combinations where only object 1 is on the machine versus others.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Multiple object interactions:\n- When object 0 and 1 are both on the machine, removing 0 keeps it on, but removing 1 turns it off\n- When object 1 and 2 are on, removing 1 turns it off\n- When object 1 and 3 are on, removing 1 turns it off\n- Object 3 alone doesn't keep the machine on (when placed alone after removing others)\n\n3. Key pattern:\n- Object 1 seems essential - whenever it's removed, machine turns off\n- Other objects can be removed while keeping machine on if object 1 remains\n- Object 3 might not be a blicket (since placing it alone didn't turn machine on)\n\nConclusion:\n- Blickets: objects 0, 1, 2\n- Rule: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it.
