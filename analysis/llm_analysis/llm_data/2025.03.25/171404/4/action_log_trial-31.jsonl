You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initial state: object 2 was on the machine (light ON). When removed, light turned OFF.\n2. Putting object 0 alone on machine: light OFF\n3. Putting object 1 alone on machine: light ON\n4. Putting object 3 alone on machine: light ON\n5. Putting object 2 alone on machine: light ON\n6. When only object 0 is on machine: light OFF\n7. When object 1 is removed (only object 0 remains): light OFF\n8. When object 2 is added (objects 0+2): light ON\n\nKey findings:\n- Objects 1, 2, and 3 each independently turn the machine ON when placed alone\n- Object 0 does not turn the machine ON when placed alone\n- The machine seems to activate when at least one blicket is present\n\nSince object 3 turned the machine ON when placed alone (just like objects 1 and 2), it must be a blicket.
