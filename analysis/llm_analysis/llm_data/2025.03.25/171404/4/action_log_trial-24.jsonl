This suggests the machine turns on when ANY blicket is present (OR rule), not requiring all blickets.\n\n3. However, since all single objects turn the machine on, this would imply all are blickets. Alternatively, there might be a different rule where the machine turns on when any object is placed (regardless of blicktness), but this contradicts the typical blicket paradigm.\n\nGiven this confusion, I should test if the machine can be on with no objects (maybe it's always on), and verify if any object fails to turn it on individually.\n\n> take object 0 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
