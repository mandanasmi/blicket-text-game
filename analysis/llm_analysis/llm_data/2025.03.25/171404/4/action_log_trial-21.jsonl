When object 0, 1, 2, or 3 are placed on the machine individually, the machine turns on. This suggests each object might be a blicket (since any single object activates the machine).\n\n2. However, when we remove objects sequentially:\n   - Removing object 0 keeps the machine on (still objects 1,2,3 on machine)\n   - Removing object 1 turns the machine off (only objects 2,3 remain)\n   - Later, we see that with only object 0 on the machine, it stays on\n   - With only object 1 on the machine, it stays on\n   - With objects 0 and 3 on the machine, it stays on\n   - With objects 1 and 3 on the machine, it stays on\n\nThe key observation is that the machine turns off only when object 1 is removed (when it was the last remaining object on the machine in one test). This suggests object 1 is essential for the machine to stay on, while other objects may not be. However, object 2 never independently keeps the machine on when it's the only object on the machine (we haven't tested this configuration directly, but when objects 2 and 3 were on and we removed 2, the machine stayed on, suggesting 3 can keep it on).\n\nGiven that the machine turns on when object 2 is placed on it (even if other objects are present), and we don't have evidence that it fails to activate the machine when alone, we should conclude it is a blicket.

When object 3 is placed on the machine alone (after taking all others off), the machine turns on (observed in steps: put 3 on with others off \u2192 light on).\n2. The machine also stays on when object 3 is removed in certain configurations where other blickets remain (e.g., when 0 and 3 are on, removing 3 keeps light on because 0 is likely a blicket).\n3.
