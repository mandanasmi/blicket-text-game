Initial tests showed that any single object turns the machine on when placed alone.\n2. However, when all objects were removed, the machine turned off, suggesting at least one object must be on the machine to activate it.\n3. Later tests revealed more nuanced behavior:\n   - With object 3 alone, machine is on\n   - With object 0 alone, machine is on\n   - But objects 1 and 2 together don't activate the machine\n   - Adding object 0 or 3 to objects 1 and 2 activates the machine\n\nThis suggests that:\n- Objects 0 and 3 are blickets (they can activate the machine alone or in combination)\n- Objects 1 and 2 are not blickets (they don't activate the machine alone or together)\n- The rule appears to be: The machine activates if at least one blicket is on it\n\nFinal test to confirm:\n> put object 1 on machine\n\nThis should keep the machine off if my hypothesis is correct, since object 1 is not a blicket.", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
