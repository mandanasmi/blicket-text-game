This suggests object 2 is necessary to keep the machine on when it's the last object remaining.\n   - However, the machine stayed on when objects 0 and 1 were removed, implying the machine might require at least one object to be on it to stay on, but not necessarily a specific one.\n\n2. Hypothesis:\n   - The machine turns on if at least one object is on it (simple \"OR\" rule). All objects might be blickets, or the rule doesn't depend on blicketness at all.\n   - Alternatively, object 2 might be the only blicket, and the machine turns on when any object is placed on it but stays on only if the blicket (object 2) is present.\n\n3. Next steps:\n   - Test if the machine turns on with object 2 alone (already confirmed when objects 0 and 1 were removed).\n   - Test if the machine turns on with other single objects to confirm whether all objects are blickets or only object 2.\n\n**Command:**\n> put object 3 on the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
