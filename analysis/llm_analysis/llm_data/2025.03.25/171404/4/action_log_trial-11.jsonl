Initial tests showed that any single object turns the machine on when placed alone.\n2. However, when all objects were removed, the machine turned off, suggesting at least one object must be on the machine for it to stay on.\n3. More interestingly, when only object 0 was on the machine, removing it turned the machine off, even when other objects were present (e.g., steps where object 1 was on but removing 0 turned it off).\n4. This suggests object 0 is special - the machine only stays on if object 0 is present. Other objects don't seem to affect the machine's state when removed as long as object 0 remains.\n\nFrom this, I can conclude:\n- Object 0 is likely the only blicket\n- The rule is: The machine turns on if and only if object 0 is on it\n\nTo confirm this, I'll test removing object 0 while keeping other objects on the machine.\n\n> take object 0 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
