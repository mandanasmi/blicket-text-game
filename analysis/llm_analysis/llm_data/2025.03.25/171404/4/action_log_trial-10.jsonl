This suggests that the machine turns on if *at least one object is on it*. However, this doesn't help identify which objects are blickets, since all objects seem to behave the same way. \n\nTo identify blickets, I need to test combinations of objects to see if the machine behaves differently (e.g., turns on only when specific objects are present). Since all objects individually turn the machine on, I should test pairs or groups to see if the rule is more nuanced (e.g., \"only object X and Y together turn it on\"). \n\nNext step: Test a pair of objects to see if the machine behaves differently (e.g., turns off when one is removed). \n\n> put object 0 and object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Key observation: When object 0 and object 1 were both on the machine, removing object 0 kept the machine on, but removing object 1 turned it off. This suggests object 1 is necessary to keep the machine on in this configuration.\n4. Later, with object 0 and object 2 on, removing object 1 (which wasn't even on the machine) turned the machine off - this seems inconsistent and might indicate a misinterpretation.\n5. Most consistent pattern: The machine seems to require at least one blicket to be on it to stay active. When only non-blickets are on, it turns off.\n\nFrom the data, it appears:\n- Object 3 is definitely a blicket (when it was the last one on, machine stayed on)\n- Object 1 seems to be a blicket (when it was removed with object 0 present, machine turned off)\n- Objects 0 and 2's status is less clear, but likely not blickets\n\nThe rule appears to be: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it, and stays on as long as at least one blicket remains on it.\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 3 more definitively by putting it on alone.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
