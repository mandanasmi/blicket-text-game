Later, adding object 2 alone turned the light on again.\n\nThis suggests that object 2 is necessary to turn the machine on, but not sufficient by itself (since it was initially on the machine alone and the light was off). The light seems to turn on when object 2 is present along with at least one other object (either 0, 1, or 3). However, since the light turned on when only object 2 was added to the machine (with 0 and 1 already on), and turned off when object 1 was removed (leaving 2 and 3 on), it indicates that object 2's presence is directly correlated with the machine's state when combined with other objects. \n\nThus, object 2 is a blicket because its state (being on the machine) affects the machine's state (light on/off) in combination with other objects.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
