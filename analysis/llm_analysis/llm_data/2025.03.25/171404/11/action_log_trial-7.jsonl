When object 2 is placed on the machine alone, the machine turns on (steps 3, 30, 32).\n2. When object 1 is placed on the machine alone, the machine turns on (steps 6, 14).\n3. When object 0 is placed on the machine alone, the machine stays off (step 1), but turns on when placed with object 2 already on the machine (step 11).\n4. Object 3 was placed on the machine alone in step 5 and the machine stayed off. No combination with object 3 turned the machine on (steps 18-19, 24-25, 27-28).\n\nFrom this, we can see that object 3 never caused the machine to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects.
