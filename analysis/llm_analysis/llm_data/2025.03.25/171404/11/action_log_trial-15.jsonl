When object 1 was removed, the light turned off (step 14), showing object 2 alone wasn't enough.\n4. When object 3 was placed on the machine alone (step 18), the light remained off.\n5. The light only turned on when either object 1 or object 2 was present, and never seemed to depend on object 3.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 never caused the machine to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects.
