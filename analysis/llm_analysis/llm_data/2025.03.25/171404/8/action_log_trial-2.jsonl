Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let's analyze the data collected:\n\n1. The machine turns on when object 0 is placed on it alone (steps 4, 12, 21, 28).\n2. The machine does not turn on when object 7 is placed on it alone (step 20).\n3. When object 0 is on the machine, adding other objects (1, 2, 4) keeps the machine on (steps 5, 7, 9, 10, 22).\n4. When object 0 is removed, the machine turns off regardless of other objects (steps 6, 13, 15, 24, 26).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 0 is the only blicket - it's the only object that affects the machine's state. Object 7 never caused the machine to turn on, nor did it affect the machine's state when combined with other objects.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
