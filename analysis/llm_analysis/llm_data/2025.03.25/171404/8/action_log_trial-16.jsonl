You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

The machine turns on when object 5 is placed on it (alone), indicating object 5 is a blicket.\n2. The machine also turns on when object 4 is placed on it (with object 5 already present), indicating object 4 is a blicket.\n3. When objects 6 and 7 are placed on the machine (with object 5), the machine stays on, but removing them doesn't affect the machine's state (it stays on if object 4 or 5 are present, turns off otherwise).\n4. Specifically, when only objects 6 and 7 are on the machine (without 4 or 5), the machine remains off, showing they don't activate it.\n5. No evidence shows that object 7's presence or absence affects the machine's state independently.\n\nConclusion: Object 7 does not influence the machine's state, so it's not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
