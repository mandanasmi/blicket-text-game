You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

When object 7 was placed on the machine alone (after taking object 6 off), the machine did not turn on.\n2. When object 7 was on the machine with object 6, the machine was on, but this was entirely due to object 6 (as we saw earlier that object 6 alone turns the machine on).\n3. Removing object 6 while object 7 remained on the machine caused the machine to turn off, confirming object 7 has no effect.\n\nSince the machine's state is independent of object 7's presence (it doesn't turn on the machine alone or contribute to its activation), object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
