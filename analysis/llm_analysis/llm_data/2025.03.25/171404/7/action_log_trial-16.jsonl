Initial state: Only object 6 was on machine, light was off.\n2. When objects 0,1,2 were added, light remained off. Adding object 3 turned it on.\n3. Removing 0,1 kept light on, but removing 2 turned it off.\n4. Re-adding 2 turned light back on.\n5. Adding 4,5,6 didn't turn light off when 2 was present.\n6. Later tests show that having object 2 alone turns light on, and removing it turns light off regardless of other objects.\n\nKey insights:\n- Object 2 seems to be the only necessary object to turn on the machine\n- Other objects don't affect the light when 2 is present\n- When 2 is absent, no combination of other objects turns on the light\n\nConclusion:\n- Only object 2 is a blicket\n- Rule: The machine turns on if and only if object 2 is on it\n\nSince I've deduced the rule and identified the blicket, I can exit now.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
