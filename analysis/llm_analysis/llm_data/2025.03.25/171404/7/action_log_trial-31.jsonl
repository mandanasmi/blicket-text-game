When object 0 was on the machine along with other objects (5,6,7), the machine stayed on, but we don't know if those other objects are blickets because object 0 was already activating it.\n4. The machine turned off when object 0 was removed, regardless of other objects being present (like 6).\n\nSince we never saw object 6 alone or in combinations that would prove it can activate the machine without other known blickets (0 or 3), we cannot confirm it's a blicket.
