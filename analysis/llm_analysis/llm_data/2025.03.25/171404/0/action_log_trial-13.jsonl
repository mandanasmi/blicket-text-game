You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n4. Later tests showed that:\n   - Object 4 can activate the machine (when placed with object 7)\n   - Object 7 alone doesn't activate the machine (initial state)\n   - Object 7 doesn't seem necessary for activation (machine stayed on when it was removed while other blickets were present)\n   - Object 2 doesn't seem to be a blicket (initial state with object 7)\n\nThe key observations about object 7:\n- It was on the machine initially with object 2 and the light was off\n- It was present when the machine was activated by other objects (3, 4), but not necessary for activation\n- It never alone caused activation\n\nConclusion: Object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
