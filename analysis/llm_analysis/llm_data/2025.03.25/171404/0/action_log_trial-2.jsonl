Initially, only object 2 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When objects 0-5 were placed on the machine (in various combinations), the light remained off.\n3. When object 6 was added to the machine (with other objects present), the light turned on.\n4. When object 6 was removed, the light turned off.\n5. When object 7 was placed alone on the machine, the light turned on.\n6. When object 7 was removed (with object 6 still present), the light remained on.\n\nKey findings:\n- Object 6 can turn the machine on when combined with other objects, and can keep it on when object 7 is removed.\n- Object 7 alone can turn the machine on, suggesting it's a blicket.\n- The machine seems to activate when at least one blicket is present (object 6 or 7).\n\nSince the machine turned on when object 7 was placed alone on it, this indicates object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
