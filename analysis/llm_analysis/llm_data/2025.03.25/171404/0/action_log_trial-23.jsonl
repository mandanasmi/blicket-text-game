Initial tests showed that putting any single object on the machine turns it on, which was confusing.\n2.

Subsequent tests show that the machine stays on as long as at least one of objects 4, 5, or 6 is on it, regardless of other objects.\n4. When only objects 0-3 or 7 are on the machine, it doesn't stay on (as seen when removing 4/5/6 caused it to turn off).\n\nConclusion: \n- Blickets are objects 4, 5, and 6 (the machine requires at least one of them to be present to stay on)\n- The rule is: The machine turns on if at least one blicket (object 4, 5, or 6) is on it.

Initially, putting any single object on the machine turns it on, which suggests that any object alone can activate the machine (but this might not be the full rule).\n2. When we remove objects 4, 5, and 6, the machine turns off, suggesting these are critical for activation.\n3. Later experiments show that object 4 seems particularly important - when it's removed, the machine turns off even if other objects are present.\n4. Object 7 was never the last object removed when the machine turned off, and the machine stayed on when it was present with other objects.\n5. The machine stayed on when object 7 was the only object on it (during initial tests), but this might have been because any single object activates it in that configuration.\n\nHowever, the key observation is that object 7 was never shown to be necessary to keep the machine on - the machine stayed on when object 7 was removed as long as other objects (like 4) were present.
