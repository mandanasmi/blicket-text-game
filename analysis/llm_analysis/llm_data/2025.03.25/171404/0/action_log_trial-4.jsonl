Initially, object 3 was on the machine, and the light was off (since no other objects were on it).\n2. When object 3 was placed back on the machine with other objects (1, 2, etc.), the light remained on, but this doesn't tell us if 3 is a blicket because other objects could be activating it.\n3. When object 3 was the only object on the machine (after taking others off), the light was off (implied by the state after taking object 1 off while 3 was still on).\n4. The light only turned on when object 1 or 7 was present, regardless of object 3's presence.\n\nConclusion: Object 3 does not independently activate the machine, and its presence doesn't correlate with the machine turning on.
