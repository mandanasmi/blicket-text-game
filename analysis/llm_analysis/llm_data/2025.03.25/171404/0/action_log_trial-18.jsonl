When any single object (0-7) is placed on the machine alone, the machine turns on. This suggests that every object individually can activate the machine.\n2. When object 0 is removed while other objects remain on the machine, the machine stays on (e.g., when object 5 was removed while object 0 remained, the machine stayed on).\n3. The only time the machine turns off is when object 0 is the last object removed (e.g., when object 0 was removed while no other objects were on the machine, it turned off).\n\nThis suggests that object 0 is special - it's the only object that seems necessary to keep the machine on. All other objects (1-7) can activate the machine when placed alone, but don't seem to be required to keep it on when multiple objects are present. \n\nHowever, since the machine turns on when any single object is placed on it (including object 7), this suggests all objects are blickets by the simplest definition (they can activate the machine).
