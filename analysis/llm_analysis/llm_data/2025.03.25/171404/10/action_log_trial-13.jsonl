You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, putting objects 0 and 1 on the machine didn't turn it on.\n2. When object 2 was added (with 0 and 1 already on), the machine turned on.\n3. Removing object 0 kept the machine on (so object 0 isn't necessary).\n4. Adding object 3 (with 1 and 2 already on) kept the machine on.\n5. When only object 2 was on the machine, it turned on.\n6. When only object 3 was on the machine, it stayed off.\n7. The machine only turns on when object 2 is present.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 2 is the only blicket in this scenario.
