Later, with only object 2 on machine \u2192 light stays off\n4. Object 0 + object 2 \u2192 light turns on\n5. Object 2 alone \u2192 light off\n\nThe key pattern is that the light only turns on when both object 0 and object 2 are on the machine together. This suggests that both object 0 and object 2 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are placed on it (or specifically these two blickets together).\n\nSince the light turns on in combinations involving object 2 (with object 0), but not when object 2 is alone, object 2 must be a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
