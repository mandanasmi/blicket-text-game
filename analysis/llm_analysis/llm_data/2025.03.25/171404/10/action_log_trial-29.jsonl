Initial tests showed that putting objects 0,1,2 individually didn't turn on the machine, but adding object 3 did.\n2. When objects 1 and 3 were on the machine together, the light stayed on.\n3. Removing object 1 turned the light off, suggesting object 1 is necessary.\n4. Later tests show that with objects 1 and 3 together, the light stays on regardless of other objects.\n\nKey insights:\n- Object 3 alone can turn on the machine (seen in first test)\n- Object 1 seems to be required in combination with object 3\n- Objects 0 and 2 don't seem to affect the machine's state\n\nHypothesis:\n- The rule might be \"the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, but object 1 is special - it needs to be combined with another blicket\"\n- Likely blickets: object 1 and object 3\n- Non-blickets: objects 0 and 2\n\nTo confirm, I should test putting object 1 alone on the machine (which we've seen doesn't turn it on), and object 3 alone (which we've seen does turn it on).\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
