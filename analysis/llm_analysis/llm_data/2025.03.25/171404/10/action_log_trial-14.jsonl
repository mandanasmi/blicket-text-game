When object 2 is added alone, light turns on.\n5. When object 3 is added alone, light turns on.\n6. When trying combinations (which failed due to syntax), the light sometimes stayed on or off, but the syntax errors make these observations unreliable.\n7. Most importantly, every time a single object (1, 2, or 3) was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on, while object 0 alone never turned it on.\n\nThis suggests objects 1, 2, and 3 are blickets (they can activate the machine individually), while object 0 is not.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
