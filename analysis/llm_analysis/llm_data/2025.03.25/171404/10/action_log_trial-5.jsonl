Initially, putting objects 0 and 1 on the machine didn't turn it on.\n2. When object 2 was added (with 0 and 1 already on), the machine turned on.\n3. Removing object 0 kept the machine on (so object 0 isn't necessary).\n4. Adding object 3 didn't change the state (machine stayed on).\n5. When we removed both 1 and 2, the machine turned off.\n6. Later, putting just 2 on didn't turn it on, but adding 1 made it turn on again.\n\nKey findings:\n- The machine turns on when both object 1 and object 2 are present together.\n- Object 3's presence or absence doesn't affect the machine's state.\n- Object 0's presence or absence doesn't affect the machine's state.\n\nConclusion: Object 3 is not a blicket because its presence doesn't contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
