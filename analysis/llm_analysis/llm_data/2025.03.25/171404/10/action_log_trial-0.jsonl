Hypothesis:\n   - Object 3 is likely a blicket, as it alone can activate the machine.\n   - Objects 0, 1, and 2 are likely not blickets, as they did not activate the machine individually or in combination without object 3.\n   - The rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is placed on it. Since only object 3 seems to have this property, the rule is likely \"machine turns on if object 3 is on it.\"\n\n3. Next steps:\n   - Confirm that objects 0, 1, and 2 are not blickets by testing combinations with object 3 to see if the machine still turns on (implying object 3 is the sole blicket).\n   - Alternatively, test if the machine turns on with any other combination excluding object 3.\n\n**Command:**\n> put object 0 and object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

When object 0 was put on alone, it didn't turn the machine on, but when added to object 3, the machine stayed on.\n\nFrom this, I can hypothesize:\n- Object 3 is definitely a blicket (turns machine on by itself)\n- Object 0 might be a blicket that only activates when combined with object 3 (or needs another blicket)\n- Objects 1 and 2 seem inactive (don't turn machine on alone or in combinations tested)\n\nTo confirm, I should test if object 0 can turn the machine on when combined with other objects besides object 3.\n\n> put object 0 and object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
