You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, only object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When all objects (0,1,2,3) were placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n3. When object 0 was removed (leaving 1,2,3), the light remained on.\n4. When object 1 was removed (leaving 2,3), the light turned off.\n5. When object 1 was placed back (1,2,3), the light turned on again.\n6. Object 3 alone never turned the machine on (when only 3 was on the machine, light was off).\n\nKey findings:\n- The machine turns on when object 1 is present (regardless of other objects).\n- Object 3's presence doesn't independently turn on the machine.\n- The machine doesn't require all objects to be present to turn on.\n\nConclusion: Object 3 is not a blicket because its presence alone doesn't turn on the machine, and the machine's activation depends on object 1.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
