The machine only turns on when object 3 is placed on it, regardless of the presence of other objects (e.g., placing object 0 alone does not turn it on, but placing object 3 alone does).\n2. When object 3 is removed, the machine turns off, even if other objects remain on it.\n3. The presence of other objects (0, 1, 2) does not independently activate the machine, nor do they affect the activation when object 3 is present.\n\nThis strongly suggests that object 3 is the only blicket in this scenario, as it is the sole object whose presence reliably activates the machine.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
