Initial tests:\n- Only object 1 on machine \u2192 light on\n- Objects 0+1 on machine \u2192 light on\n- Remove object 0 \u2192 light off (suggests object 1 alone can activate)\n- But later, object 1 alone doesn't activate (contradiction)\n- Objects 0+2 \u2192 light on\n- Objects 0+1+2+3 \u2192 light on\n- Remove object 1 \u2192 light off (but 0+2+3 remain)\n\n2. Emerging pattern:\n- The machine seems to require at least two specific objects to activate\n- Object 1 appears important, but not sufficient alone\n- Object 0 seems to activate when paired with others\n- Possible blickets: objects that can contribute to activation in combination\n\n3. Key insight:\nThe rule appears to be that the machine activates when at least two blickets are placed on it simultaneously. The blickets seem to be objects 0 and 1, since:\n- 0+1 activates\n- 0+2 activates (but 2 alone doesn't, suggesting 0 is blicket)\n- 1 alone sometimes activates (possibly inconsistent observation)\n- Other combinations with 3 seem to require presence of 0 or 1\n\nFinal conclusion: Blickets are objects 0 and 1, and the rule is that the machine activates when two or more blickets are placed on it.\n\nSince I've deduced the likely rule and blickets, I'll exit the game.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

When object 1 was removed (objects 0+2+3), the light stayed on.\n8. When object 1 was added back (objects 0+1+2+3), the light stayed on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can see that the machine turns on when both object 0 and object 1 are present together, or when object 0 is present with other objects. The presence of object 2 never seems to be necessary for the machine to turn on, as the light stays on whether it's present or not (as seen in steps 7-8 where object 2 is present but the light state depends on other objects).\n\nTherefore, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
