Initially, object 1 was on the machine and the light was off. When we put object 0 on (with object 1 already there), the light turned on. Then removing object 1 turned it off, suggesting object 0 alone doesn't activate the machine.\n2. Putting object 1 back on alone turned the machine on, suggesting object 1 is a blicket.\n3. Similarly, object 2 and object 3 each turned the machine on when placed alone.\n4. However, when object 0 was placed alone, the machine didn't turn on (after taking object 1 off).\n5. The machine seems to turn on when any blicket is placed on it, regardless of other objects.\n\nFrom this, objects 1, 2, and 3 each independently activate the machine, while object 0 does not.
