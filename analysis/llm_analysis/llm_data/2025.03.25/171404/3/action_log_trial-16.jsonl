When any single object (0, 1, 2, or 3) is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that any single object can activate the machine, but doesn't necessarily mean all are blickets (since the rule could be more complex, like \"at least one object\").\n2. When all objects (0, 1, 2, 3) are on the machine, the light is on. When all are removed, the light turns off. This is consistent with the initial observations.\n3. The critical test is when objects 0 and 1 are on the machine (after removing 2 and 3), and the light remains on. This suggests that objects 0 and 1 are sufficient to keep the light on, even without 2 and 3. However, since the light also turns on with any single object, this doesn't rule out any objects yet.\n4. The most telling observation is that when only object 3 is removed (after having all objects on the machine), the light stays on. But when object 3 is the last one removed (after 0, 1, and 2 are already off), the light turns off. This implies that object 3 is necessary to keep the light on when it's the only object on the machine, but not when others are present. This suggests object 3 is a blicket, as it can activate the machine alone.\n\nHowever, the initial observations show that any single object can activate the machine, which contradicts the idea that only some are blickets. Given that, the most plausible rule is that all objects are blickets (since any single one can activate the machine), and the light turns off only when no objects are on the machine. \n\nBut the question specifically asks about object 3.
