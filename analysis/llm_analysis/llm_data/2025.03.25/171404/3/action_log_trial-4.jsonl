However, when object 3 was removed while object 0 remained, light stayed ON \u2192 suggests object 0 is also a blicket.\n5. Similar pattern with object 1 - putting it alone turned light ON \u2192 suggests it's a blicket.\n6. Object 2 alone also turned light ON \u2192 suggests it's a blicket.\n7. But when multiple objects were on machine, light stayed ON until all were removed.\n\nThis suggests either:\n- All objects are blickets (each can activate machine alone), or\n- The rule is \"machine turns ON when any object is placed on it\"\n\nGiven that the initial state had only object 3 on machine and light was ON, and removing it turned light OFF, it seems all objects can independently activate the machine. Therefore, all objects are likely blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns ON when any blicket is placed on it (since all objects seem to be blickets).\n\nTo confirm, I should test if the machine turns ON with any single object.\n\n> put object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
