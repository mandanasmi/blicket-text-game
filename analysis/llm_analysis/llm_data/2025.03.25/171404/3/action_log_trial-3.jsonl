Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let me analyze the observations:\n\n1. Initially, all objects were on the floor and the machine was off.\n2. When any single object was placed on the machine, the light turned on (objects 0, 1, 2, 3).\n3. However, when object 1 was removed while others remained, the machine turned off, suggesting object 1 is crucial.\n4. Other objects (0, 2, 3) didn't seem to keep the machine on when placed alone or removed.\n5. Object 3 was only tested once when all objects were placed together, so its individual effect isn't clear.\n6. The consistent pattern is that only object 1 seems to activate the machine when placed alone.\n\nSince object 3 didn't demonstrate any ability to activate the machine by itself (only when placed with other objects), and object 1 seems to be the only true blicket, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
