When only object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket by itself.\n5. When object 0 was placed with object 3, the light remained off, but when object 1 was added (with objects 0 and 3), the light turned on. This further confirms object 1 is a blicket and object 0 is not.\n\nFrom these observations, the rule appears to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Objects 1, 2, and 3 each independently turned the machine on when placed alone, while object 0 never turned the machine on by itself or in combination with other non-blickets.\n\nSince object 2 turned the machine on by itself, it must be a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
