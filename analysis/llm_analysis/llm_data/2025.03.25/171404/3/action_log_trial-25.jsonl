Initially, putting object 0 alone didn't turn on the machine.\n2. When object 1 was added (with object 0), the machine turned on.\n3. Removing object 0 kept the machine on (so object 1 alone can keep it on).\n4. Later tests showed that putting object 1 on the machine alone consistently turns it on (steps 15 and 26).\n5. The machine turns off when only object 3 is on it (steps 10-11, 21-23), and when only object 2 is on it (steps 18-19).\n\nThe consistent pattern is that the machine turns on when object 1 is present, regardless of other objects.
