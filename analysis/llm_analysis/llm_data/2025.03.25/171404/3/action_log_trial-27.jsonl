You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Initial state: object 1 is on machine, light is on. When we remove object 1, light turns off. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n2. Putting object 0 on machine doesn't turn on light (not a blicket).\n3. Putting object 1 or 2 on machine turns on light (both seem to be blickets).\n4. When object 3 is alone on machine, light stays off (not a blicket).\n5. Light stays on when multiple objects are on machine as long as at least one blicket is present (object 1 or 2).\n\nKey observation: The machine turns on when any blicket is present, regardless of other objects.
