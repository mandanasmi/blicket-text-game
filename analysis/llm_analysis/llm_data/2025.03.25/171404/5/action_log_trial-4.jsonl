Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When only object 0 was on the machine, the light stayed off.\n2. When object 1 was added, the light turned on. Removing object 0 while keeping object 1 kept the light on, showing object 1 alone can activate the machine.\n3. Object 2 was shown to activate the machine when placed alone (after removing object 1).\n4. Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times (with other objects and alone), but the light only turned on when other objects (1 or 2) were present. When only object 3 was on the machine, the light stayed off.\n\nConclusion: Object 3 never independently caused the machine to turn on, and its presence didn't affect the machine's state when other blickets were present or absent.
