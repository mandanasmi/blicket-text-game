When object 3 is placed on the machine alone (with object 1 already on it), the machine turns on (step 8).\n2. When object 3 is removed (with object 1 remaining), the machine turns off (step 12).\n3. When object 3 is placed back (with object 1 remaining), the machine turns on again (step 14).\n4. When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2 (step 17), the machine stays off, but this is likely because object 2 is not a blicket (as seen in step 6 where object 2 alone doesn't turn on the machine).\n5. Later interactions show that object 3 consistently turns the machine on when placed with other objects (steps 22, 24).\n\nThe machine's state depends on whether object 3 is present, indicating it has blicktness. The mutual information between object 3's state and the machine's state is nonzero.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
