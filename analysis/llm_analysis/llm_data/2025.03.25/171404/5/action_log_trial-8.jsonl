Removing object 0 kept the machine on.\n4. Adding object 3 kept the machine on.\n5. When only objects 2 and 3 were on, machine stayed on.\n6. When both 2 and 3 were removed, machine turned off.\n7. Later, object 3 alone turned the machine on.\n8. Adding non-blickets (0 and 1) didn't affect the state when a blicket was present.\n\nFrom this, it appears:\n- Object 2 and object 3 are likely blickets (each can activate the machine alone)\n- Objects 0 and 1 are not blickets (they never caused activation)\n- The rule seems to be \"OR\" - the machine turns on if any blicket is present\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 3 alone again since the last test had object 0 already on the machine (which might confuse the results).\n\n> take object 0 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let's analyze the interactions to determine if object 3 is a blicket:\n\n1. When objects 0, 1, and 2 were on the machine, the light turned on. When object 2 was removed, the light stayed on (with objects 0 and 1 remaining), suggesting object 2 might be a blicket.\n2. When object 3 was added to the machine (with objects 1 and 2), the light stayed on. When object 3 was later removed (with object 2 remaining), the light stayed on, but when object 2 was then removed, the light turned off. This suggests object 2 is critical.\n3. In another test, object 3 alone turned the machine on (when placed on the machine by itself).\n4. When object 3 was on with object 0 and 1, the light stayed on even after removing 0 and 1, suggesting object 3 can independently activate the machine.\n\nThe key observation is that the machine turns on when object 3 is placed on it (alone or with others), and turns off when object 3 is removed (if no other blickets are present). This shows object 3's state directly affects the machine's state.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
