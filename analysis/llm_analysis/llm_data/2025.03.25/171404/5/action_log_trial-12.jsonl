Later when objects 0, 1, and 3 were on the machine, the light stayed on (but object 0 alone can turn it on).\n\nThere's no evidence that object 3's presence alone or in combination affects the machine's state. The light turns on with object 0 or 2 alone, and stays on when adding object 3 doesn't change the state. Therefore, object 3 is likely not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
