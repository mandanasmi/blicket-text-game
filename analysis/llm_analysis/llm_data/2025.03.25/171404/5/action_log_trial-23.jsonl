Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Key observations:\n- Machine turns ON when either object 0 or object 3 is present\n- Objects 1 and 2 never cause the machine to turn ON by themselves\n- Presence of objects 1/2 doesn't affect the machine's state when 0/3 are present\n\nFrom this, I can conclude:\n- Blickets are objects 0 and 3 (their presence affects machine state)\n- The rule appears to be: Machine turns ON if at least one of object 0 or object 3 is on it\n\nTo confirm this completely, I should test one more combination where neither 0 nor 3 is present.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
