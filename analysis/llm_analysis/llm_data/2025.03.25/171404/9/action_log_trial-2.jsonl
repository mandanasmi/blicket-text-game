Hypotheses:\n   - The machine requires all 4 objects to be on it to turn on (additive rule).\n   - Alternatively, object 0 might be a necessary blicket, and the others are irrelevant, but this contradicts the first observation where the light only turned on when all 4 were present.\n   - Another possibility is that the machine turns on when a specific combination or subset of objects is present, but the current data suggests all objects are needed.\n\n3. Next steps:\n   - Test whether a subset of objects (e.g., 0,1,2) can turn the machine on to rule out the \"all objects required\" hypothesis.\n   - If the light doesn't turn on with a subset, it supports the additive rule (all objects are blickets and all are required).\n\n**Command:**\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
