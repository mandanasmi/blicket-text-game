Initially, putting objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine didn't turn it on. Only when object 3 was added did the machine turn on.\n2. When object 0 was removed (leaving objects 1, 2, 3), the machine stayed on.\n3. When object 1 was removed (leaving objects 2, 3), the machine turned off.\n4. Adding object 1 back (objects 1, 2, 3) turned the machine on again.\n5. Removing object 2 (leaving objects 1, 3) kept the machine on.\n6. Removing object 1 (leaving only object 3) turned the machine off.\n7. Adding object 1 back (objects 1, 3) turned the machine on again.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the machine turns on when both object 1 and object 3 are present. Neither object alone is sufficient to turn on the machine (as seen when only object 3 was on the machine and it was off).
