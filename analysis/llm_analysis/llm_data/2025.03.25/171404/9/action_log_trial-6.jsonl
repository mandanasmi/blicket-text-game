Initially, putting objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine didn't turn it on. Only when object 3 was added did the machine turn on.\n2. When object 0 was removed (with 1, 2, 3 remaining), the machine turned off.\n3. Later, putting just object 0 on the machine (with 3 already on) turned the machine on.\n4. Adding object 1 or 2 to the machine (with 0 and 3 already on) kept the machine on, but removing object 0 turned it off again.\n\nThis suggests:\n- Object 3 alone doesn't turn on the machine (since with just 3 on, machine was off)\n- Object 0 seems to be a blicket (since adding it turns on the machine when 3 is present)\n- Objects 1 and 2 don't seem to affect the machine's state when added/removed\n- The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when both object 0 and object 3 are on it (an AND relationship)\n\nSince object 2's presence/absence doesn't affect the machine's state, it's not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
