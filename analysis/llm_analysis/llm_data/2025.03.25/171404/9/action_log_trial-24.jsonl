Initially, only object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When objects 1, 2, and 3 were all placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n3. Removing object 1 kept the light on, but removing object 2 turned the light off, suggesting object 2 is critical for activation.\n4. Later, placing just object 3 didn't activate the machine, but placing object 2 with object 3 did activate it.\n5. The machine only turned on when object 2 was present on it, regardless of other objects.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that object 2 is the blicket, and object 3 is not (since placing it alone didn't activate the machine, and it only activated when paired with object 2).\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
