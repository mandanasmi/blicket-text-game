When objects 0, 1, and 2 were on the machine together, the machine turned on. Then when object 0 was removed, it turned off, suggesting object 0 is necessary for activation.\n2. Later, putting just objects 0 and 2 on the machine turned it on again, confirming object 0's importance.\n3. Object 3 was never part of any combination that turned the machine on (when 0, 1, 2, 3 were on, it didn't turn on; when 2 and 3 were on, it didn't turn on; when 0 and 3 were on, it didn't turn on).\n4. The machine only turned on when object 0 was present in combination with at least one other object (either 1 or 2).\n\nSince object 3 never contributed to turning the machine on in any combination, it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
