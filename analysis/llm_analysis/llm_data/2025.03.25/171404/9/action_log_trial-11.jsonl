When only object 0 was on the machine, the light was off.\n2. When objects 0 and 1 were on the machine, the light turned on.\n3. When object 0 was removed (leaving only object 1), the light turned off.\n4. Later, when objects 0 and 1 were on the machine again, the light turned on.\n5. Adding object 2 or 3 to object 1 didn't turn the light on (when object 0 wasn't present).\n6. The light only turned on when both object 0 and object 1 were on the machine together.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n- The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when both object 0 AND object 1 are on it (a conjunctive rule).\n- Object 3 never caused the machine to turn on in any combination, and its presence didn't affect the outcome when other objects were present.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
