In another test, objects 1 and 3 together turned the light on, but removing object 3 turned it off (while object 1 remained).\n\nThe key observations are:\n- Object 3 alone can turn the machine on.\n- The machine stays on as long as object 3 is present, regardless of other objects.\n- When object 3 is removed, the machine turns off even if other objects remain.\n\nThis strongly suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
