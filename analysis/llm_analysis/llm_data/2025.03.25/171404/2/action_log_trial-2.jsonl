Initial tests showed that putting any single object (0-7) on the machine turns it on.\n2. However, when I removed objects one by one, the machine stayed on until object 5 was removed - then it turned off.\n3. This suggests that while multiple objects can turn the machine on, only object 5 is essential to keep it on (i.e., the machine turns off only when object 5 is removed).\n\nHypothesis: \n- Object 5 is likely the only true blicket (the one that actually affects the machine state)\n- The machine turns on when any object is placed on it, but only stays on as long as object 5 remains on it\n- Other objects may be \"false positives\" that can trigger the initial activation but aren't necessary for maintaining it\n\nTo confirm this, I should test:\n1. Put only object 5 on the machine (should turn on and stay on)\n2. Remove object 5 (should turn off)\n3.
