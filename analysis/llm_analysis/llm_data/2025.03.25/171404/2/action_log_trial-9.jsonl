Removing 3 and 2 kept machine on (with 0,1,4,5,6 on machine)\n8. Removing 6 turned machine off \u2192 suggests 6 is critical\n\nKey observations:\n- Machine turns on when both object 2 and object 6 are on it\n- Other objects don't seem to affect the machine state\n- Machine turns off when either 2 or 6 is removed\n\nTherefore, blickets are likely objects 2 and 6, and the rule is that the machine turns on when both are placed on it (AND rule).\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test removing other objects to see if they affect the machine state when both 2 and 6 are present.\n\n> take object 0 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
