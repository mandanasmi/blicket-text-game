Objects 2,4,5,6 together turned on light, but removing 4 turned it off.\n6. Object 4 seems crucial - when present with others, light is on; when removed, light turns off.\n\nKey patterns:\n- Object 7 alone can turn on the machine\n- Object 4 seems to be another blicket that can turn on the machine when combined with others\n- Other objects don't seem to affect the machine's state\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 4 alone to see if it can turn on the machine by itself.\n\n> take object 7 off the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

When object 7 was alone on the machine (initial state), the machine was on.\n2. When object 7 was removed (keeping object 0), the machine turned off.\n3. When object 7 was added back (with object 1), the machine turned on.\n4. When object 7 was removed (keeping object 1), the machine turned off.\n5. When object 7 was added back (with object 1), the machine turned on.\n6. Later tests show the machine stays on when object 7 is removed if other blickets (like 4) are present.\n\nThe key observations are:\n- The machine turns on when object 7 is present (even alone)\n- The machine turns off when object 7 is removed (unless other blickets are present)\n- This shows object 7's state directly affects the machine's state\n\nTherefore, object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
