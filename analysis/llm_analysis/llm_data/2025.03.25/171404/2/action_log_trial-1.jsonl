You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

When objects 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were placed on the machine without object 6 or object 2, the machine did not turn on (it only turned on when object 6 or 2 was present).\n4. Specifically for object 7: when it was placed on the machine along with other objects (including blickets), the machine turned on, but we never saw it turn on the machine by itself. The machine's state when object 7 was placed alone wasn't tested, but given that it didn't turn on when placed with non-blickets (objects 0, 1), it's unlikely to be a blicket.\n\nSince a blicket must be able to turn on the machine by itself (or in some combination where its presence is necessary), and object 7 never demonstrated this capability, it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
