Key observation: The machine seems to require at least two specific objects to be on it simultaneously to activate.\n\nHypothesis: The rule is that the machine turns on when any two blickets are on it simultaneously. From the interactions, objects 0 and 2 seem to be blickets because:\n- Object 0 alone activates it (but this contradicts the two-object rule, so maybe initial observation was misleading)\nWait, let me re-examine:\nActually, when object 0 was first put on empty machine, it turned on, but later putting object 0 on didn't turn it on unless combined with others. This suggests the rule might be more complex - perhaps the machine turns on when the number of blickets on it is odd.\n\nBut the most consistent pattern seems to be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
