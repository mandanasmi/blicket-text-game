Initially, putting objects 0-4, 6, and 7 on the machine did not turn it on. Only when object 5 was added did the machine turn on.\n2. Later, putting object 1 on the machine (with object 5 already on it) turned the machine on again.\n3. When object 1 was removed (with object 5 still on), the machine turned off.\n4. When object 1 was added back (with object 5 still on), the machine turned on again.\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- Object 5 is likely a blicket (since the machine turned on when it was first added alone)\n- Object 1 is likely also a blicket (since adding it later caused activation when combined with object 5)\n- Objects 0-4, 6, and 7 did not cause activation when placed alone or in combination (except with object 5), suggesting they are not blickets.\n\nSince object 7 never caused activation in any test, it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
