When we put objects 1,2,3 on machine - light stayed off\n3. When we put object 4 on machine (with 1,2,3 already on) - light turned on\n4. Removing 1,2,3 kept light on (with just 4 on machine)\n5. Removing 4 turned light off\n6. Other objects (5,6,7) didn't turn light on when placed alone\n\nKey insights:\n- Object 4 seems to be a blicket since it alone can turn on the machine\n- Other objects don't seem to affect the machine\n- The rule might be that the machine turns on when any blicket is present (in this case just object 4)\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 4 alone on the machine.\n\n> put object 4 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
