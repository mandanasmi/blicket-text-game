Initial tests with objects 0-3 didn't turn on the machine.\n2. Adding object 4 turned the machine on.\n3. Removing objects 0-2 didn't turn it off, but removing object 3 did turn it off.\n4. Later tests show that object 3 alone doesn't turn it on, but object 4 alone does.\n5. When both 3 and 4 are on, the machine stays on.\n\nThis suggests:\n- Object 4 is definitely a blicket (can turn on machine by itself)\n- Object 3 might be a conditional blicket (only works with 4)\n- Objects 0-2 are likely not blickets\n\nThe rule appears to be: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, but object 3 only works as a blicket when object 4 is also present (an \"AND\" relationship between 3 and 4).\n\nTo confirm this, I should test object 5-7 to see if any others can turn on the machine alone or in combination with 4.\n\n> put object 5 on the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
