The machine turns on when object 1 is placed on it alone (first interaction).\n2. The machine turns on when object 0 + object 1 are on it (third interaction).\n3. The machine turns on when object 0 + object 4 are on it (fourth interaction).\n4. The machine turns on when object 1 + object 7 are on it (sixth interaction).\n5. The machine turns off when object 1 is removed (multiple times).\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- Object 1 is definitely a blicket (activates machine alone and in combinations).\n- Object 4 appears to activate the machine when combined with object 0 (another blicket), but never alone or with non-blickets.\n- The rule seems to be \"the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present\".\n\nSince object 4 only activates the machine when combined with another blicket (object 0), but not alone or with non-blickets (like object 2 or 3), it is not itself a blicket.
