However, when removing objects one by one, the light turns off only after removing object 3 (and later object 4). This suggests that the machine's state depends on the presence of specific objects (likely blickets), not just any object.\n3. The light stayed on after removing objects 0, 1, and 2, but turned off after removing object 3. This implies object 3 is a blicket. Similarly, removing object 4 also turned the light off, suggesting object 4 is also a blicket.\n4. To confirm, I need to test combinations of objects to see if the rule is additive (e.g., the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present) or if it requires a specific combination.\n\n**Next Step:**\nTest whether the machine turns on with only object 3 or object 4, or if it requires both.

Initially, putting any single object on the machine turns it on (objects 0-7). This suggests that any single object can activate the machine, but doesn't help identify blickets yet.\n2. When removing objects 0-2, the machine stays on, but removing object 3 turns it off. This suggests object 3 is special.\n3. Later tests show that object 3 alone can turn on the machine, and removing it turns the machine off even when other objects are present.\n4. Object 6 was only tested once (initial test) where it turned on the machine when placed alone, but we haven't seen its behavior in combination with other objects or when removed.\n\nThe key insight is that object 3 seems to be the only object that consistently affects the machine's state - it appears to be the only blicket. Other objects may turn on the machine when placed alone, but don't maintain the machine's state when removed (except object 3).
