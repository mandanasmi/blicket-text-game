Initially, object 4 was on the machine and the light was off.\n2. Objects 0, 1, 2, 4 were placed on the machine individually and in combinations, but the light never turned on.\n3. When object 3 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on.\n4. Object 5 alone didn't turn on the machine.\n5. Objects 6 and 7 each turned on the machine when placed alone.\n6. Object 3 was confirmed to turn on the machine again when placed alone.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that objects 3, 6, and 7 each have the ability to turn on the machine by themselves (they are blickets), while objects 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 do not.\n\nSince object 7 turned on the machine when placed alone, it must be a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
