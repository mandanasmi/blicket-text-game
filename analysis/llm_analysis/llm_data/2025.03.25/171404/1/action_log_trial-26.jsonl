Initial state: Objects 2 & 3 on machine - light off\n2. Adding objects 0,1,4 didn't turn on light\n3. Adding object 5 turned on light (first indication it might be a blicket)\n4. Removing other objects while keeping 5 kept light on\n5. Adding objects 6,7 didn't affect light (they're likely not blickets)\n6. Removing 5 turned light off, adding it back turned it on (confirms 5 is a blicket)\n7. Adding 0 with 5 kept light on, but earlier adding 0 alone didn't turn it on (0 is not a blicket)\n\nKey observations:\n- Object 5 alone can turn on the machine\n- Other objects don't turn it on alone or in combination (without 5)\n- The rule appears to be \"machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it\"\n- So far only object 5 is confirmed as a blicket\n\nNext step: Test if any other objects might be blickets by trying combinations that don't include 5.\n\n> put object 2 on the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
