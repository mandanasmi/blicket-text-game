Based on my interactions so far, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When I removed it, the light remained on, indicating that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on, but when I removed it, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on, but when I removed it, the light turned off. This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom this, I can infer that:\n- Object 0 is not a blicket.\n- Objects 1, 2, and 3 are likely blickets.\n\nNext, I need to determine the rule for how the machine turns on. The light turns on when at least one of the blickets is present on the machine. Since the light turned off when I removed object 2 and object 3, it indicates that at least one of them is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\nTo further confirm my findings, I should test the combinations of the objects that I suspect are blickets (objects 1, 2, and 3) to see if the machine consistently turns on with them. \n\nSince I have already established that object 1 is a blicket, I will now test object 2 and object 3 together to see if the machine turns on with both of them.\n\nTherefore, my next command will be to put object 2 and object 3 on the machine together.\n\n> put object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
