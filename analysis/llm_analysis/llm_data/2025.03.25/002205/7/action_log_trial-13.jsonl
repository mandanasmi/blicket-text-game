This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nSo far, I have identified:\n- **Blickets**: Object 0, Object 2, Object 3\n- **Not a blicket**: Object 1\n\nNext, I need to determine the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. The machine turns on when at least one of the blickets is placed on it. Since object 1 did not activate the machine, it confirms that it is not a blicket.\n\nTo further confirm my findings, I can test combinations of the identified blickets (objects 0, 2, and 3) to see if the machine consistently turns on. However, since I have already established that at least one of these objects activates the machine, I can conclude that the rule is likely that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now execute a command to confirm the status of the identified blickets by placing them all on the machine.\n\n> put object 0 on machine; put object 2 on machine; put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nSo far, I have identified:\n- **Blickets**: Object 0, Object 2, Object 3\n- **Not a blicket**: Object 1\n\nNext, I need to determine if there is a specific rule governing the machine's behavior. The machine turned on with:\n- Object 0 alone\n- Object 2 alone\n- Object 3 alone\n- Object 2 and Object 3 together\n\nSince the machine turned on with each of these objects individually, it seems that the rule may be that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. \n\nTo further confirm this, I can test the combination of objects. I will put object 0, object 2, and object 3 on the machine together to see if the machine still activates, which it should based on my previous findings.\n\nThus, my final command will be:\n> put object 0 on machine; put object 2 on machine; put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
