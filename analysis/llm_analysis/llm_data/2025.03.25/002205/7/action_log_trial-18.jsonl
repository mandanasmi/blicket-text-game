When any object (0, 1, 2, or 3) was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that at least one of these objects has blicktness.\n2. When object 2 was taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 must be a blicket.\n3. When object 0 and object 1 were taken off the machine, the light remained on, suggesting that at least one of them is also a blicket.\n4. When object 3 was taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that object 3 does not have blicktness.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
