Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: Similar to object 0, when placed on the machine, the light turned on, and it turned off when removed. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFrom the above observations, we can conclude that both object 0 and object 1 are blickets, while object 2 is not. Object 3 also caused the machine to turn on when placed on it, indicating that it is likely a blicket as well.\n\nThus, based on the evidence, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
