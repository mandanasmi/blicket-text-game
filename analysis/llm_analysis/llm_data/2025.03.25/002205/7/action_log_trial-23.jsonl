This indicates that object 0 is also likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: Similar to object 0, the light stays on when object 2 is placed on the machine and remains on after removal. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: The same behavior is observed with object 3; the light stays on when it is placed on the machine and remains on after removal. This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom this, it appears that all four objects (0, 1, 2, and 3) are blickets since they all cause the machine to turn on when placed on it, and the light remains on after they are removed.\n\nNext, I need to confirm the rule governing the machine. The consistent behavior of the machine suggests that it turns on when at least one blicket is present on it. Since all objects have been shown to activate the machine, I can conclude that the rule is likely that the machine turns on when any blicket is placed on it.\n\nTo finalize my findings, I will exit the game and provide my conclusions.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
