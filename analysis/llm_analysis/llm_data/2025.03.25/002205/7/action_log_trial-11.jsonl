Based on the interactions so far, I have the following observations:\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - When I put object 0 on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When I put object 1 on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n   - When I put object 2 on the machine, the light also turned on, suggesting that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - When I put object 3 on the machine, the light remained on, indicating that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing for Non-Blickets**:\n   - I took object 1 off the machine, and the light remained on. This suggests that object 1 is not necessary for the machine to stay on, indicating that at least one of the other objects (2 or 3) is sufficient to keep the machine on.\n   - I then took object 2 off the machine, and the light turned off. This indicates that object 2 is indeed a blicket, as its removal caused the machine to turn off.\n\n3. **Current Understanding**:\n   - Object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is likely not a blicket since the machine stayed on after its removal.\n   - Object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is still uncertain, but since the machine remained on with object 1 removed, it suggests that object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - To confirm the status of object 3, I should take object 3 off the machine and see if the light turns off. If it does, then object 3 is not a blicket. If it stays on, then object 3 is a blicket.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be to take object 3 off the machine to test its effect.\n\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
