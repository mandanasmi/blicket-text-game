Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered during the interactions with the machine.\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - When any object (0, 1, 2, or 3) was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that at least one of the objects is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Individual Objects**:\n   - When object 0 was taken off, the light remained on, indicating that object 0 is not necessary for the machine to be on.\n   - The same was true for object 1; when it was taken off, the light remained on.\n   - However, when object 2 was taken off, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was taken off, the light also turned off, indicating that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light turned off when both object 2 and object 3 were taken off, it indicates that both are necessary for the machine to be on. \n   - Therefore, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
