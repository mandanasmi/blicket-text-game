Based on my interactions so far, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When I removed it, the light remained on, indicating that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but when I removed it, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but when I removed it, the light turned off. This indicates that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom this, I can conclude that:\n- Object 0 is not a blicket.\n- Objects 1, 2, and 3 are blickets.\n\nNext, I need to determine the rule for how the machine turns on. The light turns on when at least one of the blickets (objects 1, 2, or 3) is present on the machine. The light turns off when all blickets are removed.\n\nTo further confirm my findings, I should test the machine with combinations of the identified blickets.
