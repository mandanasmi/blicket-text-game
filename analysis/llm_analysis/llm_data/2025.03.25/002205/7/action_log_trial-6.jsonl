Additionally, the light remains on when object 2 is removed and then placed back on the machine.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. However, when removed, the light turns off.\n\nFrom this, I can infer that:\n- Object 2 and Object 3 are likely blickets since they can turn the machine on.\n- Object 0 and Object 1 do not activate the machine, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nNext, I need to determine if the machine's activation is dependent on having one or both of the blickets (object 2 and object 3) present. Since the machine turned on with either object 2 or object 3 alone, it suggests that the machine can be activated by either object independently.\n\nTo further confirm this, I will test the combination of both objects (2 and 3) on the machine to see if the light remains on, which would reinforce the idea that both can activate the machine independently.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be to put both object 2 and object 3 on the machine to confirm their individual activation capabilities.\n\n> put object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
