Based on my interactions so far, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. Removing it did not turn the light off, indicating that it might not be a blicket or that the machine can still be activated by other objects.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. However, removing it turned the light off, suggesting that it is likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. Removing it turned the light off, indicating it is likely a blicket as well.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on initially, but when I put it back on after removing all other objects, the light did not turn on. This suggests that it may not be a blicket.\n\nFrom this, I can infer that:\n- Object 1 and Object 2 are likely blickets since their removal turned the light off.\n- Object 0 might not be a blicket since the light remained on after its removal.\n- Object 3 is likely not a blicket since it did not activate the machine when placed alone.\n\nNext, I need to confirm the status of Object 0 and Object 3. Since I suspect Object 0 is not a blicket, I will test Object 3 again to see if it can activate the machine alone. \n\nI will put Object 3 back on the machine to see if it activates the machine again.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
