When any of the objects (0, 1, 2, or 3) were placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that at least one of the objects has blicktness.\n2. When all objects were taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that at least one of the objects must have blicktness.\n3. Object 3 was the only object that, when taken off the machine, resulted in the light being off after all other objects were removed. This suggests that object 3 does not have blicktness, as the light remained off when it was the only object removed.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
