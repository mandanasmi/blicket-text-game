Based on my interactions so far, I have observed the following:\n\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When I took it off, the light turned off, indicating that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: Similar to object 1, when placed on the machine, the light turned on, and it remained on when I took object 1 off. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, but when I took it off, the light turned off. This indicates that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that objects 1, 2, and 3 are blickets, while object 0 is not. \n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that at least one blicket must be present on the machine for it to activate. Since the light turned on with any of the blickets present and turned off when all were removed, this supports the hypothesis.\n\nNow, I will confirm my findings by putting all three identified blickets (objects 1, 2, and 3) on the machine to see if the light remains on, which would further validate the rule.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
