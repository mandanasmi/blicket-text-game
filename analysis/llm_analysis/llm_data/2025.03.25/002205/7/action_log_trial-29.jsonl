This suggests that at least one of the objects is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Individual Objects**:\n   - When object 0 was taken off, the light remained on, indicating that object 0 is not necessary for the machine to be on.\n   - The same was true for object 1; when it was taken off, the light remained on.\n   - However, when object 2 was taken off, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was taken off, the light remained on, indicating that object 3 is also not necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light turned off when object 2 was removed, it confirms that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - The light remained on when object 3 was removed, suggesting that object 3 does not have the blicktness required to turn on the machine by itself.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
