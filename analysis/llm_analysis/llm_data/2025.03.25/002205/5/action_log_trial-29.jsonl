This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Object 4**: When I placed object 4 on the machine, the light turned on.

This suggests that object 5 is not a blicket, as its removal did not affect the machine's state.\n\n4. **Object 6**: When I placed object 6 on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 6 is also a blicket.\n\n5. **Object 7**: When I placed object 7 on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 7 is also a blicket.\n\n6. **Removing Objects**: When I removed object 4, the light turned off, confirming that it is a blicket. Removing object 6 also turned the light off, confirming it as a blicket. Removing object 7 turned the light off as well, confirming it as a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that:\n- Object 4, object 6, and object 7 are blickets.\n- Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 are not blickets.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be present on the machine for it to activate.\n\nNow, I will finalize my command to exit the game, as I believe I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
