Object 6 did not contribute to turning the machine on when tested alone, suggesting it is not a blicket. \n- **Other Objects**: Objects 0, 1, 2, and 3 were tested but did not turn the machine on when placed alone. However, since the machine turned on with object 4, it suggests that the presence of object 4 is crucial for the machine to activate.\n\n### Rule Inference:\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be related to the presence of object 4. It could be that the machine requires at least one specific object (in this case, object 4) to activate, or it could be that a combination of objects is necessary, but so far, object 4 is the only one confirmed to activate the machine.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further confirm the status of the other objects, I should test them in combinations or isolate them to see if any other object can activate the machine. However, since I have already established that object 4 is a blicket, I can conclude that for now.\n\n### Final Command:\nTo further explore the relationship, I will put object 1 on the machine again to see if it has any effect, even though it previously did not activate the machine.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
