Here's a summary of my findings so far:\n\n1. **Initial Tests**: I placed objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Positive Tests**: When I placed object 5 on the machine, the light turned on. The same happened with object 6. This indicates that at least one of these two objects (5 or 6) is a blicket.\n\n3. **Isolation Tests**: I removed both objects 5 and 6 from the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that the machine does not turn on without a blicket present. When I placed object 5 back on the machine, the light turned on again, and the same occurred with object 6.\n\n4. **Combination Tests**: I attempted to put both objects 5 and 6 on the machine simultaneously, but the command was not recognized. However, since both objects independently turned the machine on, it suggests that both could be blickets.\n\nNext, I need to confirm whether both objects 5 and 6 are blickets or if only one of them is. To do this, I will conduct a test by placing both objects on the machine together to see if the light remains on. If it does, it will confirm that at least one of them is a blicket, and if the light turns off, it will indicate that only one of them is a blicket.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be to put both objects 5 and 6 on the machine together.\n\n> put object 5 on machine; put object 6 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This indicates that object 7 might also be a blicket.\n   - However, I need to confirm whether object 7 is a blicket by testing it in isolation or in combination with the other objects.\n\n3. **Next Steps**:\n   - I should test object 7 by itself to see if it can turn the machine on without the presence of objects 5 and 6. This will help me determine if object 7 is a blicket or if it only turns the machine on in combination with other objects.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be to take objects 5 and 6 off the machine and then put object 7 on the machine to see if it activates the machine by itself.\n\n> take object 5 off machine; take object 6 off machine; put object 7 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This suggests that at least one of them is a blicket.\n2. **Object 7**: When placed on the machine, the light also turns on, indicating that it may also be a blicket.\n3. **Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4**: None of these objects turned the machine on when placed on it, suggesting that they are not blickets.\n\nNext, I need to determine if the machine turns on with combinations of objects. Since I have already established that objects 5, 6, and 7 can turn the machine on individually, I should test combinations of these objects to see if they can turn the machine on together or if they are dependent on each other.\n\nTo further explore this, I will put objects 5, 6, and 7 on the machine together to see if the machine remains on.
