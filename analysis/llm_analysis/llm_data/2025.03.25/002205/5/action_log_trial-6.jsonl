This suggests that either none of these objects are blickets, or that the machine requires a specific combination of objects to activate. \n\nTo efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine, I should consider the following:\n\n1. **Testing Combinations**: Since I have not yet seen any object activate the machine, I should start testing combinations of objects. This will help me determine if the machine requires multiple objects to turn on.\n\n2. **Testing Remaining Objects**: I still have three objects (5, 6, and 7) that I have not tested yet. I should test these objects individually to see if any of them can activate the machine.\n\n3. **Observing Patterns**: If I find that a single object activates the machine, I can then explore combinations of objects to see if they also activate the machine.\n\nGiven that I have not yet tested objects 5, 6, and 7, I will start by testing object 5. \n\n> put object 5 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
