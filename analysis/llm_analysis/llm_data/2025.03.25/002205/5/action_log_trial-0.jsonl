Here's a summary of my findings so far:\n\n1. **Initial Tests**: I placed objects 0 through 6 on the machine, and the light remained off for all of them. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets, as they did not activate the machine.\n\n2. **Object 7**: When I placed object 7 on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 7 is likely a blicket. I confirmed this by taking it off the machine, which turned the light off, and then placing it back on, which turned the light on again. This consistent behavior strongly suggests that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 0**: I attempted to take object 0 off the machine after placing it, but it was already on the floor. This indicates that I may have made a mistake in my commands, as I was trying to manipulate the state of object 0 incorrectly.\n\nGiven the current understanding, I can conclude that:\n- Object 7 is a blicket.\n- Objects 0 through 6 are not blickets.\n\nNext, I need to determine if there are any additional rules or interactions that I can explore. Since I have already established that object 7 activates the machine, I can now focus on confirming that no other objects can activate the machine.\n\nTo further solidify my findings, I will put object 7 back on the machine and observe the light.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

This suggests that object 7 has a special property (blicktness) that is related to the machine's activation.\n\nWhen object 7 was removed from the machine, the light turned off, and when it was placed back on, the light turned on again. This consistent behavior indicates that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\nIn contrast, object 0 was placed on the machine multiple times, and the light remained on regardless of its presence, which suggests that it does not have the same effect as object 7.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
