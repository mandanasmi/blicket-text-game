When I took it off, the light turned off, and when I placed it back on, the light turned on. This suggests that object 0 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the tests, I suspect that both object 0 and object 7 are blickets since their presence on the machine correlates with the machine being on. \n   - Objects 1 through 6 do not seem to affect the machine, indicating they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I need to confirm my hypothesis about the rule governing the machine. So far, it seems that the machine turns on when at least one of the blickets (object 0 or object 7) is present on the machine.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now finalize my command to put object 0 back on the machine to confirm that it is indeed a blicket and to see if the machine responds consistently.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
