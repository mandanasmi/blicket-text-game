However, when I took object 1 off, the machine remained off, suggesting that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**: I then tested each object (2 through 7) by placing them on the machine one at a time. Each time, the machine remained off, indicating that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Tests**: Since the machine only turned off when I removed object 0, it strongly suggests that object 0 is the only blicket among the objects tested. Object 1 is not a blicket, and neither are objects 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n4. **Rule Inference**: The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that it requires at least one blicket (in this case, object 0) to be present on it to activate. Since all other objects tested did not activate the machine, they are likely not contributing to the machine's state.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: I need to confirm my findings by testing the machine with object 0 alone to see if it activates the machine again. This will solidify my conclusion that object 0 is indeed the blicket.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will execute the command to put object 0 back on the machine to confirm its status as a blicket.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
