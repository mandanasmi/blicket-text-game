Object 7 was also not able to turn the machine on when it was alone.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**: \n   - When I put object 4 on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - When I put object 5 on the machine, the light also turned on, indicating that object 5 is likely a blicket as well.\n   - Removing object 4 turned the machine off, confirming its status as a blicket. However, removing object 5 did not turn the machine off, which suggests that object 5 might not be a blicket or that it interacts with other objects.\n\n3. **Further Testing**: \n   - I put object 6 on the machine, and the light remained off, indicating that object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - The repeated attempts to put object 5 on the machine while it was already there did not change the state of the machine, reinforcing that object 5 does not independently activate the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the interactions, I can conclude that object 4 is definitely a blicket. Object 5's status is uncertain, but it may not be a blicket since it did not independently activate the machine when tested alone. Object 6 is confirmed not to be a blicket.\n\nNext, I will test object 5 in isolation to see if it can activate the machine by itself. \n\n> take object 5 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

When I removed object 5, the machine remained on, suggesting that object 5 is also a blicket.\n4. **Reinforcement of Findings**: I repeatedly placed and removed objects 4 and 5, confirming that the machine's state was dependent on these two objects.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that:\n- **Blickets**: Object 4 and object 5 are likely blickets because their presence on the machine consistently turned it on.\n- **Non-Blickets**: Objects 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, and 7 do not seem to affect the machine's state in a way that indicates they are blickets.\n\nThe rule for the machine appears to be that it turns on when at least one blicket (object 4 or object 5) is present on the machine.\n\nNow, I will finalize my command to exit the game, as I believe I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
