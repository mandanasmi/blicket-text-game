This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n   - When I removed object 0, the light remained on, indicating that object 0 is not the only blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 also kept the light on, suggesting that object 1 is also not the only blicket.\n   - However, when I removed object 2, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was on the machine, but when I took object 2 off, the light was off, suggesting that object 3 might not be a blicket either.\n\n2. **Current Understanding**:\n   - Objects 0 and 1 are likely blickets since the light remained on when they were removed.\n   - Object 2 is definitely not a blicket since the light turned off when it was removed.\n   - Object 3's status is uncertain, but since the light was off when it was the only object on the machine, it is likely not a blicket.\n\n3. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to confirm the status of object 3. I will take object 3 off the machine to see if the light turns off. If it does, then object 3 is not a blicket.

This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n   - When I removed object 2 from the machine, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is not a blicket since the machine turned off when it was removed.\n\n2. **Further Testing**:\n   - Object 0 and object 1 consistently kept the light on when placed on the machine, even when removed and replaced.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, did not turn the light on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the tests, it appears that object 0 and object 1 are blickets since they consistently keep the machine on when present. Object 2 is not a blicket, and object 3 is also not a blicket.\n\n4. **Rule Inference**:\n   - The rule for the machine seems to be that the presence of either object 0 or object 1 (or both) is required for the machine to turn on. Object 2 and object 3 do not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now finalize my command to exit the game, as I believe I have identified the blickets and inferred the underlying rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
