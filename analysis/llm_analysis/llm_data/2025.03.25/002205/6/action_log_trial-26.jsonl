Based on my interactions so far, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - When I put object 0 on the machine, the light remained off.\n   - When I put object 1, object 2, and object 3 on the machine, the light turned on for each of them.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I took object 1, object 2, and object 3 off the machine one by one, and the light remained on when object 1 and object 2 were removed, but turned off when object 3 was removed. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, while object 1 and object 2 are likely blickets.\n\n3. **Reinforcement of Findings**:\n   - When I put object 1 back on the machine, the light turned on again, confirming that it is a blicket. The same applies to object 2.\n   - Object 0 is confirmed not to be a blicket since it did not activate the machine when placed on it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, I can conclude that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, while objects 0 and 3 are not.\n\n5. **Rule Inference**:\n   - The rule for the machine seems to be that it turns on when at least one blicket is present on it. Since both objects 1 and 2 activated the machine, they are the blickets.\n\nNow, I will finalize my command to exit the game, as I believe I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
