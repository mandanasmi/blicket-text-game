When I put object 3 on the machine, the light turned on, but taking it off turned the light off. This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that all four objects (0, 1, 2, and 3) are blickets since they all caused the machine to turn on when placed on it and turned it off when removed.\n\nNext, I need to consider the rule for how the machine operates. Since all objects turned the machine on individually, the rule could be that any object placed on the machine will activate it, indicating that the machine responds positively to any object.\n\nTo confirm my findings, I will conduct a final test by putting all objects back on the machine to see if the light turns on again.\n\n> put object 0 on machine; put object 1 on machine; put object 2 on machine; put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
