Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information collected during the game:\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - When object 0 was on the machine, the light was on.\n   - When object 1 was put on the machine, the light was off.\n   - When object 2 was put on the machine, the light was off.\n   - When object 3 was put on the machine, the light was on.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - Object 0 alone can turn the machine on.\n   - Object 3 alone can also turn the machine on.\n   - Object 1 and object 2 did not turn the machine on when tested individually.\n\n3. **Repetitive Commands**:\n   - The commands involving combinations of objects (like \"put object 0 and object 3 on machine\") were not recognized, indicating that the game does not allow for simultaneous placement of multiple objects in that manner.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 3 can turn the machine on by itself, it is reasonable to conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
