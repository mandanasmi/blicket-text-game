Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the interactions with the machine and the objects:\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - When object 3 was on the machine, the light was on.\n   - When object 3 was taken off, the light turned off.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - Object 0, when placed on the machine, turned the light on.\n   - Object 1 also turned the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - Object 2 did not turn the light on when it was the only object on the machine, as seen when it was taken off and the light remained off.\n\n3. **Interactions with Object 3**:\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, and the light was consistently on.\n   - When object 3 was taken off, the light was still on, indicating that the light does not depend solely on object 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light was on with object 3 on the machine, but also remained on with other objects, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket. It could be that other objects are responsible for the light being on.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot confirm that object 3 is a blicket based on the information gathered.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
