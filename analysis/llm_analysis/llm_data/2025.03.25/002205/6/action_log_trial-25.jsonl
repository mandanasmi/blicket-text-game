This suggests that neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When I put object 2 on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - When I put object 3 on the machine, the light also turned on, suggesting that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Tests**:\n   - I took object 2 off the machine, and the light remained on. This indicates that object 2 is definitely a blicket since the machine still responded positively.\n   - I took object 3 off the machine, and the light turned off. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, as the machine only turned on when object 2 was present.\n   - When I put object 2 back on the machine, the light turned on again, confirming that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the tests, I can conclude that object 2 is a blicket. Object 3 is not a blicket since the machine turned off when it was removed. Objects 0 and 1 are also not blickets since they did not activate the machine at all.\n\n4. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - The rule seems to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it. Since object 2 is the only confirmed blicket, the machine's behavior aligns with this understanding.\n\nNow, I will summarize my findings:\n- **Blickets**: Object 2\n- **Rule**: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it.\n\nSince I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule, I will exit the task.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
