This suggests that Object 2 might not be a blicket, or there is a specific condition for it to be a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, I can conclude that Object 0 and Object 3 are definitely blickets.\n   - Object 1 is definitely not a blicket.\n   - Object 2's status is uncertain due to the inconsistency observed when it was taken off the machine.\n\n5. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to further test Object 2 to clarify its status.
