You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 3 was put on the machine, the light was on.\n5. Removing object 2 or object 3 turned the light off, indicating that at least one of them is a blicket.\n6. Object 0 also turned the light on when placed on the machine, suggesting it is a blicket as well.\n7. Object 1 did not turn the light on when placed on the machine, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nFrom the above observations, we know:\n- Object 0 is a blicket.\n- Object 1 is not a blicket.\n- Object 2 is a blicket (since it turned the light on when placed on the machine and was confirmed off when removed).\n- Object 3 is also a blicket (since it turned the light on when placed on the machine).\n\nSince object 3 turned the light on when placed on the machine, it is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
