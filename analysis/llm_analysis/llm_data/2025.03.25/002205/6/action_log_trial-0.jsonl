This will help clarify if there is a specific object that is necessary for the machine to remain on or if all objects are blickets.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be to take all objects off the machine to see if the light turns off.

This suggests that they might not be blickets either.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - It seems that object 0 is the only object that consistently keeps the machine on, while object 3 does not seem to be a blicket since it turned the machine off when removed. Object 1 and object 2 also did not activate the machine when tested alone.\n\n5. **Rule Inference**:\n   - The rule for the machine seems to be that it turns on when at least one specific object (likely object 0) is present on the machine. The other objects (1, 2, and 3) do not seem to activate the machine independently.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will conclude that object 0 is a blicket, while objects 1, 2, and 3 are not. The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when object 0 is present.\n\nNow, I will execute the command to take object 3 off the machine to confirm the final state.\n\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
