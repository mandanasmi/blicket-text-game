However, when I removed both, the machine turned off, confirming that at least one of these two objects is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing**:\n   - I confirmed that object 6 consistently turned the machine on when placed on it, while object 7 did not turn it on when placed alone after testing. This suggests that object 6 is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 7's behavior is less clear, as it did not turn the machine on when placed alone after testing.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the tests, I can conclude that object 6 is a blicket.
