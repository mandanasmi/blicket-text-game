I attempted to put combinations of objects on the machine, but the light remained on as long as object 0 was included. This suggests that the presence of object 0 is sufficient to turn the machine on, regardless of the other objects.\n\nGiven this information, I need to confirm that object 0 is the only blicket by testing combinations without it. I will take object 0 off the machine and then put a combination of the other objects (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) on the machine to see if any of them can turn the machine on without object 0.\n\nTo further explore this, I will put all the other objects (1 to 7) on the machine to see if the light turns on.
