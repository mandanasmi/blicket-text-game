This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light also turns on.

This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nI have also confirmed that the machine can be turned on with either object 1 or object 3 alone, and that removing object 1 turns the machine off, while putting it back on turns it on again. The same applies to object 3.\n\nGiven this information, I can conclude that:\n- **Blickets**: Object 1 and Object 3\n- **Non-blickets**: Objects 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7\n\nThe underlying rule appears to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since both object 1 and object 3 can independently turn the machine on, I can infer that the rule is likely that the presence of any blicket (object 1 or object 3) activates the machine.\n\nNow, I will proceed to confirm my findings by putting both object 1 and object 3 on the machine to see if the machine remains on, which would further validate my conclusion.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
