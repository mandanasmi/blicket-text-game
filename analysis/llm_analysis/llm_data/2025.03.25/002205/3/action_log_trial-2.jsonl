This suggests that there may be an issue with how I am identifying the objects or how the commands are being processed.\n\nTo effectively identify the blickets and the rule for the machine, I need to ensure that I can interact with the objects correctly. Since I have not been able to successfully manipulate any objects, I should first try to gather more information about the objects and the machine.\n\nMy plan is to continue using the \"look\" command to see if there are any changes in the environment or if I can gather more information about the objects.
