This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Object 4**: When I removed object 4 from the machine, the light remained off.

When I took object 7 off, the light remained on, which means that object 7 must also be a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Tests**: I confirmed that object 6 is a blicket by placing it back on the machine, and the light turned on again. However, when I placed object 7 back on the machine, the light was off, which indicates that the combination of objects matters.\n\nFrom this analysis, I can conclude:\n- Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are not blickets.\n- Objects 6 and 7 are blickets.\n\nNow, I need to determine the rule for how the machine turns on. It seems that the machine turns on when at least one of the blickets (6 or 7) is present on the machine. \n\nTo further confirm this, I will conduct a test by placing both objects 6 and 7 on the machine together to see if the light turns on, which would reinforce the idea that the presence of either object activates the machine.\n\nThus, my next command will be:\n\n> put object 6 on machine; put object 7 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
