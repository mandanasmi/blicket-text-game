You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it.

The machine was off when no objects were on it, and it turned on when object 7 was placed on it.\n2. Object 7 was the only object that consistently turned the machine on when placed on it, as evidenced by the fact that the light turned on when it was put on the machine and turned off when it was taken off.\n3. Object 5 was also on the machine, but it did not turn the machine on by itself when it was the only object present, as the light remained on regardless of its presence or absence.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 7 is indeed a blicket because it is the object that consistently activates the machine when placed on it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
