You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was on the machine multiple times, but the light remained off when it was the only object present. This suggests that object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - All other objects (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7) were tested in various combinations with no success in turning the machine on.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since object 2 is confirmed to be a blicket, and object 6 is not, we can infer that the other objects (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7) were not tested in a way that confirmed them as blickets.\n   - Object 7 was never tested on the machine, and since the machine did not turn on with any combination of the other objects, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we conclude that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
