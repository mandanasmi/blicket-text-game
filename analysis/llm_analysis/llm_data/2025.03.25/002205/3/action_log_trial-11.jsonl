Since I have already looked around multiple times without any change in the situation, I should try to interact with the machine in a different way.\n\nOne potential approach is to put the object that is currently on the machine (object 4) back on the floor, as it may be affecting the machine's state.

Since I cannot interact with the objects directly, I should focus on gathering more information about the environment and the objects.\n\nMy plan is to continue using the \"look\" command to see if there are any changes in the environment or if I can gather more information about the objects.

Since I cannot interact with the objects directly, I should focus on gathering more information about the environment and the objects.\n\nMy plan is to continue using the \"look\" command to see if there are any changes in the environment or if I can gather more information about the objects.
