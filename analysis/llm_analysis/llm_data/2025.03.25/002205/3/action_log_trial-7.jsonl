However, I encountered issues with the command format, which led to confusion in my attempts to test multiple objects at once.\n   - I need to isolate the objects that I suspect are blickets (5, 1, and 6) and test them individually or in pairs to confirm their status.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: \n   - I will focus on testing object 1 and object 6 together since they were both on the machine when the light was on.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

However, it was never tested alone or in combination with known non-blickets to confirm its status definitively.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 7 turned the machine on when placed on it, it is possible that it is a blicket. However, without further testing to isolate its effect, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding object 7 and the lack of definitive evidence to confirm it as a blicket, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
