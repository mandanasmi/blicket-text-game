You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n   - When I removed object 3, the light turned off, indicating that it is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 1 and 2 also kept the light on when they were on the machine, but I need to test them further to confirm their status.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**:\n   - I have already tested object 1 and 2 multiple times, and they consistently keep the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - Object 4 and 5 did not turn the machine on when placed on it, suggesting they are not blickets.\n   - Object 6 was initially on the machine but did not affect the light when I took it off, indicating it may not be a blicket.\n\n3. **Current Hypothesis**:\n   - Objects 1, 2, and 3 are likely blickets since they turned the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Objects 0, 4, 5, and 6 are likely not blickets since they did not turn the machine on.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to confirm the status of object 1 and 2 by testing them again in isolation or in combination with other objects that I suspect are not blickets.\n   - I will put object 1 and object 2 on the machine together to see if the machine turns on, which would further confirm their status as blickets.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will execute the command to put both object 1 and object 2 on the machine to test them together.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
