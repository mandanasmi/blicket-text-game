This suggests that object 0 is likely not a blicket.\n   - When I placed objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the machine, the light turned on each time.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. **Objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7**: When any of these objects were placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n3. **Removing objects**: When I removed object 6, the light turned off, indicating that object 6 is likely a blicket. However, when I put it back on, the light turned on again, confirming its blicket status. \n4. **Object 1**: I repeatedly tried to take it off the machine, but it was already on the floor, and the light remained on. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket, as its state does not affect the machine's state.\n5. **Object 5**: Similar to object 1, when I took it off, the light was off, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this information, I can conclude that objects 1, 5, and 0 are not blickets. The remaining objects (2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) are likely candidates for being blickets.\n\nNext, I need to determine the rule for how the machine turns on. The machine seems to turn on when at least one of the objects that I suspect to be a blicket is present. \n\nTo further narrow down which specific objects are blickets, I can conduct a test by placing only one object at a time on the machine and observing the light. However, since I have already gathered significant information, I can make an educated guess.\n\nI will now summarize my findings:\n- **Blickets**: Objects 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are likely blickets.\n- **Non-blickets**: Objects 0, 1, and 5 are not blickets.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will proceed with the command to put object 2 on the machine to test if it is a blicket.\n\n> put object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
