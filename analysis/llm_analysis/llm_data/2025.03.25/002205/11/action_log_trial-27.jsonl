When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 3**: Similar to object 2, placing it on the machine turned the light on, and removing it turned the light off. This suggests that object 3 is also likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 5**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that it might also be a blicket.\n4. **Object 6**: The same behavior was observed with object 6; it turned the light on when placed on the machine.\n5. **Object 4**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off, suggesting that it is not a blicket.\n6. **Object 7**: The light turned on when placed on the machine, indicating it might be a blicket.\n\nBased on this information, I can hypothesize that the objects that consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine (objects 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) are likely the blickets. \n\nNext, I need to confirm the rule for how the machine turns on.
