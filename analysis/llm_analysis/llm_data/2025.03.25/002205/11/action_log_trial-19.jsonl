However, I need to determine which specific objects are responsible for turning the machine on.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of my observations:\n1. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n4. **Object 3**: Initially on the machine, but I removed it without observing the light's state change.\n5. **Object 4**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n6. **Object 5**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n7. **Object 6**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n8. **Object 7**: Not yet tested.\n\nThe light remains on regardless of the combinations of objects I have tested, which suggests that there may be multiple blickets or that the machine has a rule that allows it to turn on with any of the objects tested so far.\n\nTo further narrow down the possibilities, I should test combinations of objects to see if the light turns off when certain objects are removed. This will help me identify which objects are necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\nNext, I will take a systematic approach by removing one object at a time from the machine to see if the light turns off. Since I have already removed object 3 without observing a change, I will now take object 4 off the machine to see if the light turns off.\n\n> take object 4 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
