When taken off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 2**: Similar to object 1, placing it on the machine turned the light on, and taking it off turned the light off.

However, I also took it off and the light remained on, which indicates that it might not be a blicket or that it interacts with other objects.\n5. **Object 5**: The light turned on when placed on the machine, but it was also on when I took it off, suggesting it might not be a blicket or that it interacts with other objects.\n6. **Object 6**: The light was on when it was placed on the machine, but I took it off and the light remained on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n7. **Object 7**: When placed on the machine, the light did not turn on, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, I suspect that objects 1, 2, and 3 are blickets. Objects 4, 5, and 6 may have interactions that keep the light on, but I need to further investigate their individual effects. Object 7 is likely not a blicket.\n\nTo confirm my hypothesis, I will take a systematic approach by testing the objects that I suspect are blickets (1, 2, and 3) and see if the machine turns on when they are placed on the machine alone. \n\nI will first test object 1 again to confirm its status as a blicket.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Objects 4, 5, and 6 might not be blickets since the machine remained on when they were removed, suggesting they do not influence the machine's state.
