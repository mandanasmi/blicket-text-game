You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

The same goes for Object 5, as the light turned off when it was removed.\n4. **Object 1 and Object 2**: Both of these objects also consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine, suggesting they are also blickets.\n\nGiven this information, I can infer that the objects that consistently cause the machine to turn on are likely the blickets. \n\nNow, I need to finalize my understanding of which objects are blickets.

When taken off, the light remains on, indicating that at least one other object is contributing to the light being on.\n   - Object 2: When placed on the machine, the light is on. When taken off, the light remains on, indicating that it is not solely responsible for the machine being on.\n   - Object 3: Similar to object 1 and 2, it also keeps the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - Object 4: When placed on the machine, the light is on, but when taken off, the light remains on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5: Similar to object 4, it keeps the light on when placed on the machine, but when taken off, the light is off, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - Object 6: Does not turn the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 7: When placed on the machine, the light is on, but it was previously off when taken off.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 2 was able to turn the machine on when placed on it, but it was also on the machine with other objects that kept the light on. \n   - Since the light remained on when object 2 was taken off, it suggests that object 2 is not a blicket because it does not independently contribute to the machine being on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
