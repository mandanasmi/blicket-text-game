This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Combining Objects**: \n   - After confirming that object 3 activates the machine, I attempted to put object 3 back on the machine while also trying to add other objects. However, I encountered issues with the command syntax, which led to confusion in my attempts to combine objects.\n\n3. **Current Understanding**: \n   - Object 3 is confirmed to be a blicket since it turned the machine on by itself.\n   - Objects 0, 1, and 2 did not activate the machine when tested individually, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I need to confirm that object 3 is indeed the only blicket by testing combinations. Since I have already established that object 3 activates the machine, I will now test it with the other objects to see if they can work together to activate the machine.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now put object 3 back on the machine to confirm its status as a blicket.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
