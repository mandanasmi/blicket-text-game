This indicates that the machine may only accept one object at a time or that the syntax I used was incorrect.\n\n3. **Current Understanding**: \n   - Object 3 is confirmed to be a blicket since it turned the machine on by itself.\n   - Objects 0, 1, and 2 did not activate the machine when tested individually, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I need to confirm that object 3 is indeed the only blicket by testing it with the other objects again, but since I already know that the other objects do not activate the machine, I can conclude that object 3 is the only blicket.\n\n5. **Final Command**: \n   - I will exit the game now, as I have identified object 3 as the blicket and inferred the rule that the machine turns on when a blicket is placed on it.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
