When I placed object 0, object 1, and object 2 on the machine individually, the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n2. When I placed object 3 on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n3. I confirmed that object 3 alone can turn the machine on by removing it and placing it back on the machine, which consistently resulted in the light being on.\n\nFrom this, I can infer that:\n- Object 3 is a blicket.\n- Objects 0, 1, and 2 are not blickets.\n\nNext, I need to explore the relationship further to confirm the rule. Since I have already established that object 3 is a blicket, I can now test combinations of objects to see if the machine responds differently. However, since I have already tested all other objects individually and they did not activate the machine, I can conclude that the rule likely involves the presence of object 3.\n\nTo further confirm this, I will test placing object 3 with one of the other objects (which I suspect are not blickets) to see if the machine still activates. I will choose to put object 3 back on the machine along with one of the other objects (object 0, for example) to see if the machine still turns on.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be:\n> put object 3 on machine and object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - When I placed object 3 on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**: \n   - I attempted to put object 0 on the machine with object 3, but the machine remained on. This suggests that object 3 alone is sufficient to turn the machine on, and object 0 does not affect the outcome.\n   - I confirmed that removing object 3 turned the machine off, and placing it back on turned the machine on again.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the tests, it appears that object 3 is the only object that activates the machine, while objects 0, 1, and 2 do not contribute to the machine's activation.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I should now test object 1 and object 2 in combination with object 3 to see if they have any effect when added to an already active state.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.
