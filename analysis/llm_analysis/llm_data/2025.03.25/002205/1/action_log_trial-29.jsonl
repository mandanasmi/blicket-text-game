This suggests that neither of these objects is a blicket.\n   - When I placed object 2 on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - When I placed object 3 on the machine, the light also turned on, suggesting that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Tests**:\n   - I removed object 2 and the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - I removed object 3 and the light turned off, indicating that object 3 is not a blicket since it did not keep the machine on when alone.\n   - I confirmed that object 2 alone can turn the machine on, while object 3 cannot.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the tests, I can conclude that object 2 is a blicket.

Therefore, I need to further investigate object 3.\n\nTo clarify the rule, it seems that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present.

This suggests that neither of these objects is a blicket.\n   - When I put object 2 on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - When I put object 3 on the machine, the light also turned on, suggesting that object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing**:\n   - I took object 2 off the machine, and the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - I took object 3 off the machine, and the light turned off as well, indicating that object 3 is also a blicket.\n   - I confirmed that the light turns on with object 2 and object 3 on the machine, but it remains off with object 0 and object 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the tests, I can conclude that object 2 and object 3 are blickets.\n   - The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be present on the machine for it to activate.\n\nNow, I need to finalize my understanding of the objects and the rule.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
