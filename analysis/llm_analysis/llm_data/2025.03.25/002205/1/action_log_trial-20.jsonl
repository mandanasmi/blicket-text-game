Based on my interactions so far, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. When I put object 0, object 1, and object 2 on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n2. When I put object 3 on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n3. I also noticed that when I took object 1 off the machine, the light remained on, which further supports the idea that object 1 is not a blicket.\n4. When I took object 3 off the machine, the light turned off, confirming that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n5. The light remained on when I took object 1 off the machine, which means that the presence of object 3 alone is sufficient to keep the machine on.\n\nFrom this, I can conclude that:\n- Object 3 is a blicket.\n- Objects 0, 1, and 2 are not blickets.\n\nNow, I need to confirm that object 3 is the only blicket by testing combinations of objects. Since I have already established that objects 0, 1, and 2 do not activate the machine, I can focus on confirming the rule with object 3.\n\nTo further explore the rule, I will put object 3 back on the machine and observe the light. This will help me confirm that object 3 is indeed the only object that activates the machine.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
