This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - I also observed that when I put object 0 on the machine, the light remained off, which suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - The same goes for objects 2 and 3, as they did not activate the machine when placed on it.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, it seems that object 1 is the only object that activates the machine, indicating it is a blicket. The other objects (0, 2, and 3) do not activate the machine, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to confirm that object 1 is indeed the only blicket by testing it in combination with the other objects again, but since I have already established that the other objects do not activate the machine, I can conclude that object 1 is the only blicket.\n\n5. **Final Command**:\n   - I will now exit the game since I have identified the blicket (object 1) and inferred the rule (the machine turns on only when object 1 is present).\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
