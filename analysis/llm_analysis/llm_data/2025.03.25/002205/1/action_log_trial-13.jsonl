The machine seems to turn on when at least one blicket is placed on it. Since both objects 1 and 2 turned the machine on when placed, it supports the idea that the presence of a blicket is necessary for activation.\n\nTo further confirm my findings, I will conduct one more test by placing object 1 back on the machine to see if it activates the machine again.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

However, when I took it off and put it back on multiple times, the light remained on. This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Object 2**: This object also turned the light on when placed on the machine.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
