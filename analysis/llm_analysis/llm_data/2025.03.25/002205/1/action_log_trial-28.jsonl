I will take object 2 off the machine and then put object 3 back on the machine to see if it activates the machine by itself. This will help me determine if object 3 is a blicket or if it was only the presence of object 2 that activated the machine.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be to take object 2 off the machine and then put object 3 back on the machine to test it.\n\n> take object 2 off the machine; put object 3 on the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

However, I need to test it further to confirm.\n   - Objects 0 and 1 are not blickets since they did not activate the machine.\n\n3. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to isolate object 3 to see if it can turn the machine on by itself. I will take object 2 off the machine and then put object 3 on the machine to see if it activates the machine.\n\n4. **Potential Issues**:\n   - If the machine remains off with object 3 alone, I will confirm that only object 2 is a blicket.
