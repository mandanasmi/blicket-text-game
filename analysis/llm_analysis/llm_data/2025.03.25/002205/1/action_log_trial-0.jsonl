The machine was off.\n   - I removed objects 0 and 2 from the machine, and the machine remained off.\n   - I then placed objects 1 and 3 on the machine, and the machine still remained off.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**: \n   - I attempted various combinations of objects on the machine, but the light remained off in all cases. This suggests that none of the objects I have interacted with so far are blickets, or that the rule for turning on the machine is more complex than just the presence of a single object.\n\n3. **Repeated Attempts**: \n   - I repeatedly tried to put different combinations of objects on the machine, but the light did not turn on. This indicates that I may not have found the right combination or that the machine requires a specific condition to activate.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since none of the combinations I tested turned the machine on, I suspect that either all objects are not blickets, or there is a specific combination or condition that I have not yet discovered. \n   - I need to explore the possibility of testing the objects in pairs or groups to see if a specific combination activates the machine.\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge, I will try putting all four objects on the machine again to see if that changes anything, as I have not yet tested all four together in a single command.\n\n> put object 0 on machine, put object 1 on machine, put object 2 on machine, put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
