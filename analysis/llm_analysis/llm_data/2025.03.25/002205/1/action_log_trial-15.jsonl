When object 2 was on the machine, the light was consistently on regardless of the presence of other objects (including object 3).\n4. When object 3 was taken off the machine, the light remained on, indicating that object 3 does not contribute to the machine turning on.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 3 does not have blicktness, as it did not cause the machine to turn on when it was the only object present. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
