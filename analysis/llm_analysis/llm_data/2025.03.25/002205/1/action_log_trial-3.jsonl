Based on my interactions so far, I have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The machine was off when I started.\n   - Object 1 was on the machine, but the machine was off.\n   - When I took object 1 off, the machine remained off.\n   - I put object 0 and object 2 on the machine, and the machine stayed off.\n   - When I put object 3 on the machine, the machine turned on, indicating that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing**:\n   - I took object 3 off, and the machine turned off again, confirming that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - I then put object 1 back on the machine, and the machine turned on, suggesting that object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - I took object 1 off, and the machine remained on, which is contradictory. This suggests that the machine can be turned on by multiple objects, or that the combination of objects matters.\n\n3. **Current Hypothesis**:\n   - Object 3 is definitely a blicket.\n   - Object 1 might also be a blicket, but I need to confirm this by testing it further with other objects.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I should test object 1 in combination with object 3 to see if the machine remains on or off.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
