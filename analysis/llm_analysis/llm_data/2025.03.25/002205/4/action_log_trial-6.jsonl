When I placed it on the machine, the light turned on, and it turned off when removed. This suggests that object 7 is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was tested but did not turn the machine on when placed on it, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Current Hypothesis**:\n   - Based on the tests, it seems that object 7 is a blicket. The other objects tested (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) do not appear to be blickets.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to confirm that object 7 is indeed a blicket by testing it again in combination with other objects. However, since I have already established that object 7 turns the machine on by itself, I can conclude that it is a blicket.\n\n5. **Rule Inference**:\n   - The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be present on the machine for it to activate. Since object 7 is the only object that has turned the machine on, I can conclude that it is the only blicket identified so far.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will finalize my command to confirm the status of object 7.\n\n> put object 7 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
