Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered:\n\n1. **Objects that turned the machine on**: \n   - Object 4 and object 5 both turned the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 6 also turned the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 7 turned the machine on when placed on it.\n\n2. **Objects that did not turn the machine on**: \n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, and 3 did not turn the machine on when placed on it.\n\n3. **Testing combinations**: \n   - When object 4 was removed, the machine turned off, indicating that it is a blicket.\n   - When object 5 was removed, the machine turned off, indicating that it is also a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was tested alone and turned the machine on, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was tested alone and turned the machine on, indicating it is likely a blicket as well.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since object 7 turned the machine on when placed on it, and there is no evidence to suggest it does not have blicktness, it is reasonable to conclude that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
