When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 7**: When it was on the machine, the light was off.

This suggests that the other objects do not have blicktness.\n6. **Object 1**: I repeatedly tried to put object 1 on the machine, but it did not turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nFrom this, I can conclude that:\n- Object 5 is a blicket.\n- Object 7 is not a blicket.\n- Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are also not blickets.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that it requires at least one blicket (which I have identified as object 5) to be present on it.\n\nGiven this analysis, I am confident that I have identified the blicket and the rule.
