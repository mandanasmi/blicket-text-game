You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that object 6 is likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 7**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on as well, but it was less consistent. The light turned off when I took it off and then turned on again when I put it back on. This suggests that object 7 may also be a blicket, but its behavior seems to be dependent on the presence of object 6.\n\nFrom the tests, it appears that:\n- Object 6 is definitely a blicket.\n- Object 7 may also be a blicket, but its behavior is less straightforward.\n\nTo further confirm the status of object 7, I will conduct a test by placing only object 7 on the machine to see if it activates the machine independently.

This suggests that they are not blickets.\n2. **Object 6**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.

This indicates that object 6 is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 7**: Initially, when placed on the machine, the light turned on.

This suggests that object 6 is sufficient to turn the machine on by itself, while object 7's status is uncertain.\n\n4. **Further Testing**: The repeated actions with object 6 consistently resulted in the light being on when it was placed on the machine, confirming its blicket status.
