Since I have already established that objects 4, 5, and 6 can activate the machine individually, I can test combinations of these objects to see if the machine remains on.\n\nTo further explore this, I will put objects 4, 5, and 6 on the machine together to see if the machine remains on, which would confirm that at least one of them is a blicket and that they can work together.\n\nTherefore, my next command will be:\n\n> put object 4 and object 5 and object 6 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
