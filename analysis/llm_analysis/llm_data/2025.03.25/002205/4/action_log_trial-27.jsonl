However, when I placed object 7 on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Object 7**: I confirmed that object 7 is a blicket by taking it off the machine and then putting it back on, which consistently turned the light on. \n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**: I attempted to put object 0 back on the machine multiple times, but the light remained off, indicating that it is not a blicket. The same goes for objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, as they did not activate the machine when placed on it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the tests, it appears that only object 7 is a blicket.
