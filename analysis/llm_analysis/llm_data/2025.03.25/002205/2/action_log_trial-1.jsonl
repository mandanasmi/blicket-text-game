This suggests that none of the objects I have tested so far are blickets, or that the rule for turning on the machine is more complex than just the presence of a single object.\n\n3. **Potential Issues**: \n   - I have not yet tested combinations of three objects or all four objects together. It's possible that the machine requires a specific combination of objects to turn on, rather than just one or two.\n   - I also need to consider that the machine might require a specific number of blickets to activate, or that it might only activate under certain conditions (e.g., a specific combination of objects).\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I will test the combination of all four objects together on the machine. This will help me determine if the machine requires multiple objects to activate, or if it is indeed the case that none of the objects are blickets.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my next command will be to put all four objects on the machine:\n\n> put object 0 on machine; put object 1 on machine; put object 2 on machine; put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
