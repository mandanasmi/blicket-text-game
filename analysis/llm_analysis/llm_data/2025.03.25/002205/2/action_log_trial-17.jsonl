When I took it off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on when object 2 was also present. However, when I took object 2 off, the light remained off with only object 3 on the machine. This indicates that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n3. **Object 0 and Object 1**: Both did not activate the machine when placed on it, indicating that they are not blickets.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude:\n- Object 2 is a blicket.\n- Object 3 is not a blicket since it did not activate the machine independently.\n- Objects 0 and 1 are also not blickets.\n\nNow, I need to confirm the status of object 3 by testing it again without object 2.
