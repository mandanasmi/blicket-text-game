This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When I placed object 3 on the machine, the light also turned on. This indicates that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n\n3. **Current Hypothesis**:\n   - Based on the interactions, I suspect that object 2 and object 3 are blickets since they both caused the machine to turn on when placed on it.\n   - Object 0 and object 1 are likely not blickets since they did not activate the machine.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - To further confirm my hypothesis, I should test the machine with only one of the suspected blickets (object 2 or object 3) at a time to see if the machine consistently turns on with them alone. This will help me confirm their status as blickets and potentially reveal the rule governing the machine.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will proceed to test object 2 alone on the machine to confirm its status as a blicket.\n\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
