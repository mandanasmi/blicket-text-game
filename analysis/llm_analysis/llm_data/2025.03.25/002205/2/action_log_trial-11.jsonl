This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 and object 3 also resulted in the machine being off, indicating that they might not be blickets since the machine was off when they were removed.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**:\n   - I put object 2 on the machine, and the machine remained off, suggesting that object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - When I put object 1 back on the machine, the machine turned on again, indicating that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n   - Similarly, putting object 3 back on also turned the machine on, suggesting that object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Tests**:\n   - Object 0 is likely a blicket since it was the only object that caused the machine to turn off when removed.\n   - Object 1 and object 3 also seem to be blickets since they turned the machine on when placed back on it.\n   - Object 2 is not a blicket since it did not activate the machine.\n\n4. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - The rule seems to be that at least one of the objects on the machine must be a blicket for the machine to turn on. \n\nBased on this reasoning, I will now test the hypothesis that object 0 is a blicket by putting it back on the machine to see if it turns on.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
