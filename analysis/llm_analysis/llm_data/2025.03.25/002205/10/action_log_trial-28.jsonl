When I removed object 2, the machine turned off, indicating that it might be a blicket. However, when I removed objects 3 and 5, the machine remained off, suggesting that they are not blickets.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**: I then tested various objects by placing them on the machine:\n   - Object 1 and object 4 turned the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 0 also turned the machine on.\n   - Object 6 and object 7 also turned the machine on.\n\n3. **Identifying Non-Blickets**: Since the machine turned off when I removed object 2, it is likely a blicket. Objects 3 and 5 did not affect the machine when removed, indicating they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Current State**: The machine is currently on with objects 1, 4, 6, and 7 on it.
