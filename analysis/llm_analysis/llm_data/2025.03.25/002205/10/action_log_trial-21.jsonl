When I put object 1, object 2, object 3, object 4, object 5, object 6, and object 7 on the machine, the light turned on. However, when I took object 1, object 2, and object 3 off, the light remained on until I removed object 3, which caused the light to turn off.

This indicates that object 4 is not a blicket either.\n\n3. Object 5 and object 6 were also tested, and the light remained on when they were on the machine, but I later removed them and the light turned off. This suggests that at least one of them is a blicket.\n\n4. Object 0 was tested and did not turn the machine on when placed on it, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n5. Object 7 was initially on the machine, but I later found that it did not affect the machine's state when placed back on it.\n\nFrom this analysis, I can conclude that:\n- Objects 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 are likely blickets.\n- Objects 0, 3, and 4 are not blickets.\n\nThe rule for the machine seems to be that it turns on when at least one blicket is present on it.\n\nTo further confirm my findings, I will put object 5 back on the machine to see if the light turns on, as it was previously on when I tested it.\n\n> put object 5 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
