You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

I suspect that objects 3, 4, 5, and 7 are blickets, while 0, 1, 2, and 6 are not.\n\n5. **Next Steps**:\n   - To confirm my hypothesis, I should test combinations of the objects that I suspect are blickets (3, 4, 5, and 7) to see if the machine consistently turns on with them.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now put object 3 back on the machine to confirm that it is indeed a blicket and observe the machine's response.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This suggests that object 6 is not a blicket, as the light turned off when it was removed.\n   - Object 5 was also tested, and the light remained on when it was removed, indicating it could be a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was tested similarly, and the light remained on when it was removed, suggesting it could also be a blicket.\n\n3. **Current Hypothesis**:\n   - Objects 3, 4, 5, and 7 are likely blickets, while objects 0, 1, 2, and 6 are not.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - To confirm my hypothesis, I should test the remaining objects (3, 4, 5, and 7) individually to see if the machine turns off when each is removed.
