Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, let's analyze the information collected:\n\n1. **Initial Tests**: \n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - Objects 5, 6, and 7 were placed on the machine, and the light turned on for all three. This indicates that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects**:\n   - When object 5 was removed, the light remained on. This means that object 5 is not necessary for the machine to be on, suggesting that either object 6 or object 7 must be a blicket.\n   - When object 6 was removed, the light also remained on. This indicates that object 6 is not necessary for the machine to be on, suggesting that object 7 must be a blicket.\n\n3. **Final Test with Object 7**:\n   - When object 7 was removed, the light turned off. This confirms that object 7 is indeed necessary for the machine to be on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, since object 7 is required for the machine to turn on, it must be a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
