Since it was on the machine when the machine was on, I need to test it alone.\n   - I will put object 0 on the machine to see if it turns the machine on.\n\n4. **Potential Issues**:\n   - If object 0 does not turn the machine on, it will confirm that it is not a blicket.

When I took object 6 off the machine, the light turned off, suggesting that object 6 is not a blicket.\n3.

Object 7 also turned the machine on, suggesting it is a blicket as well.\n\nSo far, I have identified:\n- Object 0: likely a blicket (light on when on machine)\n- Object 5: a blicket (light on when on machine)\n- Object 7: a blicket (light on when on machine)\n- Object 6: not a blicket (light off when on machine)\n- Objects 1, 2, 3, 4: not blickets (light off when on machine)\n\nThe remaining objects (0, 5, and 7) consistently keep the light on, while the others do not. \n\nNext, I need to confirm the status of object 0, which I suspect is a blicket.
