This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When I put objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the machine, the light turned on for all of them, indicating that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I took objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 off the machine one by one. The light remained on after removing object 1 and 2, but turned off when I removed object 4 and 5. This indicates that either object 4 or 5 is a blicket, but not both since the light turned off when both were removed.\n   - Object 3 also kept the light on when removed, suggesting it could be a blicket as well.\n   - Object 6 kept the light on when removed, indicating it could also be a blicket.\n   - Object 7 turned the light on when placed on the machine, but I haven't tested it in isolation yet.\n\n3. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - The light seems to turn on with certain combinations of objects.

Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.
