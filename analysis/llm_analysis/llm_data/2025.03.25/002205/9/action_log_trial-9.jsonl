When removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is also likely a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on, but when removed, the light remains on. This indicates that object 2 is not a blicket, as it does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n4. **Objects 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7**: When any of these objects are placed on the machine, the light does not turn on, indicating that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nBased on this information, I can conclude that objects 0 and 1 are blickets, while objects 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are not.\n\nThe rule for the machine appears to be that it turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it.
