However, since I have already identified two blickets, I can conclude that the rule may involve either the presence of one or more specific objects (5 and 7) or a combination of properties that these objects share.\n\nTo further confirm my findings, I will test the combination of object 5 and object 7 together on the machine to see if the machine remains on, which would reinforce the idea that both are blickets.\n\nThus, my final command will be:\n> put object 5 on machine, put object 7 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
