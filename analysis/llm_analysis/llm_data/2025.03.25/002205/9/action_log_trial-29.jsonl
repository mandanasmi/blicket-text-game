However, without further testing to isolate its effect (like removing other objects), we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket.\n\nGiven the information, I will conclude that object 5 is likely a blicket, but there is uncertainty due to the lack of isolation testing.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
