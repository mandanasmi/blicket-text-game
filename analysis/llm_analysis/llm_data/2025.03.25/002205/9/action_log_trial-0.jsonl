This suggests that the machine was still responding positively to other objects that were already on it.\n   - Object 3 was on the machine multiple times, and the light remained on regardless of its presence or absence, indicating that it might also be a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - Objects 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were also placed on the machine, and the light turned on each time, suggesting they could also be blickets.\n   - Object 0 was tested and did not turn the machine on when placed on it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 1 turned the machine on when placed on it, it is likely a blicket. However, the fact that the light remained on when it was taken off suggests that other objects (like object 3) could also be responsible for keeping the machine on.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I conclude that object 1 is indeed a blicket based on the initial test where it activated the machine.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
