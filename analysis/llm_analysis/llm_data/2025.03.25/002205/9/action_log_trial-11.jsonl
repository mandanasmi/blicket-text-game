When I put object 2 back on the machine, the light turned on again, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n3. I then placed object 0, object 1, and object 3 on the machine, and the light remained on for each of these objects. This suggests that at least one of these objects (or possibly all) could also be blickets.\n\nNext, I need to test the remaining objects (4, 5, 6, and 7) to see if they can also turn the machine on. This will help me determine if there are more blickets among them and if there is a specific rule governing the machine's behavior.\n\nTo efficiently explore this, I will start by testing object 4, as it is the next object on the floor. If the machine turns on with object 4, I can conclude that it is also a blicket.
