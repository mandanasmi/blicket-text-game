This suggests that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n   - I also placed object 6 on the machine, and the light remained on, indicating that it might also be a blicket.\n   - I took object 5 off, and the light remained on, which suggests that object 0, 1, 3, 4, and 2 are not blickets since they did not turn the machine on when placed alone.\n\n2. **Further Testing**:\n   - I took object 7 off the machine, and the light remained on, indicating that object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - I confirmed that object 5 and object 6 are likely blickets since the light stayed on when they were removed.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, it seems that the objects that can turn the machine on are likely object 5 and object 6. \n   - The rule for the machine appears to be that it turns on when at least one blicket is present on the machine.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to confirm the status of object 6 by testing it alone on the machine to see if it can turn the machine on by itself.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now execute the command to put object 6 on the machine to confirm its status.\n\n> put object 6 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
