The machine did not turn on with objects 0, 1, or 2, but it did turn on with object 3.\n   - This suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**: \n   - I attempted to put object 3 on the machine with object 0, but the command was invalid. This indicates that I can only place one object at a time on the machine.\n   - I confirmed that when object 3 is on the machine, the light turns on, and when it is taken off, the light turns off.\n\n3. **Further Testing**: \n   - I tried to put objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine again, but the light remained off, confirming that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - The repeated attempts to put object 3 on the machine consistently resulted in the light turning on, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is the only blicket identified so far.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the interactions, I can conclude that object 3 is a blicket. \n   - The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that it activates when object 3 is placed on it, while the other objects do not activate the machine.\n\nNext, I will take the final step to exit the game, as I believe I have identified the blicket and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
