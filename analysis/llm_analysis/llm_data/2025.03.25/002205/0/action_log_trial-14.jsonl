However, the light remained on when either object 2 or object 3 was placed on the machine individually.\n   - When I took object 2 off the machine, the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket. \n   - When I took object 3 off the machine, the light remained on, indicating that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the above interactions, I can conclude that both object 2 and object 3 are blickets. \n   - The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be present on the machine for it to activate.\n\nNow, I will finalize my command to exit the game, as I believe I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
