This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n4. **Reintroducing Object 2**: When object 2 was placed back on the machine, the machine turned on. This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n5. **Testing Object 3**: Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, and the machine turned on each time after it was placed back, but it was also off when alone. This suggests that object 3 may not be a blicket by itself but could be in combination with object 2.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that object 2 is indeed a blicket since it is the only object that consistently turned the machine on when placed on it.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
