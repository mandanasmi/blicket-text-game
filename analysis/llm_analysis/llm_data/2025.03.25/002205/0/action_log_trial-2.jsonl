Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information collected during the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. **Initial Tests**:\n   - When object 0 and object 1 were placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on, suggesting that object 3 could be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Tests**:\n   - Removing object 2 and object 3 from the machine turned the light off, confirming that both objects are necessary for the machine to turn on.\n   - However, when object 3 was placed on the machine again after removing it, the light did not turn on, which is inconsistent with the previous observation that it turned on when object 3 was placed.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 2 is confirmed as a blicket since it consistently turned the machine on when placed.\n   - Object 3's status is ambiguous because it turned the machine on at one point but did not do so consistently in subsequent tests.\n\nGiven the inconsistency with object 3, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket based on the evidence gathered.
