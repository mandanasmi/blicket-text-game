This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nHowever, when both object 2 and object 3 were placed on the machine together, the light did not turn on, which contradicts the previous findings. This inconsistency suggests that the rule for the machine may not be straightforward and could involve a combination of objects or specific conditions.\n\nGiven the evidence, it is unclear if object 3 is definitively a blicket because it was only observed to turn the machine on when it was alone, and the combination with object 2 did not yield a consistent result.\n\nThus, based on the information gathered, I conclude that:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
