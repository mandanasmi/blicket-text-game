You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

When it was taken off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n2. When object 3 was on the machine, the light was off, indicating that it is not a blicket, as it did not activate the machine.\n3. Object 0 and object 2 were also tested on the machine, and the light remained off, suggesting that neither of these objects are blickets either.\n\nSince object 3 was on the machine and did not activate it, it can be concluded that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
