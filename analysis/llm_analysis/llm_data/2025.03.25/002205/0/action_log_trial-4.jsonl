This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - I then tried combinations of objects with object 3, and the machine remained on, indicating that object 3 is likely the cause of the machine turning on.\n\n3. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I attempted to put combinations of objects on the machine, but the machine's state remained unchanged when I included object 3. This reinforces the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - When I took object 3 off the machine, the light turned off, confirming that it is indeed the object that activates the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the interactions, I can conclude that object 3 is a blicket. The other objects (0, 1, and 2) did not activate the machine when placed alone, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n5. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to confirm that object 3 is the only blicket by testing the other objects again in different combinations, but since I have limited steps, I will focus on confirming the status of object 3.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now execute the command to put object 3 back on the machine to confirm that it activates the machine.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
