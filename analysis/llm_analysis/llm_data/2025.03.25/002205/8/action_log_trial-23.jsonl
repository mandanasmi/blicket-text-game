This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 3 being a blicket.\n   - Object 0 was placed on the machine and the light was on, but we have no information about its state when alone.\n\n3. **Key Findings**:\n   - Object 1 is likely a blicket since removing it turned the machine off.\n   - Object 2 is likely not a blicket since removing it did not turn the machine off.\n   - Object 3's state is ambiguous; it was on the machine when the light was on, but we have not tested it alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we have not tested object 3 alone and it was never the sole object on the machine when the light was on, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket.
