You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on top of the machine, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine based on the actions taken.\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Object 0 is on the machine, and the light is off.\n   - Objects 1, 2, and 3 are on the floor, and the light is off.\n\n2. **Testing Objects**:\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests that object 2 could also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests that object 3 could also be a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 also turns the light off, confirming that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Analysis**:\n   - Object 3 was able to keep the machine on when placed on it, and removing it turned the machine off. This indicates that object 3 has a relationship with the machine that suggests it is a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
