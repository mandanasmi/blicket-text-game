You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered during the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Object 0 is on the machine, and the light is on.\n   - Objects 1, 2, and 3 are on the floor.\n\n2. **Removing Object 0**: \n   - When object 0 is taken off, the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 1**: \n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 2**: \n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Testing Object 3**: \n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket.\n\n6. **Further Testing**: \n   - Object 0, when placed back on the machine, keeps the light on, confirming it is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 and object 3 still keeps the light on, indicating that the machine can be on with just object 0 or object 2.\n\n7. **Final Tests**: \n   - When object 1 is removed, the light turns off, confirming it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is confirmed as a blicket since it can turn the machine on by itself.\n   - Object 3 also turns the machine on when placed, but we have not tested it alone without the presence of other known blickets.\n\nGiven that object 3 can turn the machine on, it is likely a blicket, but we cannot definitively conclude it is a blicket without further testing it alone. However, since it has shown the ability to activate the machine, we can reasonably infer that it is a blicket.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
