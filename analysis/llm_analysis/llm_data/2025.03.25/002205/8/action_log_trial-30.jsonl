This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n   - When I took object 2 off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - The light remained on when I took objects 0, 1, and 3 off the machine, suggesting that at least one of these objects is also a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Object 2**:\n   - I confirmed that object 2 is a blicket since the light turned off when it was removed from the machine.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - The light remained on when I removed objects 0 and 1, indicating that at least one of them is also a blicket.\n   - Object 3 did not affect the light when it was on the machine, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Current Hypothesis**:\n   - I suspect that objects 0 and 1 are both blickets, while object 3 is not.

When I put any of the objects (0, 1, 2, or 3) on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n2. When I took object 2 off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n3. When I took object 0 off the machine, the light remained on, suggesting that object 0 is not a blicket.\n4. The same applies to object 1; when I took it off, the light remained on, indicating it is also not a blicket.\n5. Object 3 was on the machine, and when I took it off, the light remained on, suggesting it is not a blicket either.\n\nFrom this analysis, it appears that object 2 is the only object that consistently correlates with the machine turning on and off. Therefore, I can conclude that object 2 is a blicket.\n\nNow, regarding the rule for the machine turning on, it seems that the presence of object 2 is necessary for the machine to turn on, while the other objects do not affect the machine's state when they are present alone.\n\nIn summary:\n- Object 2 is a blicket.\n- The rule for the machine turning on is that it requires object 2 to be present.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now exit the task as I believe I have identified the blicket and the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
