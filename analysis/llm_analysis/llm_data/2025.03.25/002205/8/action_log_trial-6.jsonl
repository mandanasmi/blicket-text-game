This suggests that the machine may not recognize combinations of objects or that there is a specific rule governing how many or which objects can be on the machine at the same time.\n\n3. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - The machine turned on with each individual object, but when I tried to put multiple objects on the machine, it did not turn on consistently. This inconsistency suggests that there may be a limit to how many objects can be on the machine at once or that only certain combinations of objects can activate the machine.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to isolate the objects further to determine if they are indeed blickets. I will put each object on the machine one at a time again to confirm their individual effects on the machine.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will put object 1 on the machine again to see if it activates the machine by itself, confirming its status as a blicket.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 2 and object 3 also turned the light on when placed on the machine, indicating they might also be blickets.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - I attempted to put multiple objects on the machine at once, but the machine only recognized one object at a time in those commands. This suggests that the machine may only need one blicket to turn on, or that it has a specific rule about how many objects can be recognized at once.\n   - I noticed that when I put object 1 on the machine and then took it off, the light turned off, confirming its blicket status. However, when I put object 1 back on the machine with other objects, the light remained on, indicating that at least one of the other objects is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - The machine seems to turn on when at least one blicket is present. Since all objects I tested (0, 1, 2, and 3) turned the machine on when placed on it, I suspect that all four objects are blickets.\n\n4. **Final Decision**:\n   - I will now summarize my findings: I believe that all four objects (0, 1, 2, and 3) are blickets, and the rule for the machine is that it turns on when at least one blicket is present.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will finalize my command to exit the game, as I believe I have identified the blickets and the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
