You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that the machine is still responding to either object 2 or object 3.\n6. When object 2 was taken off the machine, the light remained on. This indicates that object 3 must be a blicket since it is the only object left on the machine.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket because the machine remained on when both objects 1 and 2 were removed, indicating that object 3 must be contributing to the machine's activation.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
