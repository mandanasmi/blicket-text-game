However, when I took it off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n2. **Object 1**: Similar to object 0, placing it on the machine turned the light on, and removing it turned the light off. This also suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light remained off. This indicates that object 2 is not a blicket.\n4. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on.

The pattern suggests that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it.
