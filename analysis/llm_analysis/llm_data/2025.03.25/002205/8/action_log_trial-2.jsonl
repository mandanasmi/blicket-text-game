You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Initially, the machine was on with object 1 on it.\n2. When object 1 was removed, the machine turned off.\n3. When object 0 was placed on the machine, it turned on.\n4. When object 2 was placed on the machine, it also turned on.\n5. Removing both object 0 and object 2 turned the machine off.\n6. When object 3 was placed on the machine, it did not turn on.\n7. Placing object 1 back on the machine turned it on again.\n8. Placing object 0 on the machine again also turned it on.\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- Object 1 must have some property that contributes to the machine turning on, as it was the only object that consistently turned the machine on when placed on it after being removed.\n- Object 0 and object 2 also turned the machine on, but object 3 did not.\n\nSince the machine turned off when object 1 was removed and turned back on when it was placed again, it indicates that object 1 has a relationship with the machine that is not independent.
