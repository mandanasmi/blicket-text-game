This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing**:\n   - When object 2 was taken off, the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was taken off, the light turned off, which indicates that object 3 is also likely a blicket since it was previously on the machine and contributed to the light being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 3 was able to turn the machine on when placed on it, and when it was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 3 has a relationship with the machine, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
