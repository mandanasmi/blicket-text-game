Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the information gathered during the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - When any object (0, 1, 2, or 3) was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n   - Removing object 0 or 1 did not turn the light off, indicating that at least one of the other objects (2 or 3) must be responsible for the light being on.\n\n2. **Testing Object 2**:\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. However, when it was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3**:\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light was off. This suggests that object 3 does not activate the machine on its own.\n   - However, when object 3 was removed, the light was still off, indicating that it does not contribute to the machine being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 3 did not turn the machine on when placed alone and did not affect the state of the machine when removed, it does not have the blicktness required to be classified as a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
