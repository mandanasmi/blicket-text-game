When I put object 0 on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. When I put object 1 on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n3. The same was true for object 2 and object 3; the light turned on when either of these objects was placed on the machine. This suggests that both object 2 and object 3 are also likely blickets.\n4. When I removed object 0, the light remained on, indicating that the state of the machine is not dependent on object 0.\n5. Removing objects 1, 2, or 3 did not turn off the machine, which suggests that at least one of the remaining objects (1, 2, or 3) is sufficient to keep the machine on.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude:\n- Object 0 is not a blicket.\n- Objects 1, 2, and 3 are likely blickets.\n\nNext, I need to determine the rule for how the machine turns on. Since the machine remained on regardless of the combinations of objects 1, 2, and 3, it suggests that the machine may turn on with any of these objects present. \n\nTo further confirm my findings, I will conduct a test by removing all objects from the machine and then adding them back one by one to see if the machine turns on with each object. This will help me confirm the blicket status of each object and potentially clarify the rule.\n\nI will now execute the command to remove all objects from the machine to test them individually.\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
