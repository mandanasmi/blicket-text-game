You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

This suggests that neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Tests**:\n   - When object 2 was removed from the machine, the light remained on. This indicates that object 3 must also have some influence on the machine, suggesting it could be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was removed from the machine, the light turned off. This confirms that object 3 is indeed contributing to the machine being on.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 3 was able to turn the machine on when placed on it and the machine turned off when it was removed, it indicates that object 3 has blicktness. \n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
