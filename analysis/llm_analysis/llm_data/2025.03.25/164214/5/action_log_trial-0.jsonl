That means either object 0 isn't a blicket, or the rule requires more than one object. Wait, maybe the rule isn't just having a blicket on the machine. Maybe it's a specific combination or a certain number. Let's try another object alone.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if putting another object on the machine with object 0 will turn it on. But let's first test each object one by one. So next, I'll take object 0 off and try object 1. Wait, but maybe the machine's state updates after each action. Let me think: after putting object 0 on, the machine is still off. So maybe object 0 isn't a blicket. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when all blickets are on it. But since there are four objects, maybe it's a subset.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is on it, or if an even number, etc. But without more info, I need to test systematically.\n\nNext step: put object 1 on the machine along with object 0. Let's see if combining two objects works. If the machine turns on, then maybe one of them is a blicket. If not, maybe neither, or a different combination is needed.\n\nWait, but maybe I should first check each object alone. So after putting object 0 on and it didn't work, maybe try object 1 alone. So I should take object 0 off first. Let me do that.\n\nWait, the current state is object 0 is on the machine. The light is off. So first, take object 0 off. Then put object 1 on the machine. Let's see if that does anything. If the machine turns on when object 1 is on, then object 1 is a blicket. If not, maybe not.

Let's start by testing each object one by one. So next, take object 0 off the machine, then put object 1 on. Then check if the machine turns on. If not, try object 2, then 3.

Let's start by recalling the information given. All objects are initially on the floor. The machine's light is off. The user tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then they took it off, still no change.\n\nHmm, maybe putting a single object isn't enough. The rule might require multiple objects on the machine. Let me test that. Let's try putting two objects on the machine and see if the light turns on. For example, put object 0 and object 1 on the machine. But wait, the commands are one at a time. So I need to do them step by step.\n\nFirst, put object 0 on the machine. The light is still off. Then put object 1 on the machine. If the light turns on, then maybe the combination of 0 and 1 is required. But if not, maybe other combinations. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when any blicket is present, but only if certain conditions are met. Or maybe it's a specific number of blickets.\n\nWait, the definition says a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So if an object's presence on the machine affects the machine's state (on/off), then it's a blicket. So I need to test each object individually and in combinations to see their effect.\n\nIn the first attempt, putting object 0 alone didn't turn it on. So maybe object 0 isn't a blicket, or the rule requires more than one. Let's try another object. Maybe put object 1 on the machine next. If after putting object 1 on, the light turns on, then either 1 is a blicket, or 0 and 1 together are needed. But since when 0 was alone, it didn't work, maybe 1 is the blicket. Let's try that.\n\nWait, but when the user put object 0 on and then took it off, the light stayed off. So maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine now. Let's see:\n\nPut object 1 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. Then try combining with others.

Since the user already tried object 0 and it didn't work, next try object 1. Then 2, then 3. If none turn the machine on when alone, then the rule must involve combinations.\n\nWait, but the user has limited steps (32). So maybe a more efficient approach is to test combinations first. For example, put two objects on and see. If the light turns on, then at least one of them is a blicket, but which one? Then remove one at a time to check.\n\nAlternatively, if the machine is off when all objects are off, then putting some combination turns it on. Let's try putting 0 and 1 first. But each step is a single action. So first put 0 on, then put 1 on, then check. Let's do that step by step.\n\nSo in the current state, after the user took object 0 off, all objects are on the floor. Next command should be putting object 1 on the machine. Let's do that."}

So neither object 0 nor 1 alone activates the machine. Maybe the rule requires more than one object?

Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are placed, or any number greater than one. Alternatively, maybe the rule is an XOR-type where certain combinations activate it.\n\nBut let's test systematically. Let's try putting two objects on the machine. Since 0 and 1 didn't work individually, maybe combining them. Let's try putting both 0 and 1 on the machine next. If the machine turns on, then maybe both are blickets and the rule is that all blickets must be present. Or maybe at least one.

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and what rule makes the machine turn on. The machine's light is off right now, and all objects are on the floor initially. \n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then taking it off didn't change anything. Then I tried putting object 1 on, but still nothing. Then added 2 and 3, making all four on the machine, but the light is still off. Hmm. Maybe putting them all on isn't the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe the rule isn't about the number of objects but something else. Maybe the presence of certain objects. But since putting each one individually didn't work, perhaps the rule requires a combination. Let me think. When I put 0 alone, nothing. Then 1 alone, nothing. Then 2 and 3. Maybe combinations of two? Let me try that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires a specific configuration, like certain objects being on together. Since putting all four didn't work, maybe it's a subset. Let me start by testing pairs. For example, put 0 and 1 on the machine. If that doesn't work, try 0 and 2, etc. If the light turns on with a particular pair, those might be the blickets. Or maybe it's a single object, but requires another to be off. Wait, but when I tried each alone, it didn't work. So maybe the rule is that exactly two specific objects need to be on the machine. Or maybe all except one. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets. Or maybe it's an AND condition where all blickets must be present. But since putting all four didn't work, maybe the blickets are a subset that's not all of them. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But in that case, when I put each object on alone, the light should have turned on if any of them were blickets. But it didn't. So that can't be the case. So the rule is more complex.\n\nWait, maybe it's an XOR situation. Like, if exactly one of two specific objects is on. Or maybe the presence of a certain combination, like object 1 and 2 together. Let me try some combinations. Since all four on didn't work, maybe trying subsets. Let's try putting objects 0 and 1 on. If that doesn't work, then try 0 and 2, etc.\n\nWait, but the user has limited steps. Let me plan efficiently. Let's try putting objects 0 and 1 on the machine. If that doesn't work, take one off and add another. For example:\n\nCurrent state: all four objects are on the machine, light is off. So maybe having all of them on isn't the solution. Let me take some off. Let's take off objects 3 and 2, leaving 1 and 0. Wait, but the light was off when only 0 was on, then 1 was added. Then 2 and 3. So maybe even with 0 and 1, it's still off. Let me check.\n\nWait, the steps so far were: put 0 on (light off), take 0 off, put 1 on (light off), then put 2, then 3. So after putting 1, then adding 2 and 3, the light is still off. So maybe none of them are blickets? But that can't be. The problem states that some are blickets. So perhaps the rule requires a specific combination. Alternatively, maybe the machine only turns on when a certain number of blickets are present, but not all. For example, exactly two blickets need to be on. Let's suppose objects 1 and 2 are blickets. If I put both on, the machine should turn on. But in previous steps, when I put 1, 2, 3 on, maybe that included 1 and 2. Wait, after putting 1 on, then 2, then 3. So after adding 2, the machine had 1 and 2 on, but light was still off. Then adding 3 made no change. So that suggests that 1 and 2 together don't activate it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on. If there are two blickets, say 2 and 3, then putting both would activate it. But in the previous steps, when 2 and 3 were added along with 1 and 0, it didn't. Wait, but maybe there are three blickets. For example, 1,2,3. Then putting all three would activate it. But when I put 1, then 2, then 3, each step the light remained off. Wait, but maybe the order matters. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I put object 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2, still off. Then adding 3, still off. Then adding 0 (but wait, in the previous steps, after putting 0 on, then taking it off, then putting 1, 2, 3. So all four were on? Wait, no. Let me recount the steps:\n\n1. put 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n2. take 0 off.\n3. put 1 on \u2192 light off.\n4. put 2 on \u2192 light off.\n5. put 3 on \u2192 light off.\n\nSo after step 5, all four objects are on the machine? Wait, no. Because step 1: put 0 on machine (machine has 0). Then take 0 off (machine empty). Then put 1 on (machine has 1). Then put 2 on (machine has 1 and 2). Then put 3 on (machine has 1, 2, 3). So the machine has three objects: 1,2,3. Object 0 is on the floor. So the machine has three objects. Then the light is still off. So maybe the rule requires all blickets to be on the machine. If the blickets are 0, then even if it's not on the machine, but others are, the machine stays off. But that's possible. Let's test that.\n\nWait, in the first step, putting 0 on the machine alone didn't activate it. So if 0 is a blicket, then the rule might require another condition. Maybe the machine only activates if at least one blicket is present and some other condition. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. Let's test putting 0 and 1 on the machine. Wait, but in previous steps, when I put 0 on, then took it off, then put 1 on, but when I put 2 and 3, but maybe the combination of 0 and 1 is needed. Let me try that.\n\nWait, currently, the machine has objects 1,2,3 on it. The light is off. So perhaps I need to take some off and try combinations. Let's try taking off 2 and 3, leaving 1 on. Then add 0. So the machine would have 0 and 1. Let's see.\n\nBut to do that, the commands would be:\n\ntake object 1 off the machine \u2192 no, wait, currently the machine has 1,2,3. So first, take 3 off, then take 2 off, then take 1 off. Then put 0 and 1 on. But that's several steps. Let me think of the most efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blickets are objects 2 and 3. Let's try putting them on together. Wait, but they are already on the machine. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when a certain object is NOT on. For example, if object 0 is a blicket, the machine activates when it's off. But that seems unlikely. The problem says blicketness makes the machine turn on. So presence of blickets should contribute to activation.\n\nAnother angle: mutual information. A blicket is an object whose presence affects the machine's state. So if the machine's state (on/off) depends on the blicket's presence. So to test if an object is a blicket, we need to check if changing its presence (on or off the machine) changes the probability of the machine being on, given other objects' states.\n\nSo, for example, if object 0 is a blicket, then adding it to the machine when others are in a certain state should make the machine turn on. But when I added it alone, the machine didn't turn on. So maybe it's only a blicket in combination with others.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's approach systematically. Let's test individual objects first. For each object, put it on the machine alone and see if the machine turns on. If not, then the object might not be a blicket, or the rule requires more than one.\n\nIn previous steps, when I put object 0 on alone \u2192 machine off. Then 1 alone \u2192 off. Then 2 and 3 added \u2192 still off. So individual objects don't activate the machine. So the rule must require a combination.\n\nLet me try putting objects 0 and 1 on together. So take off 2 and 3 (if they are currently on the machine). Wait, right now, the machine has 1,2,3. So I need to take them off.\n\nSo first, take 3 off. Then take 2 off. Then take 1 off. Then put 0 and 1 on.\n\nBut that would take multiple steps. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state: objects 1,2,3 are on the machine. Light is off.\n\nSo commands needed:\n\n> take object 3 off the machine\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 2 off the machine\n\nThen:\n\n> take object 1 off the machine\n\nNow machine is empty. Then:\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n\nCheck if light turns on.\n\nBut this uses 4 steps. Maybe I should try combining objects 0 and 1 first. Alternatively, maybe try adding object 0 to the current setup. Let's see:\n\nCurrent machine has 1,2,3. So adding object 0 would make all four. But when all four are on, maybe the machine turns on. Wait, but earlier, when I put all four on (after step 5), the light was off. Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, in the initial steps, after putting 0 on, took it off. Then put 1 on, then 2, then 3. So machine has 1,2,3. Then the user added object 3 again? Wait, no. The commands were:\n\nput object 0 on the machine \u2192 machine has 0.\n\ntake object 0 off \u2192 machine empty.\n\nput object 1 on \u2192 machine has 1.\n\nput object 2 on \u2192 machine has 1 and 2.\n\nput object 3 on \u2192 machine has 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo the machine has three objects. Then the light is off. So adding 0 to the machine now would make four. Let's try that.\n\nSo command: put object 0 on the machine. Now all four are on. If the machine turns on, then the rule might require all four. But in that case, they would all be blickets. But the problem states some are blickets, not necessarily all. Alternatively, the rule might be that all blickets must be present, and if there are four blickets, then all must be on. But since the light is off when all are on, that can't be. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when exactly two objects are on, and those two are the blickets. But I need to test combinations.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates if the number of blickets on the machine is odd. So if there are two blickets, putting one would activate, but putting both would deactivate. But without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates only if a single specific object is on. But when I tested each individually, none worked. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's think of possible rules. For example:\n\n- Machine activates if at least one blicket is present. But when I put each object alone, none worked. So this can't be.\n\n- Machine activates if all blickets are present. If there are two blickets, putting both would activate. If three, etc.\n\n- Machine activates if exactly one blicket is present. But again, testing individually didn't work.\n\n- Machine activates if more than one blicket is present. So need at least two.\n\nBut how to determine which combination. Let's try putting objects 0 and 1 on the machine. If that doesn't work, try 0 and 2, etc.\n\nBut given the step limit, I need to be efficient. Let's try putting 0 and 1 on first.\n\nTo do that, I need to clear the machine first. The current machine has 1,2,3. So I need to take them off.\n\nSo steps:\n\ntake object 3 off.\n\ntake object 2 off.\n\ntake object 1 off.\n\nNow machine is empty.\n\nput object 0 on.\n\nput object 1 on.\n\nCheck if light is on.\n\nBut that's four steps. Let's see:\n\nAfter taking 3 off: machine has 1 and 2.\n\nTake 2 off: machine has 1.\n\nTake 1 off: machine empty.\n\nPut 0 on: machine has 0. Light off.\n\nPut 1 on: machine has 0 and 1. Light off.\n\nSo that didn't work. Then try 0 and 2.\n\nTake 1 off. Put 2 on. Machine has 0 and 2. Light off.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe try 0 and 3.\n\nTake 2 off. Put 3 on. Machine has 0 and 3. Light off.\n\nStill no. Then maybe 1 and 2.\n\nTake 0 and 3 off. Put 1 and 2 on. Light off.\n\nHmm. This is time-consuming. Maybe try a different approach. Let's try putting two objects that haven't been tested together yet. For example, objects 2 and 3.\n\nCurrently, the machine has 1,2,3. Let's take 1 off. Now machine has 2 and 3. Light remains off. So 2 and 3 together don't activate. Then take 2 off, leaving 3 alone. Light off. So 3 alone doesn't work. Take 3 off. Put 2 on. Light off. So 2 alone doesn't work.\n\nWhat if the rule requires three blickets? For example, 1,2,3. Then putting all three would activate. But when they were on the machine (with 1,2,3), light was off. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two specific objects are on. For example, 1 and 3. Let's test that. Put 1 and 3 on the machine. So, current machine is empty. Put 1 on, then 3 on. Light remains off. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when an object is placed on the floor. Like, if a blicket is on the floor, the machine activates. But that contradicts the idea that blicketness makes the machine turn on when on the machine. So probably not.\n\nAnother possibility: The machine activates when the total weight of blickets is a certain value. But without knowing weights, this is hard to test.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is based on the order in which objects are placed. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, what if the machine activates when a blicket is removed. For example, if a blicket is taken off the machine. But when I took object 0 off, the light didn't come on. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires a specific sequence of placing and removing. But I think the rule is based on the current state, not past actions.\n\nAnother approach: mutual information. To determine if an object is a blicket, we need to see if the machine's state changes when the object's state changes, holding other objects constant.\n\nFor example, take two scenarios where only the presence of object X differs. If the machine's state is different, then X is a blicket.\n\nSo let's test object 0. Let's create a scenario where only object 0 is added, with others fixed.\n\nCurrently, machine has 1,2,3. Light is off. Let's add object 0. Now all four are on. If the light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe not. Let's try.\n\nCommand: put object 0 on the machine. Now all four are on. If the light turns on, then 0 is a blicket. But since in previous steps, when 0 was alone, the light was off, but in combination with others, maybe it's required. Let's see.\n\nAfter putting 0 on, the machine has all four. If the light turns on, then the rule might be that all objects must be on. But earlier, when the user put all four on, the light was off. Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, initially, all objects are on the floor. The user put 0 on, then took it off. Then put 1,2,3 on. Then in the last command, put 3 on again? No, the steps were:\n\n1. put object 0 \u2192 machine has 0. Light off.\n\n2. take 0 off \u2192 machine empty.\n\n3. put 1 \u2192 machine has 1. Light off.\n\n4. put 2 \u2192 machine has 1 and 2. Light off.\n\n5. put 3 \u2192 machine has 1,2,3. Light off.\n\nThen the user is now thinking. So the current state is machine has 1,2,3. Light is off.\n\nSo the next step could be to add object 0 to the machine. Let's try that.\n\nCommand: put object 0 on the machine. Now all four objects are on the machine. If the light turns on, then the rule is all four must be present. But if that's the case, then all four are blickets. But when 0 was alone, it didn't activate. So maybe the rule is that all must be present. But the problem states that some are blickets, not necessarily all. So this is possible. But in this case, putting all four on would activate the machine.\n\nSo after putting object 0 on the machine (now all four are on), check if the light turns on. If yes, then the rule is all four must be on. If not, then another rule.\n\nSo the next command should be: put object 0 on the machine."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, when I put objects 1, 2, 3 on the machine one by one, the light stayed off. Then when I added object 0, the light turned on. That suggests that object 0 is a blicket, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nWait, let me recap the steps. Initially, all objects are on the floor. First, I tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then I took it off. Then I put 1, 2, 3 on the machine one after another, but the light was still off. Finally, adding object 0 again made the light turn on. So maybe the machine requires object 0 to be present, but only in combination with others? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all four objects are on it. But when I added object 0 the second time, that was the fourth object. Wait, no: the first time I put 0 on alone, then took it off. Then I added 1, 2, 3 (so three objects), then added 0 again, making four total. Then the light turned on. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires all four objects to be on it. But that might not make sense because in the first attempt, putting 0 alone didn't trigger it. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket, but only object 0 is a blicket, but when it's placed alone, it's not enough. Hmm, but when I put 0 on the machine the first time, alone, the light was off. Then when all four were on, it turned on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. But if object 0 is the only blicket, then putting it on alone should turn the machine on. But that didn't happen. So maybe the rule is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets to be on. Let me think.\n\nWait, when I put object 0 on the machine the first time, the light was off. Then after adding 1,2,3, then adding 0 again (so 1,2,3,0 on the machine), the light turned on. So maybe the presence of object 0 in combination with others is necessary. Or perhaps the machine requires all objects except one to be on it. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the machine activates when a specific combination is present. For example, object 0 plus any other. But when I put 0 and 1 on the machine, would that trigger it? Wait, in the previous steps, after putting 1,2,3 on, then adding 0, the light turned on. So the total objects on the machine were 1,2,3,0. But perhaps the rule is that object 0 is a blicket and at least one other object is also a blicket. But then, maybe object 3 is also a blicket. Wait, but when I had 1,2,3 on the machine, the light was off. Adding 0 made it turn on. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the machine requires at least two blickets. But in that case, maybe object 0 and another (like 3) are blickets. But when I put 0 and 3 on the machine, would that turn it on? I need to test that. But I haven't tried that combination yet. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. Suppose there are two blickets: 0 and 3. So when all four are on, including 0 and 3, the machine turns on. But when I had 1,2,3 on, the light was off. Then adding 0 (which is a blicket) would make the machine turn on. But if 3 is a blicket, then when 3 is on the machine alone, the machine should turn on. But when I put 3 on the machine alone earlier, the light stayed off. So that can't be. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the exact sequence again. The initial state: all objects on the floor. Then:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Take 0 off.\n3. Put 1 on machine: light off.\n4. Put 2 on machine: light off.\n5. Put 3 on machine: light off.\n6. Put 0 on machine: light on.\n\nSo after step 6, objects 1,2,3,0 are all on the machine. The light turns on. So perhaps the rule is that all objects must be on the machine. But then, when all four are on, it turns on. Let me check that. If that's the case, then all four are required. But maybe not. Let's test that. For example, take one object off and see if the light turns off. But I need to do that. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires the presence of object 0 and any other object. Let's see: when object 0 is on the machine alone, light off. But when object 0 is with others, light on. So maybe the rule is that object 0 must be present along with at least one other object. Let's test that hypothesis. If I put 0 and 1 on the machine, does the light turn on? Let's try that. But in the current state, all four objects are on the machine. The light is on. If I take objects 2 and 3 off, leaving 0 and 1, does the light stay on? Let's try that. If the light stays on, then the rule might be that 0 and at least one other are present. If the light turns off, then maybe all four are needed. So I need to test that. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. But which ones? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's rule is that the number of blickets on it must be odd. But that's more complicated. Let's start with simpler hypotheses.\n\nIn the current state, all four objects are on the machine and the light is on. Let's try removing one by one to see when the light turns off. For example, take object 3 off. If the light remains on, then 3 is not a blicket. If it turns off, then 3 is a blicket. Similarly for others.\n\nSo next steps: take object 3 off the machine. If the light stays on, then 3 is not a blicket, and the combination is still valid. If it turns off, then 3 is part of the required set.\n\nAlternatively, since putting 0 on the machine when others are already there made the light turn on, perhaps 0 is a blicket and the others are not. But why did the light not turn on when 0 was alone? Maybe the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets. So if 0 is the only blicket, then even when it's on, the machine doesn't activate. But that contradicts the idea. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on it, and there's only one blicket (0), but the machine also requires that at least two objects are present. Wait, but when 0 is alone, it's not enough. When 0 is present with others, it works. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is on it along with any other object. So object 0 is a blicket, and the presence of another object (regardless of whether it's a blicket) is required. That would explain why putting 0 alone doesn't work, but adding others does. Let's test this.\n\nIn the current state, all four are on the machine. Light is on. Let's take object 3 off. Now, objects 0,1,2 are on the machine. If the light stays on, then the presence of 0 and any others (even 1 or 2) is sufficient. If the light turns off, then maybe all three (0,1,2,3) are needed. Alternatively, if removing 3 makes the light stay on, but removing another object (like 1) also keeps it on, then the rule could be that object 0 must be present along with at least one other. So let's proceed with taking 3 off.\n\n> take object 3 off the machine\n\nAfter taking object 3 off, if the light remains on, that suggests that object 3 isn't necessary. Then, maybe the rule is that object 0 and at least one other are present. If the light turns off, then 3 was necessary. But since the light was on when all four were present, but when 3 is removed, maybe the light stays on if the rule is that 0 is required with any other. Let's check."}

But that's a bit odd. Wait, no. Let me recount the steps:\n\nInitially, all objects are on the floor. Then:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine \u2192 off.\n2. Take 0 off \u2192 off.\n3. Put 1 on \u2192 off.\n4. Put 2 on \u2192 off.\n5. Put 3 on \u2192 off. Now all four are on the machine? Wait, no. Wait, after putting 3 on, the machine had 1,2,3 on it? Wait, no. Let me check the sequence again.\n\nWait, the steps were:\n\n- Put 0 on \u2192 off.\n- Take 0 off \u2192 off.\n- Put 1 on \u2192 off.\n- Put 2 on \u2192 off.\n- Put 3 on \u2192 off. So now, objects 1,2,3 are on the machine. Then put 0 on \u2192 now all four (0,1,2,3) are on the machine, and the light turns on. Then take 3 off \u2192 remaining objects 0,1,2 on the machine, light turns off.\n\nSo the machine turned on when all four were on. But when I removed 3, it went off. That suggests that all four need to be present. But that would mean all four are blickets. But maybe that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But when I put each object individually, none worked except when all were together. Wait, but when I put 0 alone first, it didn't work. Then when all four were on, it did. So that suggests that the rule might be that all blickets need to be on the machine. If all four are blickets, then that's the case. But maybe the blickets are a subset, and the machine requires all of them to be present. For example, if 0 is a blicket and others aren't, but putting 0 alone didn't work. Wait, that can't be. Because when I put 0 alone, machine didn't turn on. Then when all four were on, it did. But if 0 is a blicket, maybe the rule is that all blickets must be present. So if 0 is the only blicket, then putting it on should activate the machine. But in the first step, putting 0 on didn't activate. Hmm. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly two blickets are present. But that doesn't fit here. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires a specific combination. Let's think again.\n\nWait, when I put 0 on the machine alone (step 1), light stayed off. Then after putting 1,2,3 on (steps 3-5), each time the light stayed off. Then adding 0 again (step 6) to the machine (now 0,1,2,3 are on) made the light turn on. Then removing 3 (step 7) caused the light to turn off. So the presence of all four objects on the machine made it turn on. So perhaps the rule is that all objects must be on the machine. But that would mean all are blickets. But the definition says a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. If the machine only turns on when all are present, then each object's presence is dependent on the machine's state. Because if any one is missing, the machine turns off. So each object's presence is necessary for the machine to be on. Therefore, all four are blickets. But that seems a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are present, but that doesn't fit here. Alternatively, maybe the machine turns on when a specific subset is present. Let's see: when I had 0,1,2,3 all on, the machine turned on. When 3 was removed, leaving 0,1,2 on, it turned off. So the presence of 0,1,2,3 is required. So the rule is that all four must be on the machine. Therefore, all four are blickets. But wait, when I put 0 on the machine alone, the light was off. But according to the rule, if all four are required, then putting any subset would not turn it on. But when all four are on, it turns on. Therefore, each object's presence is necessary, hence all are blickets. Because the machine's state (on) is dependent on all of them being present. Therefore, each object's presence is a necessary condition for the machine to be on. So mutual information between each object's presence and the machine's state is non-zero. Hence, all four are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if all four objects are on it. But let me test this hypothesis. For example, if I put all four on again, the machine should turn on. Then remove one, it turns off. That seems to fit. But let's check: in the current state, after step 7, objects 0,1,2 are on the machine, and 3 is off. Machine is off. So if I put 3 back on, making all four on again, the machine should turn on. Then removing any one should turn it off. Let me try that. But I need to proceed with the next command. So the next step is to put 3 back on the machine. Let's see what happens. If the machine turns on again, that confirms the rule. So the command would be 'put object 3 on the machine'. Let's see if that works."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, here's what I observed:\n\nInitially, all objects are on the floor. The machine is off. \n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine alone, nothing happened. Then I took it off. Then I tried putting objects 1, 2, and 3 on the machine one by one, but the machine stayed off. Then when I added object 0 back to the machine (so objects 0,1,2,3 are all on it), the machine turned on. Then when I removed object 3, the machine turned off again. Then putting object 3 back made it turn on again.\n\nWait, let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Take 0 off.\n3. Put 1 on: light off.\n4. Put 2 on: still off.\n5. Put 3 on: still off.\n6. Put 0 on again (now all four are on): light turns on.\n7. Remove 3: light off.\n8. Put 3 back: light on.\n\nSo, when all four objects are on the machine, the light is on. But when 3 is removed (leaving 0,1,2 on), it turns off. Then adding 3 back makes it on again. Wait, but in step 6, after adding 0, all four are on, so maybe the rule requires all four to be present. But when 3 is removed, it's off. Then adding 3 back (so all four again) turns it on. That suggests that the machine requires all four objects to be on it. But wait, in the first case, when 0 was alone, it didn't turn on. Then when all four are present, it did. Then removing any one (like 3) turns it off. Then adding that one back turns it on. So maybe the rule is that all objects must be on the machine. But there are four objects here. Wait, but maybe not all, but some specific combination. Let's see: when 0 is added again (step 6), the machine turns on. At that point, objects 0,1,2,3 are all on. Then taking 3 off (step7) leaves 0,1,2 on, machine off. Then adding 3 back (step8) turns it on. So that suggests that the machine turns on only when all four are present. But then why did step 6 turn it on when all four were added? Let me check the steps again:\n\nWait, in step 5: after putting 3 on the machine (so 1,2,3 are on), then step 6 is putting 0 on, making all four on. Then the light turns on. Then step7: remove 3, leaving 0,1,2 on, light off. Step8: adding 3 back (so all four again) light on. So that seems to indicate that the machine requires all four objects to be on it. But that would mean all four are blickets because their presence affects the machine's state. But the problem states that some of the objects are blickets, not necessarily all. So maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But how many are blickets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But in the initial steps, when 0 was alone, it didn't turn on. But then when 0 is added again with others, it does. Wait, maybe 0 is a blicket but requires another one? Like the machine turns on if two or more blickets are present. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the steps:\n\n- When 0 is alone: no activation.\n- When 1,2,3 are added (without 0): no activation.\n- Adding 0 to 1,2,3: activation.\n- Removing 3 (now 0,1,2): no activation.\n- Adding 3 again: activation.\n\nSo the activation happens when all four are present. But if that's the case, all four would be blickets. But maybe the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. If all four are blickets, then that's the case. But perhaps there's another rule. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets. But in the case where all four are on, if they are all blickets, that's even. But when 3 is removed, three blickets would be present, which is odd. But the machine is off then. Hmm, maybe that's possible. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. But how does that fit with the observations?\n\nWait, when 0 is alone: off. If 0 is a blicket, then one blicket is present: off. If the rule is two or more, then adding another would turn it on. But when 0 is added to 1,2,3 (which were already on the machine), then the machine turns on. If 1,2,3 are non-blickets, and 0 is a blicket, then that would mean that only 0 is a blicket. But that doesn't fit because adding 0 alone didn't activate it. So maybe 0 is a blicket but requires another one. Like the machine needs at least two blickets. Then, perhaps objects 0 and 3 are blickets. Let's see:\n\n- When 0 is alone: one blicket (0) \u2192 off.\n- Adding 1,2,3 (non-blickets): machine remains off.\n- Adding 0 again (now 0,1,2,3 on): if 0 and 3 are blickets, that's two \u2192 on.\n- Remove 3: now only 0 is a blicket \u2192 off.\n- Add 3 again: two blickets \u2192 on.\n\nThis fits. So the rule might be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are on it. And the blickets are 0 and 3. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nBut wait, when 0 was added with 1,2,3 (assuming 1 and 2 are non-blickets), then having 0 and 3 would be two blickets \u2192 machine on. Removing 3 leaves only 0 \u2192 off. Adding 3 again brings it back to two \u2192 on. That fits. But how do we know if 1 or 2 are blickets? Maybe they aren't. Let's check other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly two blickets. But in that case, adding 0 and 3 would turn it on. But if there are other combinations, like 0 and 1, that would also turn it on. But we haven't tested that yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the sum of the blicktness is a certain value. But this seems more complex. Let's stick with the simpler rules.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when a specific pair of blickets is present. For example, 0 and 3 together. Let's see: when both 0 and 3 are on the machine, it's on. If either is missing, it's off. But in the earlier steps, when 0 was alone, it's off. When 3 was added with 1 and 2 (without 0), it's off. When 0 is added (so 0,1,2,3), it's on. Removing 3 (leaving 0,1,2) \u2192 off. Adding 3 back \u2192 on. So if the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present, then that fits. But how do we know if other pairs would work?\n\nWait, but what if 1 and 2 are also blickets? Let's see: if all four are blickets, then the machine would require all to be present. But when 0 was alone, it's off. So that can't be. So if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, and the blickets are 0 and 3, then the machine would turn on when both are present. But in the case where 0 and 3 are on with others (non-blickets), it's on. If either is missing, it's off. That fits the observations.\n\nBut to confirm this, I need to test other combinations. For example, put 0 and 3 on the machine alone, without 1 and 2. Let's see: if I take 1 and 2 off, and have only 0 and 3 on, does the machine turn on?\n\nBut in the current state, after step8, all four are on the machine, and the light is on. If I take 1 and 2 off, then the machine would have 0 and 3. If the light stays on, then the rule is that at least 0 and 3 are present. If it turns off, then maybe all four need to be on (but that would mean all are blickets). But from the previous steps, when 0,1,2,3 were all on, it's on. Then removing 3 turns it off. So if the rule is that all four must be on, then all are blickets. But that seems unlikely because the problem states \"some\" objects are blickets. So maybe the correct rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are present. If the blickets are 0 and 3, then when both are on, regardless of others, it should turn on. But in the case where 0 and 3 are on the machine with 1 and 2, it's on. But when only 0 and 3 are on, does it stay on?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the presence of at least one blicket. But when 0 was alone, it didn't turn on. So that can't be. So maybe the rule is that all blickets must be present. If the blickets are 0 and 3, then whenever both are on the machine, the machine turns on. Let's see:\n\nIn the current state (after step8), all four are on, and the machine is on. If I take 1 and 2 off, leaving 0 and 3, the machine should stay on if the rule is that both 0 and 3 are required. If the machine turns off, then the rule might require all four to be present (so all are blickets).\n\nSo the next step should be to test this. Let's take off objects 1 and 2. If the machine stays on, then the blickets are 0 and 3, and the rule is that both must be present. If it turns off, then perhaps all four are blickets and the rule is that all must be present.\n\nBut in the previous step, when all four were on, the machine was on. When 3 was removed, leaving 0,1,2, it turned off. Adding 3 back turned it on. So if the rule is that all four must be present, then they are all blickets. But that seems counterintuitive because the problem states \"some\" are blickets, not all. However, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are present. But let's see:\n\nIf 0 and 3 are blickets, then two blickets (even) \u2192 machine off. But in the case when all four are on (assuming 0 and 3 are blickets, 1 and 2 are not), then two blickets \u2192 even \u2192 off. But in the steps, when all four are on, the machine is on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: The definition of a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So, mutual information is non-zero. That means that changing the presence of a blicket affects the machine's state. So, if an object is a blicket, then adding or removing it can change the machine's state, given the other objects' states.\n\nIn the steps taken so far:\n\n- Adding 0 to 1,2,3 caused the machine to turn on. So adding 0 when 1,2,3 are present makes a change. Therefore, 0's presence is affecting the machine. Similarly, adding 3 when 0,1,2 are present also affects the machine.\n\nBut wait, when 3 was removed (step7), the machine turned off. So removing 3 when 0,1,2 were present caused it to turn off. So 3's presence is affecting the machine. Similarly, adding 0 in step6 caused the machine to turn on when 1,2,3 were already present.\n\nSo perhaps both 0 and 3 are blickets. Let's test mutual information:\n\nFor object 0: When 0 is on the machine, does the machine's state depend on it? When 0 was alone, machine was off. When 0 was added to 1,2,3, machine turned on. But when 0 was removed (after step6, but in the steps, after putting 0 on, the machine is on. Then removing 3 turns it off. So, the machine's state depends on 0 and 3's presence. So both 0 and 3 are blickets.\n\nSimilarly, object 3: When 3 is added (step8) to 0,1,2, the machine turns on. When removed (step7), it turns off. So 3's presence affects the machine.\n\nObjects 1 and 2: When they were added (steps3 and 4) without 0, the machine remained off. When 0 was added (step6), the machine turned on. But when 1 and 2 are present along with 0 and 3, the machine is on. If I remove 1 and 2, leaving 0 and 3, does the machine stay on? If yes, then 1 and 2 are not blickets. If no, then they are part of the rule.\n\nSo, to test this, I need to remove objects 1 and 2 while leaving 0 and 3 on the machine. Let's try that.\n\nCurrent state after step8: objects 0,1,2,3 are on the machine, light is on.\n\nIf I take object 1 off the machine:\n\n> take object 1 off the machine\n\nThe machine would then have 0,2,3. If the light remains on, then 1 is not a blicket. If it turns off, then 1 is a blicket. Similarly for 2.\n\nBut according to previous steps, when all four were on, light was on. Removing 3 turned it off. So perhaps 3 is a blicket. Similarly, adding 0 caused it to turn on when others were present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if both 0 and 3 are present, regardless of others. Let's test that by removing 1 and 2.\n\nSo, next command: take object 1 off the machine. Then take object 2 off. See if the light stays on.\n\nBut in the current step, after step8, the user needs to input a command. The previous assistant step ended with putting object3 on the machine, making the light on again. So now, the objects on the machine are 0,1,2,3, light is on.\n\nThe next step should be to remove 1 and 2 to see if the machine stays on with only 0 and3.\n\nSo the command would be: take object 1 off the machine. Then check the light. If it's still on, take object2 off. If the light is still on, then 1 and 2 are not blickets, and the rule is that 0 and3 must be present. If it turns off when removing either, then those are blickets.\n\nBut since I can only output one command per step, let's start with taking object1 off.\n\nThe command would be: take object 1 off the machine.\n\nBut according to the previous steps, after step8, the machine is on with all four objects. So after taking 1 off, the machine has 0,2,3. If the light stays on, then 1 is not a blicket. If it turns off, then 1 is a blicket.\n\nBut given the previous interactions, when 3 was removed (leaving 0,1,2), the light turned off. So that suggests that 3 is a blicket. When 0 was added to 1,2,3, it turned on. But when 0 was alone, it didn't. So maybe 0 and3 are both blickets, and the rule is that both must be present. So when both are on the machine, regardless of others, the light is on. If that's the case, then removing 1 and 2 should leave 0 and3 on, so light should stay on.\n\nSo let's try taking object1 off. If the light stays on, then 1 is not a blicket. Then take object2 off. If light remains on, then 2 is not a blicket. That would confirm that only 0 and3 are blickets, and the rule is that both must be present.\n\nSo the next command should be 'take object 1 off the machine'."}

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, here's what I've observed:\n\nInitially, all objects were on the floor. When I put object 0 on the machine alone, nothing happened. Then I took it off. Then I added objects 1, 2, 3 one by one, each time the machine stayed off. But when I added object 0 again (so now all four objects are on the machine), the light turned on. Then I took off object 3, and the light turned off. Adding object 3 back turned it on again. Then removing object 1 left the light still on. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's list the steps again:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Take 0 off.\n3. Put 1 on: still off.\n4. Put 2 on: still off.\n5. Put 3 on: still off.\n6. Put 0 back on: now light turns on. So with all four on, it's on.\n7. Take 3 off: light turns off.\n8. Put 3 back on: light on again.\n9. Take 1 off: light remains on.\n\nSo after step 6, all four objects are on the machine and the light is on. Then removing 3 (so objects 0,1,2 are on) turns it off. Adding 3 back (so 0,1,2,3) turns it on again. Then removing 1 (objects 0,2,3) leaves the light on. So the machine stayed on even after removing object 1. That suggests that object 1 might not be necessary once the others are there. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two specific objects are present. Or perhaps it's a combination where certain objects must be present together. Let's think about the cases:\n\nWhen all four are on, it's on. When 0,1,2,3 are on: on. Then removing 3 (leaving 0,1,2) turns it off. Then adding 3 back (all four) turns it on. Then removing 1 (0,2,3) leaves it on. So in that case, 0,2,3 are on and the machine is on. So maybe the presence of 0 and 3 is sufficient? Or maybe a specific pair?\n\nWait, let's check when the machine was on. First time, all four objects were on. Second time, after adding 3 back (so again all four). Then after removing 1, the machine remains on with 0,2,3. So that's three objects. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when objects 0, 2, and 3 are present. But how can we confirm?\n\nLet me think: when only objects 0,2,3 are on the machine, does the light stay on? After step 9, the objects on the machine are 0,2,3 (since we took 1 off). The light was on. So that combination works. But earlier, when we had 1,2,3 on the machine (after putting 1,2,3 on, then adding 0), the machine turned on. Wait, but when I first put 1,2,3 on, the machine was off. Then adding 0 made it turn on. So that suggests that 0 is necessary. Then when 0,1,2,3 are on, it's on. Removing 3 (leaving 0,1,2) turns it off. Then adding 3 back (0,1,2,3) turns it on again. Then removing 1 (0,2,3) leaves it on. So in that case, 0,2,3 are on and the light is on. So 0 is present in both cases. So maybe 0 is a blicket, and maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when 0 is present along with at least one other blicket. But what other objects are blickets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. Let's consider possible combinations:\n\nWhen 0 is alone: off. When 1,2,3 are on (without 0): off. Adding 0 to them turns it on. Then removing 3 (0,1,2) turns it off. Then adding 3 back turns it on. Then removing 1 (0,2,3) keeps it on. So when 0 is present with 2 and 3, it's on. If 0 is a blicket, then perhaps 3 is also a blicket. Because when 0 and 3 are present (along with 2), it's on. But wait, when 0 and 3 are present, but maybe 2 is not a blicket. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires object 0 and at least one other blicket (like 3). Let's test that.\n\nIf 0 and 3 are blickets, then putting both on should turn it on. Let's see: previously, when 0 was alone, it's off. When 1,2,3 are on (without 0), it's off. When 0 is added (all four), it's on. Then removing 3 (0,1,2) turns it off. Adding 3 back turns it on. Then removing 1 (0,2,3) keeps it on. So with 0,2,3 on, it's on. But if 2 isn't a blicket, then the presence of 0 and 3 (two blickets) would turn it on. But in that case, 2 is not a blicket but the machine is on when 0,2,3 are present. So that doesn't fit unless the rule is that at least two blickets are present. Wait, if 0 and 3 are blickets, then even with 0 and 3 on, regardless of others, the machine would be on. But in the case where 0 and 3 are on the machine with 2, it's on. But what if 0 and 3 are on without others? Let's see: when we put 0 and 3 on the machine, would that turn it on? Let's check the steps. The first time all four were on (0,1,2,3), then removing 3 made it off. So 0,1,2 were on, which includes 0 but maybe the others aren't blickets. Then adding 3 (0,1,2,3) made it on again. Then removing 1 (0,2,3) kept it on. So 0,2,3 are on and it's on. If 0 and 3 are blickets, then maybe 2 isn't a blicket, but the presence of 0 and 3 is sufficient. But why did the machine turn on when all four were on (including 1, which might not be a blicket)? That would still fit if the rule is \"at least two blickets (0 and 3) are present\". Then even if 1 and 2 are on, the presence of 0 and 3 would be enough. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when both object 0 and object 3 are on the machine. Let's test that.\n\nIf the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present, then:\n\n- When 0 and 3 are on together, machine is on.\n- If either is missing, it's off.\n\nIn the steps:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2,3 on, machine is on. So 0 and 3 are present, so on.\n- Take 3 off: 0,1,2 left. Machine off. Correct.\n- Put 3 back on: 0,1,2,3. Machine on. Correct.\n- Take 1 off: 0,2,3. Machine remains on. Correct, since 0 and 3 are still present.\n\nSo this fits. But then, what about if only 0 and 3 are on? Let's check if that's possible. The user hasn't tried that yet. So perhaps the next step is to test putting only 0 and 3 on the machine to see if it turns on. If that's the case, then the rule is that both 0 and 3 are blickets and both must be present. But wait, the user's previous steps didn't test that scenario. So maybe that's what I should try next.\n\nCurrent state after step 9: Objects on the machine are 0,2,3 (since 1 was taken off). The light is on. If I take 2 off, leaving 0 and 3, does the light stay on?\n\nSo next command could be 'take object 2 off the machine'. If the light stays on, that supports the rule that 0 and 3 are the required blickets. If it turns off, then maybe 2 is also a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any two blickets are present. But in that case, if 0 and 3 are blickets, then putting them together would turn it on, and adding others wouldn't affect it. But the initial test when all four were on, and then removing 1 (leaving 0,2,3) kept it on. If 2 is a blicket, then 0,2,3 would be three blickets, so the machine would stay on. But we need to check if 2 is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine requires exactly two blickets. But that's less likely given the steps.\n\nSo to test the hypothesis that 0 and 3 are blickets and both are required, the next step is to remove object 2 from the machine (current state: 0,2,3 on, light on). If after removing 2 (leaving 0 and 3), the light stays on, then 0 and 3 are the required blickets. If the light turns off, then 2 is also a blicket, so maybe the rule requires three blickets, but that seems more complex.\n\nSo the next command should be to take object 2 off the machine. Let's see what happens."}

The goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. So far, I've tried putting all objects on the machine and observed when the light turns on or off.\n\nInitially, when I placed object 0 alone on the machine, the light stayed off. Then I took it off. Then I added objects 1, 2, and 3 one by one, but the light was still off. But when I added object 0 again (making all four objects on the machine), the light turned on. Then I took object 3 off, and the light turned off. Adding object 3 back made it turn on again. Then removing object 1 and 2, the light stayed on. Wait, that's confusing. When I had all four objects on, the light was on. Removing 3 turned it off, but when I put 3 back, it turned on again. Then when I took off 1 and 2, leaving 0 and 3, the light stayed on. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's retrace the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on: light off.\n2. Took 0 off.\n3. Put 1, 2, 3 on: light off.\n4. Put 0 on (now all four on machine): light turns on.\n5. Took 3 off: light turns off.\n6. Put 3 back on: light on again.\n7. Took 1 off: light remains on.\n8. Took 2 off: light remains on.\n\nSo, after step 8, the machine has objects 0 and 3 on it, and the light is on. That suggests that maybe objects 0 and 3 are blickets. Because even when 1 and 2 are removed, the light stays on. But why did the light turn on when all four were on? Maybe because at least two specific blickets need to be present. Wait, but when I had 0 and 3, the light was on. Let me check the previous steps again.\n\nWait, when I first put 0 on alone, light was off. Then when all four were on (0,1,2,3), light turned on. Then removing 3 made it turn off. Adding 3 back made it turn on. Then removing 1 and 2, leaving 0 and 3, the light stayed on. So that suggests that 0 and 3 are the blickets, and the rule might be that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present. But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But when I took 3 off (assuming 0 and 3 are blickets), the light turned off. Then putting 3 back made it on. Then removing 1 and 2 (non-blickets) didn't affect it. So if the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine, then in that case, the blickets would be 0 and 3. Because when both are on, the machine is on. If either is off, it's off. Wait, but when I took 3 off, machine turned off. When I put it back, on. Then when I removed 1 and 2, which are non-blickets, it stayed on. So that fits with the rule: machine is on if and only if all blickets are on it. So if 0 and 3 are blickets, then when both are on the machine, regardless of others, the machine is on. But in the first case, when I put all four on, including 0 and 3, the machine turned on. Then removing 3 (a blicket) turned it off. Adding 3 back turned it on. Then removing 1 and 2 (non-blickets) didn't affect it. So that seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I added 1,2,3 on the machine (without 0), the light was off. Then adding 0 made it turn on. So 0 is a blicket. Then taking 3 off turned it off, so 3 must also be a blicket. Therefore, the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine for it to turn on. So if 0 and 3 are blickets, then both must be on. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nAnother test: put 0 and 3 on the machine, without 1 and 2. The light should be on. Let's see in the steps. After putting 0 on, then 1,2,3, then adding 0 again (wait, maybe that step was redundant). Wait, step 4: put object 0 on the machine when 1,2,3 were already on. Then the light turned on. So with 0,1,2,3 on, light on. Then removing 3 (a blicket) turns it off. So that supports the idea that 0 and 3 are both required. Then putting 3 back (so 0,1,2,3 again) turns it on. Then removing 1 and 2 (non-blickets) leaves 0 and 3, and the light stays on. So yes, the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. The blickets are 0 and 3. So if both are on the machine, regardless of others, the light is on. If either is missing, it's off.\n\nBut let me check another scenario. Suppose I have only 0 on the machine. Light is off. Then add 3. Light turns on. But earlier when I first put 0 on alone, light was off. Then when I put 3 on with others, adding 0 again (but maybe that's a confusion). Wait, in the previous steps, when I put 0 on after 1,2,3 were already on, the light turned on. So that's when all four are on. Then when 3 is removed, light off. Then adding 3 back (so 0,1,2,3) turns on. Then removing 1 and 2 (leaving 0 and 3) keeps the light on. So that's consistent.\n\nAnother test would be to take all objects off except 0 and 3. If the light is on, then that confirms the rule. But in the current state, after taking 1 and 2 off, the machine has 0 and 3, and the light is on. So yes. Now, if I take 0 off, the light should turn off. Let's try that.\n\nBut I need to do that in the next step. But the user is now asking for the next command. The previous steps ended with the machine having 0 and 3 on it, light on. Then I took 1 and 2 off. Now, the next step would be to take 0 off and see if the light turns off. If it does, that confirms 0 is a blicket. Similarly for 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by removing one of them. Let's see. The current state is: objects 0 and 3 are on the machine, 1 and 2 are on the floor. The light is on. So the next command would be to take object 0 off. If the light turns off, that would confirm that both 0 and 3 are needed. But according to the rule that all blickets must be present, removing either would turn it off. So if I take 0 off, light should turn off. Let me try that.\n\nBut in the step history, the last action was taking object 2 off, leaving 0,3 on the machine. The light is on. So next step: take object 0 off. Let's see what happens."}

So the goal is to find which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. From the previous interactions, here's what happened:\n\nInitially, all objects were on the floor. The machine was off. Then I started putting objects one by one on the machine. When I put object 0 alone, nothing happened. Then I took it off. Then added objects 1, 2, 3 one by one, but the machine stayed off. Then when I added object 0 again (so all four objects on the machine), the light turned on. Then removing object 3 turned it off, but putting it back made it on again. Then removing objects 1 and 2 didn't turn it off, but removing object 0 turned it off.\n\nHmm, so maybe the machine turns on when object 0 and object 3 are both on the machine? Wait, when all four were on, it was on. Then removing 3 turned it off. Adding 3 back made it on again. Then when I took 1 and 2 off, leaving 0 and 3, it stayed on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So that suggests that both 0 and 3 are required. Wait, but when I first put 0 on alone, it didn't turn on. Then later, after adding 1,2,3, then adding 0 again made it turn on. Wait, maybe there's a different rule. Let me recap the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on: machine off.\n2. Took 0 off.\n3. Put 1, 2, 3 on: machine off.\n4. Put 0 on (now all four are on): machine turns on.\n5. Took 3 off: machine off.\n6. Put 3 back: machine on.\n7. Took 1 and 2 off: machine still on (only 0 and 3 left).\n8. Took 0 off: machine off.\n\nSo when only 0 and 3 are on, machine is on. But when 0 was alone earlier, it didn't work. Wait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. But which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be on the machine. Because when both are present, the machine is on. Let's check the steps again:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2,3 on, machine turns on. Then removing 3 turns it off. Adding 3 back turns it on. Then removing 1 and 2 leaves 0 and 3, machine stays on. Removing 0 turns it off. So when both 0 and 3 are on, the machine is on. When either is missing, it's off. So maybe the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present. But earlier, when only 0 was on, it didn't turn on. But when 0 and 3 are on, it does. So that would mean 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that both need to be on the machine.\n\nWait, but what about when they were all on except 0, then adding 0 made it on. So when 0 is added to 1,2,3, the machine turns on. Then removing 3 turns it off. Then adding 3 back makes it on again. Then removing 1 and 2 (so only 0 and 3) keeps it on. So that's consistent with 0 and 3 being necessary. But why did the machine turn on when all four were on? Because both 0 and 3 were present. The other objects (1 and 2) might not matter. Let me test that.\n\nWait, maybe I should try putting just 0 and 3 on the machine. Let's do that. If I take all off, then put 0 and 3 on, does the machine turn on? Right now, after the last step, all objects are off except after taking 0 off, the machine is off. So maybe I need to test putting 0 and 3 on.\n\nBut how can I do that? Let's see: the current state is all objects on the floor. Let me try putting 0 and 3 on the machine.\n\nSo next step: put object 0 on machine. Then put object 3 on machine. If the machine turns on, that would confirm the rule.\n\nBut I have to do it step by step. Let's proceed."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the interactions so far, I need to look at the steps taken and the results.\n\nFirst, when object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light stayed off. Then, after removing it, objects 1, 2, and 3 were placed one by one, but the light was still off. Then, when object 0 was added again (making all four objects on the machine), the light turned on.

Finally, putting object 0 back alone made the light turn on again.\n\nHmm. So the key seems to be that when object 0 is on the machine, the light is on. But wait, when object 0 was first placed alone, it didn't turn on. Wait, no. Let me check the steps again:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Took 0 off.\n3. Put 1, 2, 3 on machine: light still off.\n4. Put 0 on (so all four on machine): light turns on.\n5. Remove 3: light off. Then adding 3 back turns it on again.\n6. Remove 1 and 2: light stays on. Remove 0: light off.\n7. Put 0 back alone: light on.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. The first time putting 0 alone didn't turn it on, but the last time it did. That suggests that maybe the rule changed, but that's unlikely. More likely, I made a mistake in tracking the steps.\n\nWait, let's go step by step:\n\nInitial state: all objects on floor.\n\n- Put 0 on machine: light off. So 0 alone doesn't turn it on.\n\n- Take 0 off.\n\n- Put 1 on machine: light off.\n\n- Put 2 on machine: light off.\n\n- Put 3 on machine: light off. So all 1,2,3 on machine: no light.\n\n- Put 0 on machine (now all 0,1,2,3 are on): light turns on.\n\nThen remove 3: light off. So removing 3 when all were on made it turn off. Then putting 3 back: light on again.\n\nThen remove 1: light stays on.\n\nRemove 2: light stays on.\n\nRemove 0: light off.\n\nPut 0 back alone: light on.\n\nWait, so when 0 is alone, after having been part of a combination that worked, now it works alone. That suggests that the rule might be that object 0 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But that doesn't explain the initial case where 0 alone didn't work. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are on it. Let's see:\n\nIf 0 is a blicket, then when it's first put alone (1 blicket), machine should turn on. But in the first step, putting 0 on didn't turn it on. So that contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule requires exactly two blickets. Let's see:\n\nIn the case where 0 and 3 are on the machine (after adding 3 back), light is on. If both are blickets, then that's two, but when 0 is alone later, it works. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires that all blickets are on it. So if there are multiple blickets, all must be present. Let's see:\n\nWhen 0 was first placed alone, machine off. Then when all four were on, machine on. Then removing 3 (a blicket?) turned it off. Adding 3 back turned it on. Then removing 1 and 2 (non-blickets) didn't affect, but removing 0 turned it off. Then putting 0 back alone turned it on. So maybe 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that all blickets must be on the machine. But when 0 and 3 are both on, the machine is on. If 0 is on and 3 is off, then machine is off. But when 0 is alone, machine is on. Wait, but that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on if any blicket is present. But in the first case, putting 0 alone didn't turn it on. Unless the initial test was wrong. Wait, no. The first steps:\n\n- Put 0 on machine: light off.\n\nThen later, after all four were on and then 0 was placed alone again, it turned on. So the same object 0 alone caused the light to be on in the later step but not the first. That suggests that the rule isn't just about presence of a single blicket. Maybe the machine's state depends on some combination or sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine turns on when the number of blickets on it is even. Let's test:\n\nIf 0 and 3 are blickets.\n\nFirst, putting 0 (1 blicket): off.\n\nThen all four: 0,1,2,3. If 0 and 3 are blickets, that's 2, even: on.\n\nRemove 3: now 1 blicket (0): off.\n\nAdd 3 back: 2, on.\n\nRemove 1 and 2 (non-blickets): still 0 and 3 (2 blickets): on.\n\nRemove 0: only 3 (1 blicket): off.\n\nPut 0 back: 2 blickets: on.\n\nThis fits. So the rule could be that the machine turns on when an even number of blickets are on it. But then, in the first case, putting 0 alone (1 blicket) would be off, and in the last case, putting 0 alone (1) would be off. But in the last step, putting 0 alone made the light on. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, in the last step, after removing 0, the light was off. Then putting 0 back on, the light turned on. If 0 is a blicket, that would mean 1 blicket (odd) is on, which according to the even rule should be off. But the light turned on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that the machine is on if exactly one blicket is present. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 0 alone: off. So 0 isn't a blicket. But later, 0 alone turns on. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on when a blicket is present, but only when placed after certain interactions. That seems unlikely. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's state depends on the order of placement. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the machine is on if the total number of blickets on it is at least two. But in the last step, 0 alone turned it on. So that would require 0 to be a blicket, but then 0 alone would be one, which is less than two. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the steps:\n\nAfter putting all four objects on the machine, the light turns on. Then removing 3 (object 3) turns it off. Adding 3 back turns it on. Then removing 1 and 2 (non-blickets) leaves 0 and 3, and the light stays on. Removing 0 (now only 3 is on) turns it off. Then putting 0 back on (now 0 alone) turns it on.\n\nSo when 0 is on alone, light is on. But when 0 was first placed alone, light was off. That's inconsistent unless the rule changed, which it can't. So there must be another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's state depends on the presence of certain combinations. For example, 0 and 3 together. Let's see:\n\n- When 0 and 3 are both on (with others), the light is on. When 3 is removed, light off. When 3 is added back, light on. Then removing 1 and 2 (non-blickets), leaving 0 and 3: light on. Removing 0: light off. Adding 0 back: light on. So perhaps 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that at least one of them must be present. But in the first step, putting 0 alone didn't turn it on. Unless there's a mistake in the logs.\n\nWait, no. The first step was putting 0 on the machine, light off. Then after all four are on, adding 0 again (maybe it was already on? Wait, let me check the exact sequence:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Take 0 off.\n3. Put 1 on: light off.\n4. Put 2 on: light off.\n5. Put 3 on: light off.\n6. Put 0 on: light turns on. Now all four are on the machine.\n\nSo at step 6, adding 0 to 1,2,3 makes it turn on. Then remove 3: light off. Add 3 back: light on. So with 0,1,2,3: on. Remove 1: light stays on. Remove 2: light stays on. Now only 0 and 3 are on. Then remove 0: light off. Add 0 back: light on (now 0 alone).\n\nSo the key seems to be that when both 0 and 3 are on, the machine is on, and when only 0 is on, it's on. But initially, when 0 was alone, it was off. That's a contradiction unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires that exactly two specific blickets are present. For example, 0 and 3. When both are on, the machine is on. But when only 0 is on, it's off. But in the last step, putting 0 alone turned it on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on if any of the blickets are present. But again, the first step with 0 alone was off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's state is triggered by a specific combination. Like, when 0 is present with any other blicket. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if the number of blickets on it is greater than or equal to 2. Then, when 0 and 3 are on (assuming both are blickets), it's on. When 0 is alone (1 blicket), it's off. But in the last step, putting 0 alone turned it on. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, the last step: after removing 0 (which turned the light off), putting 0 back on made the light turn on. So in that case, 0 alone was sufficient. So perhaps 0 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when 0 is present. But why did it not turn on the first time 0 was placed alone?\n\nAh, wait, maybe there's a mistake in the log. Let me check again:\n\nFirst interaction:\n\n> put object 0 on the machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nThen, after several steps, when putting 0 back on (after having all four on and then removing others), the light turns on.\n\nSo the same object 0 caused the light to turn on in one case but not the other. That's confusing. How can that happen? Unless there's a different rule, like the machine requires at least two blickets, but after some condition is met, even one suffices. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state depends on the presence of certain objects in sequence. For example, once a blicket has been activated, it can trigger the machine alone. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a hidden state in the machine, like it needs to be \"primed\" by having multiple blickets first. But that's getting too complex.\n\nWait, another possibility: the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are present. Let's assume that 0 and 3 are blickets.\n\nFirst, 0 alone (1 blicket, odd): machine should be on. But in the first step, it was off. So that's a problem.\n\nBut later, when 0 is placed alone again (after being part of a group with 3), it's on. So maybe the machine's rule changed. But that's impossible unless the rule is dynamic, which the problem states it's a hidden rule, so it should be static.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to list all the states:\n\n1. 0 on: off.\n2. 1,2,3 on: off.\n3. 0,1,2,3 on: on.\n4. Remove 3 (0,1,2 on): off.\n5. Add 3 (0,1,2,3 on): on.\n6. Remove 1 (0,2,3 on): on.\n7. Remove 2 (0,3 on): on.\n8. Remove 0 (3 on): off.\n9. Add 0 (0 on): on.\n\nSo when 0 and 3 are on (steps 7 and 9), the machine is on. But in step 7, 0 and 3 are on (two blickets?), and in step 9, 0 alone is on (but machine is on). So if 0 is a blicket, step 9 would mean machine is on with one blicket. But step 1 had 0 alone and machine off. So this inconsistency suggests that maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on if at least one of the blickets is present, but only after a certain condition. For example, after a blicket has been placed in combination with others. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on if any blicket is present, but only if it's the last one placed. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on if the sum of the blicket's \"values\" meets a threshold. For example, each blicket has a value of 1, and the machine turns on if the sum is >= 2. Then:\n\n- 0 alone: sum 1 \u2192 off.\n- 1,2,3 (non-blickets) sum 0 \u2192 off.\n- 0,1,2,3: sum 1 (assuming only 0 is a blicket) \u2192 off. But in the log, this combination turned on. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe 0 and 3 are blickets. Then:\n\n- 0 alone: sum 1 \u2192 off.\n- 1,2,3: sum 0 \u2192 off.\n- 0,1,2,3: sum 2 \u2192 on.\n- Remove 3: sum 1 \u2192 off.\n- Add 3 back: sum 2 \u2192 on.\n- Remove 1 and 2: sum 2 (0 and 3) \u2192 on.\n- Remove 0: sum 1 (3) \u2192 off.\n- Add 0: sum 2 (0 and 3) \u2192 on. But in the log, adding 0 alone (step 9) turned it on. But according to this, sum would be 1 (0 alone is a blicket). So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Let's try another approach: looking for mutual information between objects and the machine's state.\n\nA blicket is an object where the presence of the object affects the machine's state. So we need to see which objects, when present, correlate with the machine being on.\n\nLooking at the steps:\n\n- When 0 was first placed alone: machine off. When 0 was added to 1,2,3: machine on. Then removing 3 made it off. Adding 3 back made it on. Removing 1 and 2 didn't affect. Removing 0 made it off. Adding 0 back made it on.\n\nSo the machine's state seems to depend on 0 and 3. When both are present, it's on. If only one is present, it's off. But in the final step, 0 alone is on. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine is on when object 0 is present, regardless of others. But why didn't it turn on the first time? Unless there's a mistake in the logs. Or maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when object 0 is present and at least one other object (any) is also present. Let's test:\n\nFirst time 0 alone: off. Then when 0 is added to 1,2,3 (others present): on. Remove 3 (now 0,1,2): still on. But in the log, when 3 was removed, the light turned off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in the log:\n\nAfter adding 0 to 1,2,3 (all four on), light on.\n\nThen take 3 off: light off. So 0,1,2 are on. Light off. Then add 3 back: light on. Then remove 1: light on. Remove 2: light on. Now 0 and 3 are on. Then remove 0: light off. Add 0 back: light on.\n\nSo when 0 and 3 are both on: light on. When only 0 is on: light on. When only 3 is on: light off. So this suggests that 0 is a blicket and 3 is not. But then, when 0 is present, light is on. But the first time 0 was alone, light was off. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, unless there's a rule that the machine turns on if object 0 is present and at least one other object is present. Let's see:\n\nFirst time 0 alone: off. Then 0 with 1,2,3: on. Remove 3: 0,1,2 \u2192 on. But in the log, removing 3 turned it off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on if object 0 is present along with object 3. Then:\n\n- When both 0 and 3 are on: on.\n- When only 0 or only 3: off.\n\nBut in the final step, 0 alone was on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Let me try to outline possible blickets and rules:\n\nPossible blickets: 0 and 3.\n\nRule: Machine turns on if both are present. But in the final step, 0 alone is on, and the light is on. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, Rule: Machine turns on if object 0 is present. But why first time it was off.\n\nWait, maybe the machine has a toggle effect. Each time you add a blicket, it toggles the state. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when exactly one blicket is present. But then, when 0 and 3 are both present (two blickets), it would be off. But in the log, that's when it's on.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to hypothesize based on the steps:\n\nFrom the steps, the machine turns on when 0 is present and at least one other specific object (like 3) is also present. But in the final step, 0 alone turns it on, which contradicts. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 0 is present. But why the first time it didn't. Maybe there's a mistake in the log? Or perhaps there's a timing aspect. But the problem states the rule is static.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's state depends on the order in which objects are placed. For example, object 0 only activates the machine if it was placed after certain others. But that's too speculative.\n\nAnother angle: mutual information. A blicket's state is not independent of the machine's state. So we need to find which objects' presence correlates with the machine's state.\n\nLooking at object 0:\n\n- When 0 is on the machine, sometimes the light is on and sometimes off. For example:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n- 0 with others: on (after being added to 1,2,3).\n- Later, 0 alone: on.\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard to see a direct correlation. But maybe there's another factor.\n\nLooking at object 3:\n\n- When 3 is added to 0,1,2 (all four on): light on.\n- Removing 3 (0,1,2 left): light off.\n- Adding 3 back: light on.\n- Later, removing 1 and 2 (0 and 3 left): light on.\n- Removing 0 (3 alone): light off.\n- Adding 0 back: light on.\n\nSo when 0 and 3 are both on, light is on. When only 0 is on, light is on. When only 3 is on, light is off. When 0 is off, light is off.\n\nThis suggests that 0 is a blicket and the machine turns on when 0 is present. But why did 0 alone not work the first time? That's the inconsistency.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the log. Let me check again:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. put object 0 on the machine \u2192 light off.\n...\n6. put object 0 on the machine (now all four) \u2192 light on.\n...\n9. take object 0 off \u2192 light off.\n10. put object 0 on \u2192 light on.\n\nSo the first time 0 is added alone: light off. The second time (after having been part of a group where light was on), adding 0 alone: light on.\n\nThis suggests that the state of the machine depends on something else. Maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 0 is present and has been placed after at least two other objects. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if the number of blickets on it is odd. Let's say 0 is the only blicket. Then:\n\n- 0 alone: 1 (odd) \u2192 on. But first step was off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, 0 and 3 are blickets.\n\n- When both are on (2, even) \u2192 off. But in steps where both were on, the light was on. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. Then:\n\n- 0 alone (if blicket): on. But first step was off. Contradiction.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the rule is more complex, like the machine requires exactly two blickets, and those are 0 and 3. Then:\n\n- When both are on: light on.\n- When only one is on: light off.\n\nBut in the final step, 0 alone is on, and light is on. Contradiction.\n\nWait, but according to the log:\n\nAfter step 9: remove 0 (light off), then put 0 back: light on. So 0 alone now causes light on. So if 0 is a blicket, the rule must be that presence of any blicket turns it on. But first time 0 was on alone: light off. That's a contradiction.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the log. Maybe the user made a typo. But assuming the log is correct, I must find a rule that explains this.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on if an odd number of blickets are present, and the blickets are 0 and 3. Let's see:\n\n- First, 0 alone (1 blicket, odd \u2192 on), but log says off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are present. If the blickets are 0 and 3:\n\n- When both are on: on.\n- When only one is on: off.\n\nBut in the final step, 0 alone is on, and the light is on. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when any blicket is present. So if 0 is a blicket, then when 0 is present, light is on. But first time 0 was on, light was off. So this can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when the total number of objects on it is even. Then:\n\n- 0 alone (1 object): off.\n- 4 objects: even \u2192 on.\n- Remove 3 (3 objects \u2192 odd): off.\n- Add 3 (4 \u2192 on).\n- Remove 1 and 2 (2 objects \u2192 even): on.\n- Remove 0 (1 \u2192 off).\n- Add 0 (1 \u2192 off). But in the log, adding 0 back made it on. Contradiction.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of objects is a multiple of 3. But 4 objects \u2192 not. 3 objects: yes. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to think differently. The mutual information between object and machine state means that the presence of the object affects the probability of the machine being on. So, for each object, we can check if the machine's state changes when the object is added or removed, holding other variables constant.\n\nLooking at object 0:\n\n- When adding 0 to 1,2,3: machine turns on. Removing 0 when others are on (like 3) turns it off. So adding 0 when others are on correlates with the machine turning on. But when 0 is alone, sometimes it's off, sometimes on. So maybe 0 is a blicket, and the rule requires 0 plus another condition.\n\nLooking at object 3:\n\n- Adding 3 to 0,1,2 turns it on. Removing 3 from 0,1,2,3 turns it off. Adding 3 back turns it on. So 3's presence is correlated with the machine's state when 0 is present. Maybe 3 is a blicket and the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present.\n\nBut when 0 is added alone at the end, the machine turns on. That would contradict this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when any of the blickets are present, but there was a mistake in the first step. Or perhaps the first step was a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if object 0 is present, but only if it was the last object placed. But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state is determined by the presence of object 0, and the other objects have no effect. But the first time 0 was placed alone, the light was off, and later it was on. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe there's a hidden state in the machine. For example, the machine has a toggle switch that is activated by object 0. First time 0 is placed, it toggles the state. But the initial state is off. So placing 0 would toggle to on. But the log says it was off. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires a specific combination of objects. For example, 0 and 3 together, but only after they've been placed in a certain order. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe I should conclude that objects 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when both are present. But the final step contradicts that. Alternatively, object 0 is the only blicket, and the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 0 is present. But then why the first time it didn't.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 0 is present and at least one other object is present. So:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n- 0 with others: on.\n- Removing others but leaving 0: on. But in the log, when others were removed and only 0 was left, the light stayed on.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter step 7: objects 0,3 are on. Light is on.\n\nThen remove 0: light off. Add 0 back: light on (now 0 alone). So according to this, the rule would require 0 alone to be sufficient. But the first time it wasn't. So this is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the log, but I have to work with what's provided.\n\nGiven the evidence, the only consistent factor is that object 0's presence correlates with the machine being on in later steps, but not initially. This suggests that maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is present, but there was an error in the first interaction. Alternatively, the rule involves object 0 and some other condition that changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 0 is placed after object 3. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven the steps, the strongest correlation is that object 0 is a blicket and the machine turns on when it's present. Despite the initial inconsistency, maybe the first step was a mistake or there's a different rule. For example, maybe the machine requires object 0 to be present along with any other object. But when object 0 was added to 1,2,3, it turned on. Then removing 3 turned it off. Adding 3 back turned it on. Then removing 1 and 2, leaving 0 and 3: still on. Removing 0 turns it off. Adding 0 back turns it on. So if the rule is that object 0 and at least one other object (any) must be present, then:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n- 0 with others: on.\n- 0 with 3: on.\n- 0 alone after others are removed: off. But in the log, adding 0 alone after others were removed turned it on. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I think the most plausible answer is that object 0 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when it's present. The initial contradiction might be due to a hidden factor, like the machine requiring a certain number of objects to be placed before it activates, but that's not stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are present, and objects 0 and 3 are blickets. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on if the sum of the objects' IDs is even. Object IDs are 0,1,2,3.\n\n- 0 alone: 0 \u2192 even \u2192 on. But log says off.\n- 0,1,2,3: sum 6 \u2192 even \u2192 on.\n- Remove 3: sum 0+1+2=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 off. Log matches.\n- Add 3: sum 6 \u2192 even \u2192 on.\n- Remove 1 and 2: sum 0+3=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 off. But log says on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think the best hypothesis is that object 0 and object 3 are blickets, and the machine turns on when both are present. However, in the final step, object 0 alone turns it on, which contradicts this. Therefore, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is present, regardless of others. The initial step's inconsistency could be due to a mistake or a different condition.\n\nGiven the information, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that object 0 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when it's present. The initial step might have been a test where the machine didn't activate because of a different reason (e.g., needed to be placed after another object), but given the later steps, object 0 seems crucial."}

So, the goal is to determine if object 0 is a blicket. From the definition, a blicket is an object whose state (being on the machine or not) has mutual information with the machine's state (on or off). That means the presence of the blicket on the machine affects whether the machine turns on.\n\nLooking at the interactions:\n\nFirst, when object 0 was placed alone on the machine initially, the light stayed off. Then, after all objects (0,1,2,3) were on the machine, the light turned on when object 0 was added again. Wait, actually, let me check the steps again.\n\nThe user put object 0 on the machine first. The light was off. Then they took it off. Then they put 1, 2, 3 on, each time the light stayed off. Then adding 0 again (so all four on) made the light turn on. Then when they took off 3, the light went off. Adding 3 back made it on again. Then removing 1 and 2, leaving 0 and 3, the light stayed on. Then removing 0 made it turn off. Putting 0 back on alone turned it on again.\n\nWait, let me parse the exact steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on machine: light off.\n2. Take 0 off.\n3. Put 1 on: light off.\n4. Put 2 on: light off.\n5. Put 3 on: light off.\n6. Put 0 on again (now all 4 on machine): light turns on.\n7. Take 3 off: light off.\n8. Put 3 back on: light on.\n9. Take 1 off: light stays on.\n10. Take 2 off: light stays on.\n11. Take 0 off: light off.\n12. Put 0 on alone: light on.\n\nSo, when all four are on, it's on. Removing 3 (step 7) leaves 0,1,2 on, but light turns off. Then putting 3 back (step8) with 0,1,2,3 again, light on. Then removing 1 and 2 (steps9-10), leaving 0 and 3, light remains on. Then removing 0 (step11) leaves 3 alone, light off. Then putting 0 back (step12) alone, light on.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. When 0 and 3 are on the machine (after steps9-10), the light is on. Then removing 0 (leaving 3) makes it off. Putting 0 back alone turns it on.\n\nSo, when 0 is on the machine alone, the light is on. But in step1, putting 0 alone on the machine kept the light off. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait no\u2014looking back:\n\nFirst time putting 0 on machine (step1): light off.\n\nBut later (step12), putting 0 on machine alone: light on.\n\nSo that's a problem. How is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the step sequence. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nAfter initial setup (all objects on floor), the actions are:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine: light off.\n\nThen take 0 off.\n\nThen put 1, 2, 3 on machine (each step, light remains off).\n\nThen put 0 on machine again (step6). Now all four objects are on machine. Light turns on.\n\nThen take 3 off (step7): light off.\n\nPut 3 back (step8): light on.\n\nTake 1 off (step9): light remains on.\n\nTake 2 off (step10): light remains on.\n\nTake 0 off (step11): light off.\n\nPut 0 on alone (step12): light on.\n\nWait, that's the key. So when step6: adding 0 to the machine (which already has 1,2,3) makes the light turn on. Then step7, removing 3 (so 0,1,2 remain) makes the light off. Then step8, adding 3 back (all four again) turns it on. Then step9, remove 1: 0,2,3 on, light remains on. Step10, remove 2: 0 and 3 on, light stays on. Step11, remove 0: 3 alone on, light off. Step12, put 0 on alone: light on.\n\nSo, when 0 is alone, light is on. But earlier, when 0 was alone (step1), the light was off. So why the difference?\n\nAh, perhaps the rule is that the machine activates when the sum of the blickets' values meets a certain condition. For example, maybe the machine requires at least two blickets to be on. But that might not fit here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is on. But in step12, 0 alone makes it on. But in step1, 0 alone didn't. That would be a contradiction unless the initial state had some other factors. Wait, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be on. But that doesn't fit the data.\n\nWait, let's try to reconstruct the possible rules. Let's list the machine's state in different scenarios:\n\n- 0 alone (step1): off.\n\n- 1,2,3 on (step5 after putting 3 on, but before adding 0 again): off.\n\n- 0 added to 1,2,3 (step6): on.\n\nSo with all four, it's on. Then removing 3 (0,1,2 on): off. Adding 3 back (all four) on. Removing 1 and 2 (0 and 3 on): still on. Then removing 0 (3 alone): off. Then adding 0 alone: on.\n\nSo the machine is on in these cases:\n\n- All four objects on.\n\n- 0 and 3 on.\n\n- 0 alone.\n\nBut when 0 was first added alone (step1), it was off. That's inconsistent unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's state depends on the presence of certain objects. Let's see.\n\nWhen the machine is on:\n\n- When 0 is present, sometimes it's on, sometimes not.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on. If 0 is a blicket, then when 0 is on alone (step12), it's on. But step1, 0 was on alone and it was off. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets. Let's see.\n\nAssuming objects 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- When 0 is alone (step1): 1 blicket (odd) \u2192 machine on. But in step1, it was off. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least two blickets are present. If 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- All four on: 0 and 3 are blickets. So two \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,1,2 on: only 0 \u2192 one \u2192 off.\n\n- 0 and 3: two \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 alone: one \u2192 off. But in step12, when 0 is alone, the machine is on. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on if any blicket is present. Then 0 is a blicket. But in step1, when 0 was on alone, machine was off. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on if the sum of blickets is >=1, but only if they are in certain positions. Or perhaps the rule is different: the machine is on if exactly two blickets are present. Then:\n\nIf 0 and 3 are blickets.\n\n- All four on: two blickets (0 and 3) \u2192 on.\n\n- 0,1,2 on: one blicket (0) \u2192 off.\n\n- 0 and 3: two \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 alone: one \u2192 off. But in step12, when 0 is alone, machine is on. So again, contradiction.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a different rule. Let's consider that the machine's behavior changed when all four were placed. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on. If 0 and 3 are blickets, then:\n\n- Step6: all four on (0,1,2,3). If 0 and 3 are blickets, then both are on \u2192 machine on.\n\n- Step7: remove 3 \u2192 only 0 is on. So not all blickets \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: add 3 \u2192 both on \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: remove 1 and 2 \u2192 0 and 3 remain. Both on \u2192 machine on.\n\n- Step11: remove 0 \u2192 only 3 (one blicket) \u2192 not all \u2192 off.\n\n- Step12: add 0 \u2192 both on \u2192 machine on.\n\nBut in step1, when 0 was alone, it's a blicket but since 3 wasn't on, the machine was off. Then in step12, adding 0 alone would require 3 to be on as well, but 3 was off. Wait, but in step12, after step11, 3 was off. So step12: 0 is added alone. If the rule is that all blickets must be on, then even if 3 is a blicket, but it's not on, the machine would be off. But in step12, the machine is on when 0 is alone. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this suggests that the rule isn't all blickets must be on.\n\nAlternative approach: look for cases where the machine changes state when an object is added or removed.\n\nWhen adding 0 to the machine when 1,2,3 are already on (step6), the machine turns on. So adding 0 made it on. Then removing 3 (step7) turns it off. Adding 3 back (step8) turns it on. Then removing 1 and 2 (steps9-10) doesn't affect it. Then removing 0 (step11) turns it off. Adding 0 again (step12) turns it on.\n\nSo, the presence of 0 or 3 seems to turn the machine on. But when 0 was added alone initially (step1), it didn't. However, in step12, adding 0 alone does turn it on. So what's different between step1 and step12?\n\nAh, perhaps the machine's state depends on the order of operations or some cumulative effect. Alternatively, maybe the blicketness is activated only when certain combinations are present. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket, but only after a certain condition is met. This seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if either object 0 or object 3 is on. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn step1: 0 is on \u2192 machine off. So this would contradict.\n\nIn step6: all four on \u2192 machine on. But if only 0 and 3 are blickets, then their presence would trigger it. But in step6, they are both on. Maybe the rule is that at least one of them is on. But in step1, 0 is on alone, machine is off. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one of 0 or 3 is on. But step6 has both on, and the machine is on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the machine turns on if at least one of 0 or 3 is on. But step1: 0 is on, machine off. So that's a contradiction unless the rule changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when 0 and 3 are both on. Let's check:\n\n- Step6: both 0 and 3 on (with others) \u2192 machine on.\n\n- Step7: 3 off, 0 on \u2192 machine off.\n\n- Step8: both on \u2192 machine on.\n\n- Steps9-10: both on \u2192 machine remains on.\n\n- Step11: 3 on, 0 off \u2192 machine off.\n\n- Step12: 0 on, 3 off \u2192 machine on. But this contradicts the rule because 3 is off.\n\nSo this hypothesis fails.\n\nAlternatively, the machine is on if either 0 or 3 is on, but only when the other is not. That also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on when the number of blickets on the machine is odd. If 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- Step1: 1 blicket (0) \u2192 odd \u2192 machine on. But in step1, it's off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if only 0 is a blicket:\n\n- Step1: 1 (odd) \u2192 on. But step1 shows off.\n\nNo. Alternatively, if 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- Step6: 2 blickets (even) \u2192 on. But 2 is even. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if at least two blickets are present. If 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- Step6: two \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: one \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: two \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: two \u2192 on.\n\n- Step11: one \u2192 off.\n\n- Step12: one \u2192 off. But in step12, it's on. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's try to track each object's effect.\n\nObject 0:\n\n- When added alone (step1): off.\n\n- When added to 1,2,3 (step6): on.\n\n- When removed from 0,3 (step11): off.\n\n- When added alone again (step12): on.\n\nSo, the presence of 0 alone sometimes turns it on and sometimes not. That inconsistency suggests that there's another variable involved. Maybe the machine's state depends on the combination of objects. For example, maybe the machine requires both 0 and 3 to be present. Let's check:\n\n- Step6: 0 and 3 are on (with others) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: 0 on, 3 off \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: both on \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: both on \u2192 on.\n\n- Step11: 3 on, 0 off \u2192 off.\n\n- Step12: 0 on, 3 off \u2192 off. But in step12, the machine is on. Contradiction.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the machine turns on when any two specific objects are present. For example, 0 and 3. Let's see:\n\n- In step6, all four are on (including 0 and 3) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: 0 and 3 not both on \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: both on \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: both on \u2192 on.\n\n- Step11: only 3 \u2192 off.\n\n- Step12: only 0 \u2192 off. But step12 shows on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when 0 is present, regardless of others. But in step1, 0 was present and machine was off. So that's a problem unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on if an odd number of objects are on the machine. Let's check:\n\n- Step1: 1 object \u2192 odd \u2192 on. But step1 shows off.\n\n- Step6: 4 objects \u2192 even \u2192 off. But step6 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at when the machine turns on and off.\n\nMachine turns on when:\n\n- Adding 0 to 1,2,3 (step6: 4 objects \u2192 on).\n\n- Adding 3 to 0,1,2 (step8: 4 objects \u2192 on).\n\n- Adding 0 alone (step12: 1 object \u2192 on).\n\nMachine turns off when:\n\n- Removing 3 from 4 objects (step7: 3 objects \u2192 off).\n\n- Removing 0 from 2 objects (step11: 1 object \u2192 off).\n\nSo maybe the rule is that the machine is on when the number of objects on it is even. But step6: 4 (even) \u2192 on. Step7: 3 (odd) \u2192 off. Step8: 4 (even) \u2192 on. Step9: 3 (even?) Wait step9: after removing 1, there are 3 objects (0,2,3). Then step10: removing 2 leaves 0 and 3 (even?) \u2192 on. Step11: removing 0 leaves 1 (odd) \u2192 off. Step12: adding 0 \u2192 1 (odd) \u2192 but light is on. Contradiction. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the machine is on when exactly two objects are present. But step6: four objects \u2192 on. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the machine is on when the sum of the object indices is even. Let's see:\n\n- Step6: objects 0,1,2,3 \u2192 sum 0+1+2+3=6 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: objects 0,1,2 \u2192 sum 3 (odd) \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: sum 6 \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: objects 0,3 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 off. But in step10, the light stays on. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to think of each object's contribution.\n\nWhen object 0 is on the machine:\n\n- When 0 is added to 1,2,3 \u2192 machine on.\n\n- When 0 is alone \u2192 machine on (step12).\n\nBut when 0 is added alone the first time (step1), machine is off. So why the difference?\n\nWait, maybe the machine requires at least two objects to be on, and one of them is 0. Let's test:\n\n- Step1: only 0 \u2192 off.\n\n- Step6: four objects (including 0) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: three objects (0,1,2) \u2192 on? No, machine turns off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on if any of the blickets are present and there's at least two objects. If 0 is a blicket:\n\n- Step1: only 0 (blicket) but only one object \u2192 off.\n\n- Step6: four objects (including 0) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: three objects (0,1,2) \u2192 if 0 is a blicket and there are three objects, then on. But step7: machine turns off. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. Then:\n\n- Step1: 0 is a blicket, alone \u2192 on. But in step1, it's off. Contradiction.\n\nSo this is confusing. Let's consider that maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is present and the total number of objects is odd.\n\n- Step1: 0 present, count 1 (odd) \u2192 on. But step1 shows off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on when object 0 is present and object 3 is also present. Let's see:\n\n- Step6: 0 and 3 present \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: 0 present, 3 not \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: both present \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: both present \u2192 on.\n\n- Step11: 3 present, 0 not \u2192 off.\n\n- Step12: 0 present, 3 not \u2192 off. But step12 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nWait, but step12: 0 alone, machine on. So this suggests that 0 is a blicket and the machine turns on when 0 is present. But why step1, when 0 was alone, machine was off?\n\nUnless there's a different rule. Maybe the machine requires object 0 and at least one other object. Let's test:\n\n- Step1: 0 alone \u2192 off.\n\n- Step6: 0 with others \u2192 on.\n\n- Step12: 0 alone \u2192 on. Contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 0 is present, but only after a certain condition is met. For example, after all four objects have been placed once. But that seems ad hoc.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine turns on if object 0 is present, regardless of other objects. But step1 contradicts this. However, in step12, it works. Why the difference?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state had a different configuration. But according to the logs, after step1, the machine was off. Then in step12, after a series of operations, putting 0 alone makes it on. That suggests that object 0's blicketness depends on some other factor. But the problem states that blicketness is a property of the object, not dependent on history.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the log interpretation. Let me re-examine the steps carefully.\n\nThe steps as per the user:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n2. take 0 off \u2192 light off.\n\n3. put 1 \u2192 off.\n\n4. put 2 \u2192 off.\n\n5. put 3 \u2192 off.\n\n6. put 0 \u2192 light on (now all four on).\n\n7. take 3 off \u2192 light off (remaining 0,1,2).\n\n8. put 3 back \u2192 light on (all four).\n\n9. take 1 off \u2192 light remains on (0,2,3).\n\n10. take 2 off \u2192 light remains on (0,3).\n\n11. take 0 off \u2192 light off (3 alone).\n\n12. put 0 on alone \u2192 light on.\n\nSo, in step6, adding 0 to 1,2,3 turns it on. Then when 3 is removed (step7), leaving 0,1,2, light off. Adding 3 back (step8) turns it on. Removing 1 and 2 (steps9-10) leaves 0 and 3 on, light stays on. Removing 0 (step11) leaves 3 on, light off. Adding 0 alone (step12) turns it on.\n\nSo, the only time the machine is on is when 0 is present, regardless of other objects (except step6 where 0 is added to others and it turns on). But step1: 0 alone \u2192 off.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a different rule. Let's consider that the machine's rule is that it turns on when object 0 and object 3 are both present. Let's check:\n\n- Step6: 0 and 3 present \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: 0 present, 3 not \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: both present \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: both present \u2192 on.\n\n- Step11: 3 present, 0 not \u2192 off.\n\n- Step12: 0 present, 3 not \u2192 off. But step12 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nSo this doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if either 0 or 3 is present. Then:\n\n- Step1: 0 present \u2192 on. But it was off.\n\n- Step12: 0 present \u2192 on. This matches.\n\nBut step1 is a contradiction. Unless the rule requires at least two objects. Then:\n\n- Step1: one object (0) \u2192 off.\n\n- Step6: four objects (including 0) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: three objects (0,1,2) \u2192 off (because even though 0 is present, maybe it's not about count).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try another angle. The key tests are:\n\n- When 0 is added alone after step11, it turns on (step12). But when added alone initially (step1), it didn't. What's the difference? The only difference is that in step12, 3 was previously on and then removed. Maybe the machine requires that 3 has been on the machine at least once before? That seems unlikely, but perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if 0 is present and 3 has been on at some point. But the problem states that the rule is based on current state, not history.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on when the sum of the indices of the objects on it is even. Let's check:\n\n- Step1: 0 \u2192 0 is even \u2192 on. But step1 shows off.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, the machine is on if any blicket is present. If 0 is a blicket:\n\n- Step1: 0 present \u2192 on. But step1 off. Contradiction.\n\nIf 3 is a blicket:\n\n- Step5: 3 present \u2192 on. But step5 shows off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blickets are 0 and 3. The machine turns on when at least one of them is present. Then:\n\n- Step1: 0 present \u2192 on. But step1 off.\n\nContradiction. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly one of the blickets is present. If 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- Step12: 0 alone \u2192 exactly one \u2192 on.\n\n- Step6: both present \u2192 two \u2192 off. But step6 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think about mutual information. A blicket is an object whose presence affects the machine's state. So, if adding or removing the object changes the machine's state, given other objects' states, then it's a blicket.\n\nLooking at step11: when 0 is removed (from 0 and 3), the machine turns off. So the presence of 0 was keeping it on. Thus, 0 has an effect \u2192 blicket.\n\nSimilarly, step7: removing 3 turns it off. So 3 has an effect \u2192 blicket.\n\nBut when 0 is added alone in step12, it turns on. So 0's presence alone affects the machine. But in step1, adding 0 alone didn't. That's confusing. But perhaps in step1, the machine's state wasn't updated correctly, or there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if there's an odd number of blickets on it. If 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- Step1: 1 blicket (0) \u2192 odd \u2192 on. But step1 off.\n\n- Step6: 2 blickets \u2192 even \u2192 off. But step6 on.\n\nSo contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the machine is on if at least one blicket is present. Then:\n\n- Step1: 0 present \u2192 on. But off.\n\nContradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it's on if exactly one of 0 or 3 is on. But step6: both on \u2192 off. But step6 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list all cases where the machine is on and off and see which objects are present.\n\nMachine on:\n\n- Step6: 0,1,2,3 on.\n\n- Step8: 0,1,2,3 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: 0,3 on.\n\n- Step12: 0 alone.\n\nMachine off:\n\n- Step1: 0 alone.\n\n- Steps3-5: adding 1, 2, 3 (each time off).\n\n- Step7: 0,1,2 on.\n\n- Step11: 3 alone.\n\nSo, when the machine is on, the common factor is the presence of 0. Except step1, where 0 is present but it's off. However, in step12, 0 alone turns it on. So why the difference?\n\nAh, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when object 0 is present and the total number of objects is even. Let's check:\n\n- Step1: 0 present, count 1 (odd) \u2192 off.\n\n- Step6: count 4 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: count 2 (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step12: count 1 (odd) \u2192 off. But step12 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, the machine turns on when object 0 is present and another object (any other) is also present. So:\n\n- Step6: 0 and others \u2192 on.\n\n- Steps9-10: 0 and 3 \u2192 on.\n\n- Step12: 0 alone \u2192 off. But step12 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the machine turns on when object 0 is present and object 3 is not. But in steps9-10, 3 is present and it's on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in steps9-10, after removing 1 and 2, the machine has 0 and 3, and it's on. If the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present, then:\n\n- Steps9-10: on.\n\n- Step12: 0 alone \u2192 off. But step12 shows on. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the machine is on if 0 is present, regardless of others. But step1 contradicts this. Unless there's a different rule after certain actions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine has a toggle effect. Every time an object is added or removed, it toggles. But that doesn't fit the data.\n\nAnother angle: mutual information. For an object to be a blicket, the machine's state must depend on it. So, we need to see if the presence of the object affects the machine's state, given the other objects.\n\nLet's look at object 0:\n\n- When 0 is added to 1,2,3 (step6), the machine turns on. So adding 0 made it on, implying 0 is a blicket.\n\n- When 0 is removed from 0 and 3 (step11), the machine turns off. So removing 0 caused it to turn off, implying 0 is a blicket.\n\n- When 0 is added alone (step12), the machine turns on. So adding 0 alone caused it to turn on, implying 0 is a blicket.\n\nBut in step1, adding 0 alone didn't turn it on. This inconsistency is confusing. However, the mutual information is about the current state, not historical. So even if in one scenario the machine is off when 0 is present, but in other scenarios it's on, it could still mean that 0's presence is correlated with the machine's state.\n\nBut to calculate mutual information, we need to consider all possible configurations. Let's list all observed configurations and whether 0 is present:\n\nMachine on:\n\n- 0,1,2,3: on.\n\n- 0,3: on.\n\n- 0 alone: on.\n\nMachine off:\n\n- 0 alone: off.\n\n- 1,2,3: off.\n\n- 0,1,2: off.\n\n- 3 alone: off.\n\nSo, when 0 is present, the machine is on in 3 cases and off in 2. When 0 is absent, the machine is off in 2 cases. So there's some correlation. But mutual information requires that the presence of 0 gives information about the machine's state.\n\nThe mutual information between 0's presence and the machine's state is non-zero. Let's compute it:\n\nThe probability that the machine is on when 0 is present: 3/5.\n\nThe probability that the machine is off when 0 is present: 2/5.\n\nThe probability that the machine is on when 0 is absent: 0/2.\n\nThe overall probability of the machine being on: 3/7.\n\nThe mutual information would be non-zero because knowing that 0 is present increases the probability of the machine being on. Thus, 0 is a blicket.\n\nSimilarly, for object 3:\n\nWhen 3 is present, machine is on in 3 cases (all four, 0 and 3, 3 alone?) Wait, when 3 is present:\n\n- All four: on.\n\n- 0,3: on.\n\n- 3 alone: off.\n\nSo when 3 is present, machine is on 2 times and off 1 time.\n\nWhen 3 is absent:\n\n- 0,1,2: off.\n\n- 0 alone: on (step12) and off (step1).\n\nSo mutual information here is less clear. But considering step12, when 3 is absent and 0 is present, the machine is on. But in step1, 0 present and 3 absent: off. So the presence of 3 is not necessary for the machine to be on. Therefore, 3's presence may not be a blicket.\n\nBut based on the key steps:\n\n- Adding 3 to 0,1,2 (step8) turns it on, implying that 3 is a blicket.\n\n- Removing 3 from all four (step7) turns it off.\n\n- Adding 3 back turns it on.\n\nSo, 3's presence seems to affect the machine's state. Thus, both 0 and 3 are blickets.\n\nBut the question is specifically about object 0. Based on the mutual information, even though there's inconsistency in step1, the majority of cases show that 0's presence is correlated with the machine being on. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket."}

From the interactions, I need to recall when the machine turned on or off based on the objects placed.\n\nFirst, when all objects (0,1,2,3) were placed on the machine, the light turned on. Then, when object 3 was removed, the light went off. But when 3 was put back, the light came on again. Then, when objects 1 and 2 were removed one by one, the light stayed on. Only when object 0 was removed did the light turn off. Also, when only object 0 was placed, the light came on. So it seems like object 0 is definitely a blicket because putting it alone activates the machine. \n\nNow, when objects 1 and 2 were on the machine along with 0 and 3, removing 1 didn't turn the machine off. The machine stayed on even after taking 1 and 2 off, as long as 0 and 3 were there. Then, removing 0 turned it off. This suggests that object 1's presence isn't necessary for the machine to stay on. Therefore, object 1 isn't a blicket because its state (on or off the machine) doesn't affect the machine's state. The rule might be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. Since object 0 alone works, and 3 was involved when added, but when 3 was removed and only 0 was there, it still worked. Wait, in the step where 0 and 3 were both on, removing 3 turned it off, but putting 0 back on made it turn on again. Hmm, maybe there's a different rule. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWhen the user put all four objects on the machine, the light turned on. Then, when they took object 3 off, the light went off. Then putting object 3 back turned it on again. Then, removing object 1 and 2 while keeping 0 and 3 on the machine kept the light on. Then taking 0 off turned it off. So when only 0 and 3 were on, the light was on. When 0 was removed, it turned off. But when 0 was placed alone, the light came on. So maybe object 0 is a blicket, and object 3 is also a blicket. Because when both were present, removing 3 made it turn off. But when 0 was alone, it worked. Wait, but when all four were on, the light was on. Then removing 3 made it off. So maybe the machine requires at least one of the blickets. But 0 and 3 are blickets. Because when they are both present, removing one (3) leaves 0, which is a blicket, so the machine should stay on. Wait, but in the interaction, when they took 3 off, the light went off. That suggests that when 3 was removed, even though 0 was on the machine, the light turned off. But later, when 0 was put on alone, the light turned on. That's a contradiction unless there's a different rule. Let me check the steps again:\n\nStep 1: Put 0 on machine \u2192 light off. So initial placement of 0 didn't activate.\n\nThen, after placing all 1,2,3 on machine (so 0,1,2,3 on machine) \u2192 light was off. Then adding 0 again (already on machine?), maybe a typo. Wait, the steps are:\n\n- User puts object 0 on machine. Light is off.\n\nThen takes 0 off. Light remains off.\n\nThen puts 1, 2, 3 on machine. Light still off.\n\nThen puts object 0 on machine again (so now all four are on machine) \u2192 light turns on.\n\nSo the machine turns on when all four are on? But then taking object 3 off causes the light to go off. Then putting 3 back on turns it on again. Then taking 1 and 2 off (so objects 0 and 3 are on machine) \u2192 light stays on. Then taking 0 off \u2192 light turns off.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me reconstruct the exact steps:\n\n1. put 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n2. take 0 off \u2192 light off.\n\n3. put 1 on \u2192 light off.\n\n4. put 2 on \u2192 light off.\n\n5. put 3 on \u2192 light off. So all four are on machine now. Wait, no. Wait, steps after taking 0 off (step 2):\n\nAfter step 2: objects 1,2,3 are on floor. Then steps 3-6:\n\n3. put 1 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n4. put 2 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n5. put 3 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nSo after these steps, objects 1,2,3 are on machine. Then step 6:\n\n6. put object 0 on machine \u2192 light turns on.\n\nSo all four objects on machine \u2192 light on.\n\nThen step 7: take 3 off \u2192 light off. So now objects 0,1,2 on machine. Light off.\n\nStep 8: put 3 back on \u2192 light on. Now all four again. Light on.\n\nStep9: take 1 off \u2192 light remains on. Now objects 0,2,3 on machine.\n\nStep10: take 2 off \u2192 light remains on. Now objects 0 and 3 on machine.\n\nStep11: take 0 off \u2192 light off. Now only 3 on machine.\n\nStep12: put 0 on \u2192 light on (only 0 and 3 on machine).\n\nSo from this, the machine turns on when both 0 and 3 are on. But wait, when they took 0 off (step11), leaving 3 on \u2192 light off. Then putting 0 back on (step12) \u2192 light on. So when 0 is on and 3 is on, light is on. But when only 0 is on (earlier steps?), no. Wait, in step1: put 0 on \u2192 light off. Then in step12: put 0 on when 3 was already on \u2192 light on. So maybe the rule is that the machine requires both 0 and 3 to be on. So they are both blickets.\n\nBut how to explain step6: when all four are on \u2192 light on. Then removing 3 (step7) \u2192 light off. Then adding 3 back (step8) \u2192 light on. Then removing 1 and 2 (steps9-10) \u2192 light stays on. So with only 0 and 3 on, light is on. So the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present. So those are the blickets.\n\nThen, object 1 and 2 are not blickets. Because their presence or absence doesn't affect the machine once 0 and 3 are on. So the answer for object 1 is False."}

From what I remember, a blicket is an object that affects whether the machine turns on. The key is mutual information between the object's state (on or off the machine) and the machine's state.\n\nLooking at the actions taken and the machine's responses:\n\n1. When objects 1, 2, and 3 were all placed on the machine, the light was off. Then adding object 0 turned it on. That suggests that maybe the combination of all four didn't work, but adding 0 made a difference. Wait, no, when they put 0 on again after that, the machine turned on. Wait, let's retrace the steps.\n\nThe initial steps: \n\n- Put 0 on machine: light off.\n- Took 0 off, then put 1, 2, 3 on: light still off. Then added 0 again, and the light turned on. So with 0,1,2,3 on, the machine is on. Then when they took 3 off, the light went off. Then put 3 back on, light on. Then took 1 and 2 off (leaving 0 and 3 on), light stayed on. Then took 0 off (only 3 left), light turned off. Then putting 0 back on alone turned it on.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, when 0 was placed alone: light off. Then taken off. Then 1,2,3 added: light off. Then 0 added (so all four on), light on. Then remove 3: light off. Add 3 again: light on. Then remove 1 and 2: light stays on. Then remove 0: light off. So when only 0 and 3 were on (after removing 1 and 2), the machine stayed on. Removing 0 then turned it off.\n\nSo maybe the machine turns on when both 0 and 3 are on. Let's see:\n\n- When 0 and 3 are on, machine is on. When either is removed, it turns off. For example, after adding 0,1,2,3: machine on. Taking 3 off makes it off. Adding 3 back makes it on again. Then taking 1 and 2 off (leaving 0 and 3) keeps it on. Then taking 0 off (only 3) turns it off. Then adding 0 back (only 0) turns it on. Wait, that last step: when they put 0 back on after taking it off (so 0 alone on machine), the light turned on. So maybe the machine turns on when 0 is present, regardless of others? But earlier when 0 was alone, it was off. Wait, no, first step:\n\n- The first time, putting 0 on the machine alone: light off. Then after adding 1,2,3 (so all on except 0?), no, wait initial steps:\n\nWait, initial steps:\n\n- User put object 0 on machine: light off. Then took 0 off.\n\nThen put 1,2,3 on machine: light still off. Then put 0 on machine (so all four on): light turns on.\n\nThen took 3 off: light off. Put 3 back on: light on.\n\nThen took 1 and 2 off (so objects 0 and 3 on machine): light remains on.\n\nThen took 0 off (only 3 on machine): light off.\n\nPut 0 back on (only 0 on machine): light on.\n\nWait, this is contradictory. When 0 is alone, first time: light off. Then later, after 0 was part of a combination, putting 0 alone makes it on. So maybe the rule changed? Or perhaps there's a different rule. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets, and 0 and 3 are the blickets. Let's check:\n\nWhen 0 and 3 are both on the machine, the light is on. If only one is on, it's off. Let's see:\n\nAfter putting 0,1,2,3 on: light on. Taking 3 off leaves 0,1,2: light off. So without 3, even with 0,1,2, it's off. Then putting 3 back (so 0,1,2,3 on) turns it on again. Then taking 1 and 2 off (leaving 0 and 3) keeps it on. Taking 0 off (only 3) turns it off. Then putting 0 on alone: light on. But earlier, when 0 was alone, it was off. That's inconsistent unless there's a different rule. Wait, maybe the machine turns on when the number of blickets on it is odd. Suppose 0 and 3 are blickets. Then:\n\nFirst time 0 alone: 1 blicket (odd) \u2192 should turn on. But in the first step, putting 0 on machine: light off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on. Then, if 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\nPutting 0 on (a blicket) should turn it on. But in the first step, putting 0 on: light off. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the machine requires all blickets to be on. If there are two blickets, 0 and 3, then:\n\nWhen 0 and 3 are both on, machine is on. If either is missing, it's off. Let's test:\n\n- When 0,1,2,3 are on: both 0 and 3 are present \u2192 machine on. Take 3 off: 0 is present but 3 is not \u2192 machine off. Put 3 back \u2192 both present \u2192 on. Take 1 and 2 off (0 and 3 still on) \u2192 machine on. Take 0 off (only 3) \u2192 machine off. Then putting 0 back (0 alone) \u2192 machine on? Wait no, because 3 is off. Wait, when they put 0 on after that, the machine turns on. But according to this rule, if the machine requires both 0 and 3 to be on, then putting 0 alone should not turn it on. But in the last step, putting 0 alone turned it on. So this contradicts the previous pattern. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on. Then 0 and 3 are blickets. So when 0 is on, machine on. But in the first step, putting 0 on: machine off. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is on. Let's see. Suppose 0 and 3 are blickets. Putting 0 on (only 0): machine on. But in the first step, putting 0 on: machine off. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if the sum of some property (like weight) meets a threshold. But given the actions, it's more likely a logical combination.\n\nLooking back at the steps:\n\n1. Put 0 on \u2192 off.\n\n2. Take 0 off.\n\n3. Put 1, 2, 3 on \u2192 off.\n\n4. Put 0 on (all four on) \u2192 on.\n\n5. Take 3 off (0,1,2 on) \u2192 off.\n\n6. Put 3 back on \u2192 on.\n\n7. Take 1 off (0,2,3 on) \u2192 on.\n\n8. Take 2 off (0,3 on) \u2192 on.\n\n9. Take 0 off (3 on) \u2192 off.\n\n10. Put 0 on (0 on) \u2192 on.\n\nWait, step 10: putting 0 alone now turns it on, but step 1, putting 0 alone turned it off. That's inconsistent unless there's a different rule. Maybe the machine's state depends on the order of operations? Or perhaps the machine's rule is that it's on if an even number of blickets are present. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is triggered by a specific combination. Let's list when the machine was on:\n\n- When 0,1,2,3 are on (step 4: after adding 0 to 1,2,3 \u2192 on).\n\n- When 3 was added again (step 6: 0,1,2,3 \u2192 on).\n\n- After taking 1 and 2 off (0 and 3 remain \u2192 on).\n\n- After taking 0 off (only 3 \u2192 off).\n\n- Putting 0 back \u2192 on (step 10: 0 alone \u2192 on).\n\nWait, that's conflicting because in step 1, putting 0 alone \u2192 off, but step 10, putting 0 alone \u2192 on. How can that be?\n\nAh, maybe there's a hidden state in the machine. But according to the problem statement, the machine's state is determined solely by the current configuration of objects. So the same configuration should have the same result.\n\nBut in step 1, object 0 alone \u2192 off. Then in step 10, object 0 alone \u2192 on. That's impossible unless the machine's rule changed, which it shouldn't. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the steps.\n\nWait, let me recheck the logs:\n\nThe user's actions and responses:\n\n1. put object 0 on the machine \u2192 light off.\n\n...\n\nThen later, after various steps:\n\nThey took object 0 off the machine (so machine has 3 on). Then put object 0 on again \u2192 light on.\n\nSo when they put 0 on alone, after having had 0 and 3 on before, it turned on. But initially, putting 0 alone didn't. That's a contradiction unless the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it's on if at least two blickets are present. Let's assume objects 0 and 3 are blickets. Then:\n\n- 0 alone: 1 blicket \u2192 off.\n\n- 0,3: 2 \u2192 on.\n\n- 3 alone: 1 \u2192 off.\n\n- 0,1,2,3: 2 \u2192 on (since only 0 and 3 are blickets).\n\nBut when they put 0 on after taking 3 off (so 0 alone), the machine turned on. That would contradict this rule. Unless there's another blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe object 0 is a blicket, and the machine turns on when it's present, but initially, there was a mistake. Wait, let's see:\n\nStep 1: put 0 on \u2192 off.\n\nStep 4: after adding 0 to 1,2,3 \u2192 on. Then removing 3 (0,1,2) \u2192 off. Adding 3 back \u2192 on. Then removing 1 and 2 (0,3) \u2192 on. Then removing 0 (3) \u2192 off. Then adding 0 \u2192 on (0 alone).\n\nSo when 0 is alone at step 10, it's on. But in step 1, it was off. That suggests that the machine's state depends on something else. Unless the machine's rule is that it's on if object 0 is present and an even number of other objects are present. But that's too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it's on if exactly one blicket is present. Then, if 0 is a blicket:\n\n- Step 1: 0 alone (1 blicket) \u2192 on. But the machine was off. So that's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine turns on when the total number of blickets on it is even. If 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- Step 1: 0 on \u2192 1 (odd) \u2192 off. Correct.\n\n- Step 4: 0,1,2,3 on \u2192 2 blickets (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step 5: take 3 off \u2192 1 blicket (0) \u2192 off.\n\n- Step 6: put 3 back \u2192 2 \u2192 on.\n\n- Step 7: take 1 off (0,2,3) \u2192 2 \u2192 on.\n\n- Step 8: take 2 off (0,3) \u2192 2 \u2192 on.\n\n- Step 9: take 0 off (3) \u2192 1 \u2192 off.\n\n- Step 10: put 0 on \u2192 1 \u2192 off. But according to the log, it turned on. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's think again.\n\nThe key observations are:\n\n- When all four objects are on the machine, it's on.\n\n- Removing 3 (leaving 0,1,2) \u2192 off. Adding 3 back \u2192 on.\n\n- Removing 1 and 2 (leaving 0 and 3) \u2192 on.\n\n- Removing 0 (leaving 3) \u2192 off.\n\n- Putting 0 back alone \u2192 on.\n\nBut initially, putting 0 alone \u2192 off. So the only difference is that in the first case, 0 was placed alone, then removed. Later, after being part of a combination, putting 0 alone works. This suggests that the rule isn't purely based on the current state. That can't be. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in recalling the steps.\n\nWait, let me check the exact logs again:\n\nThe user's actions:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n2. take 0 off.\n\n3. put 1,2,3 on \u2192 light off.\n\n4. put 0 on (now all four on) \u2192 light turns on.\n\n5. take 3 off \u2192 light off.\n\n6. put 3 on \u2192 light on.\n\n7. take 1 off \u2192 light on.\n\n8. take 2 off \u2192 light on.\n\n9. take 0 off \u2192 light off.\n\n10. put 0 on \u2192 light on.\n\nSo after step 10, 0 is alone on the machine, and the light is on. But in step 1, 0 alone was off. That's a contradiction unless the rule isn't just about which objects are present but perhaps their order or some other factor. But the problem states the rule is a hidden rule based on the objects on the machine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine's rule is that it turns on if object 0 is on the machine, regardless of others. But in step 1, 0 was on and the light was off, which contradicts that.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on when the sum of the objects' IDs on it is even. Let's see:\n\nStep 1: 0 \u2192 sum 0 (even) \u2192 should be on. But light was off. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the machine is on if at least one of the blickets is present, but the initial blicket was 0 and 3. But in step 1, 0 was present and light was off. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine requires that all blickets must be on. If there are two blickets, say 0 and 3:\n\n- When both are on \u2192 on.\n\n- If one is missing \u2192 off.\n\nBut in step 4, all four are on (including 0 and 3) \u2192 on. Step 5: take 3 off \u2192 0 on, 3 off \u2192 off. Step 6: put 3 back \u2192 on. Step 7: take 1 off (0,2,3 on) \u2192 both blickets present \u2192 on. Step 8: take 2 off (0,3 on) \u2192 on. Step 9: take 0 off \u2192 3 alone \u2192 off. Step 10: put 0 alone \u2192 only 0 on \u2192 off, but according to the log, it turned on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. The only way step 10 makes sense is if 0 alone turns it on, but that contradicts step 1. Unless the machine's rule changed, which it shouldn't. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in their log? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- After putting 0,1,2,3 on, light is on.\n\n- Take 3 off \u2192 light off.\n\n- Put 3 back \u2192 light on.\n\n- Take 1 off \u2192 light on.\n\n- Take 2 off \u2192 light on.\n\n- Take 0 off \u2192 light off.\n\n- Put 0 on \u2192 light on.\n\nSo when 0 is put back on alone, the light is on. But initially, putting 0 alone didn't turn it on. This inconsistency suggests that the rule is not simply based on the presence of 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if the number of blickets on it is odd. Let's say 0 and 3 are blickets:\n\n- Step 1: 0 alone \u2192 1 (odd) \u2192 on. But log says off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that it turns on if exactly one blicket is present. Then:\n\n- Step 1: 0 \u2192 on. But log says off. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the machine's rule is that it turns on if any blicket is present along with at least one other object. So 0 is a blicket. When 0 is alone, it's off. But when 0 is with others, it's on. Let's test:\n\nStep 1: 0 alone \u2192 off.\n\nStep 4: 0 with 1,2,3 \u2192 on.\n\nStep 6: 0,3,1,2 \u2192 on.\n\nStep 7: 0,2,3 \u2192 on.\n\nStep 8: 0,3 \u2192 on.\n\nStep 10: 0 alone \u2192 off. But log says on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if object 0 is present and at least one other object. Then:\n\n- Step 1: 0 alone \u2192 off.\n\nStep 4: 0 with others \u2192 on.\n\nStep 8: 0 and 3 \u2192 on.\n\nStep 10: 0 alone \u2192 off. But log says on. Contradiction.\n\nThis is perplexing. Let's consider another angle. The key is mutual information. An object is a blicket if the machine's state depends on it. So we need to check for each object whether changing its presence affects the machine's state, given the others.\n\nLooking at object 2:\n\nWhen was object 2 on or off, and how did the machine respond?\n\nIn step 3, after putting 1,2,3 on (machine off). Adding 0 (all four) turns it on. So the presence of 0 changes the state. So 0 is a blicket.\n\nThen, after step 8, when 0 and 3 are on (after removing 1 and 2), the machine is on. Taking 0 off (only 3) turns it off. So 3 is also a blicket.\n\nWhat about object 2? Let's see:\n\nWhen object 2 was removed (step 8), the machine stayed on (from step 7 to 8: removed 2, machine remained on). So removing object 2 didn't affect the machine's state when 0 and 3 were present. So object 2's presence or absence doesn't influence the machine's state when 0 and 3 are on. Therefore, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nSimilarly, when object 1 was removed (step 7), the machine stayed on. So object 1 isn't a blicket either.\n\nThus, the blickets are 0 and 3. Object 2 is not a blicket."}

So, the definition says a blicket is an object where its state (on or off the machine) isn't independent of the machine's state. So their mutual information is non-zero. Basically, the presence of the blicket on the machine affects whether the machine turns on.\n\nLooking at the steps taken:\n\n1. When all four objects (0,1,2,3) were placed on the machine, the light turned on. Then when object 3 was removed, the light turned off. But when object 3 was added back, the light turned on again. So maybe object 3 is part of the required set.\n\nWait, but there's more. When object 0 was placed alone on the machine, the light turned on. Then later, after removing objects 1,2,0, when object 0 was placed again, the light came on. So object 0 alone seems to activate it. But when objects 1,2,3 were on the machine without 0, the light was off. Then adding 0 made it on. So maybe object 0 is a blicket. Then when all four were on, maybe the combination requires at least one blicket. Wait, but when object 0 is on, it's on. Then when 3 was added again, but after removing 0 and others, putting 0 back made it on again. So maybe object 0 is a blicket. But what about object 3?\n\nWait, let's look at specific interactions involving object 3. \n\nFirst, when objects 0,1,2,3 were all on the machine, the light was on. Then when object 3 was taken off, the light turned off. Then putting object 3 back made the light turn on again. So when object 3 was removed, the machine turned off, but when it was added back, it turned on. But that might be because the presence of object 3 is necessary. But wait, when the user first put objects 1,2,3 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding object 0 turned it on. So in that case, object 0's presence activated it. Then when object 3 was removed, the light turned off. But at that point, the machine had objects 0,1,2. Wait, no: the initial steps were:\n\n- Put 0 on: light off.\n- Take 0 off.\n- Put 1 on: light off.\n- Put 2 on: light off.\n- Put 3 on: light off.\n- Then put 0 on: light turns on.\n\nSo when all four are on, the light is on. Then removing 3: light off. Then adding 3 back: light on. So in that scenario, with objects 0,1,2,3 on, removing 3 caused the light to go off. But earlier, with 0,1,2,3 all on, the light was on. So maybe the rule requires all objects to be on the machine. Wait, but then when they added 0 again, after putting 0 on alone, the light turned on. Wait, that's confusing. Let's retrace the steps:\n\nInitial state: all objects on floor.\n\nStep 1: put 0 on machine. Light off.\nStep 2: take 0 off. Light still off.\nStep 3: put 1 on. Light off.\nStep 4: put 2 on. Light off.\nStep 5: put 3 on. Light off. (So now all 1,2,3 are on machine, 0 is on floor.)\nStep 6: put 0 on machine. Now all four are on. Light turns on.\nStep 7: take 3 off. Now objects 0,1,2 are on machine. Light turns off.\nStep 8: put 3 back on. Now all four on again. Light turns on.\nStep 9: take 1 off. Now 0,2,3 on machine. Light stays on.\nStep 10: take 2 off. Now 0 and 3 on machine. Light stays on.\nStep 11: take 0 off. Now only 3 on machine. Light turns off.\nStep 12: put 0 on. Light turns on.\n\nSo when only 0 is on the machine, the light is on. When 0 is on along with others, the light is on. But when 0 is not on the machine, even if others are (like 3), the light is off. So this suggests that object 0 is a blicket. Because the machine's state (on/off) depends on whether 0 is present. \n\nBut what about object 3? Let's see. When the machine was on with all four objects, removing 3 caused it to turn off. But when 3 was removed, the machine had objects 0,1,2. But if the rule is that the machine is on if object 0 is present, then even with 0,1,2, the machine should stay on. But in step 7, when 3 was removed (leaving 0,1,2 on), the light turned off. Wait, that contradicts the earlier idea. Because in step 6, putting 0 on (with 1,2,3 already on) made the light turn on. Then when removing 3, the machine turns off. So perhaps the rule is that all four objects must be on the machine. But then why does putting 0 on alone in step 12 turn it on? That's a contradiction. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's check the steps again:\n\nStep 6: put 0 on the machine (others 1,2,3 already on). Light turns on.\n\nStep 7: take 3 off. Light turns off.\n\nSo with 0,1,2 on, light is off. But then in step 12, after removing all except 0, putting 0 on makes light on. So that's inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if exactly one blicket is present. But then, when 0 is on alone, it's on. When 0 and others are on, it's on. But when 0 is off, even if others are on, it's off. So maybe object 0 is the only blicket. But then why when all four are on and 3 is removed, the light turns off. Wait, in step 6, when all four are on, the light is on. Then removing 3 (so 0,1,2 on), the light turns off. But according to the previous idea, if 0 is the blicket, then the light should remain on as long as 0 is present. So this contradicts that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when the number of objects on it is even. Let's check:\n\nIn step 6, four objects (even) \u2192 on. Step 7, three objects (odd) \u2192 off. Step 8, four \u2192 on. Step 9, three \u2192 off? But in step 9, after taking 1 off, the machine has 0,2,3 \u2192 three objects. But the light stays on. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on when at least one blicket is present. If 0 is a blicket, then when 0 is on the machine, it's on. When 0 is off, it's off. But in step 6, after adding 0 (blicket) to 1,2,3 (non-blickets), machine turns on. Then removing 3 (non-blicket) leaves 0,1,2. Since 0 is present, machine should stay on. But in step 7, after removing 3, the light turns off. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on only when all blickets are on. Suppose there are multiple blickets. For example, 0 and 3. So if both are on, machine is on. If either is missing, machine is off. Let's test this:\n\nStep 6: all four on. If 0 and 3 are blickets, then machine is on. Step 7: remove 3. Now 0 is on, 3 is off. So machine should turn off. Which matches. Then step 8: add 3 back. Now both 0 and 3 on \u2192 machine on. Step 9: remove 1. 0,2,3 on. So 0 and 3 are present \u2192 machine on. Correct. Step 10: remove 2. 0 and 3 on \u2192 machine on. Step 11: remove 0. Only 3 on \u2192 machine off. Step 12: add 0. Now 0 on \u2192 but 3 is off. So according to the rule, if both need to be present, machine should be off. But in step 12, putting 0 alone makes the machine turn on. So that contradicts. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if exactly one blicket is present, and that blicket is 0. Then:\n\nWhen 0 is on alone: on.\n\nWhen 0 is on with others (non-blickets): on.\n\nWhen 0 is off: off.\n\nBut in step 7, after removing 3, the machine had 0,1,2. According to this, machine should be on. But step 7 says the light turned off. So that's a problem. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on when an odd number of blickets are present. Suppose there are two blickets: 0 and 3. Then:\n\nIn step 6: four objects on. Both blickets (0 and 3) \u2192 even (2) \u2192 machine off? But step 6 says machine on. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on when at least one blicket is present. If 0 and 3 are blickets, then when either is on, machine is on. But when 0 is on and 3 is off (step 12), machine is on. When 0 is off and 3 is on (step 11: only 3 on after taking 0 off), machine is off. So that suggests that 3 is not a blicket. Because having 3 alone doesn't activate the machine.\n\nBut earlier steps complicate this. For example, when all four are on (including 0 and 3), machine is on. Remove 3 (now 0,1,2 on). Machine turns off. So that would suggest that 3 is necessary. But then when 3 is removed, and 0 is present, machine is off. So maybe 0 and 3 are both blickets, and both need to be present. But when 0 is alone, machine is on. That's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if the total number of blickets on the machine is odd. Suppose blickets are 0 and 3. Then:\n\n- Step 6: two blickets on \u2192 even \u2192 machine off. But step 6 says machine on. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at the steps again:\n\nKey observations:\n\n1. Putting 0 on the machine alone (after others were on and then taken off) turns the machine on (step 12). So 0 alone activates it. Therefore, 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. When all four are on (including 0), machine is on. Remove 3 (now 0,1,2 on). Machine turns off. But 0 is a blicket, so why did it turn off? Unless there's another condition.\n\nWait, maybe the machine's state depends on the presence of a specific combination. For example, the machine requires exactly object 0 and 3 to be on. Let's see:\n\n- Step 6: 0,1,2,3 \u2192 on. If the rule is 0 and 3 must be present, then removing 3 (step 7) leaves 0,1,2 \u2192 machine off. Adding 3 back (step8) \u2192 machine on. Then removing 1 (step9) leaves 0,2,3 \u2192 machine on. So that works. Then removing 2 (step10) leaves 0,3 \u2192 machine on. Removing 0 (step11) leaves 3 \u2192 machine off. Then putting 0 back (step12) \u2192 machine on. So in this case, the rule is that both 0 and 3 must be present. So both are blickets.\n\nBut when 0 is put alone (step12), the machine turns on. But according to this rule, 3 must also be present. So this is a contradiction. Unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if any blicket is on, but if any non-blicket is also on, it requires all non-blickets to be off. Wait, that's getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on when the sum of the object numbers is even. Let's test:\n\nObject numbers are 0,1,2,3.\n\nIn step 6: sum 0+1+2+3=6 (even) \u2192 machine on. Step7: sum 0+1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 machine off. Step8: sum 6 again \u2192 on. Step9: sum 0+2+3=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 machine should be off. But in step9, machine stays on. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: in step12, putting 0 alone turns it on. So 0 is a blicket. When 0 is on, machine is on. But when 0 is on with others, but in step7, 0 is on but machine is off. So that's a problem. So why in step7, when 0 is on, the machine is off?\n\nWait, step6: after putting 0 on (with 1,2,3 already on), the machine turns on. Then step7: take 3 off. Now 0,1,2 are on. Machine turns off. But 0 is a blicket. So why is the machine off?\n\nThis suggests that the presence of certain other objects affects the machine. Maybe the rule is that the machine is on if exactly one blicket (object 0) is on. So if multiple objects are on, even including 0, it's off. But in step6, all four are on, and machine is on. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on only if object 0 is present and no other objects are present. But step6: machine is on with 0,1,2,3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine is on when object 0 is present, but only if it's alone. But in step6, it's on with others. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Let's look at all steps again:\n\nAfter initial steps:\n\n- Put 0 on, light off. Take 0 off.\n\n- Put 1,2,3 on. Light off.\n\n- Put 0 on. Light on. So when 0 is added to the existing 1,2,3, light turns on. So maybe the rule is that the machine is on if at least one blicket is present. But in this case, when 0 is added, it turns on. So 0 is a blicket. Then, when 0 is present with others (1,2,3), light is on. Then taking 3 off (so 0,1,2 on), light turns off. But if 0 is a blicket, why did it turn off? That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different rule: the machine is on if all objects on it are blickets. If 0 is the only blicket, then when 0 is alone, machine on. When 0 is with others (non-blickets), machine off. But in step6, when all four are on (0,1,2,3), machine is on. But if only 0 is a blicket, the machine should be off. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the machine is on if the number of blickets is greater than or equal to 1, but only if they are the only ones on. So if any non-blicket is also on, the machine turns off. So:\n\n- 0 alone: on.\n\n- 0 with others: off.\n\nBut in step6, 0 is added to 1,2,3 \u2192 machine on. Which would require that there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine is on if the sum of the blickets' numbers is even. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nLet me think differently. The key is mutual information between the object's state and the machine's state. So for object 3, when it's on the machine, does the machine's state (on/off) depend on it?\n\nLet's see the interactions involving object 3:\n\n- When objects 0,1,2,3 are on, machine is on. Remove 3 \u2192 machine off. Add 3 back \u2192 machine on. So in that case, the presence of 3 affects the machine's state. But when 3 is added back, the other objects (0,1,2) are already on. So perhaps the machine is on only when all four are on. But then why does putting 0 alone later make it on?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine is on when object 0 is present and object 3 is also present. Let's test:\n\n- Step6: 0 and 3 on \u2192 machine on. But others are also on. Step7: 0 on, 3 off \u2192 machine off. Step8: 0 and 3 on \u2192 machine on. Step9: 0 and 3 on, others off \u2192 machine on. Step12: 0 on, 3 off \u2192 machine on. But this contradicts because in step12, machine turns on even though 3 is off.\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: when object 3 is on the machine, does the machine's state change based on that? Let's look at when object 3 is added or removed:\n\n- Step5: put 3 on (others 1,2 on). Light off.\n\n- Step6: put 0 on. Now all four on. Light on.\n\n- Step7: take 3 off. Light off.\n\n- Step8: put 3 on. Light on.\n\n- Step9: take 1 off. Light stays on.\n\n- Step10: take 2 off. Light stays on.\n\n- Step11: take 0 off. Light off.\n\n- Step12: put 0 on. Light on.\n\nSo when 3 is present along with 0, the light is on. But when 0 is alone, light is on. When 0 and 3 are present without others, light is on. But when 0 is present with others (like 1,2) but 3 is removed, light is off. That's confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the machine is on if object 0 is present and the total number of objects is even. Let's check:\n\n- Step6: four objects (even) \u2192 on.\n\n- Step7: three (odd) \u2192 off.\n\n- Step8: four \u2192 on.\n\n- Step9: three \u2192 off (but light stays on). Contradiction.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: determine which objects' presence or absence directly correlates with the machine's state.\n\nObject 0:\n\n- When added to 1,2,3 \u2192 machine turns on.\n\n- When removed (step11) \u2192 machine turns off.\n\n- When added alone (step12) \u2192 machine turns on.\n\nThis suggests that object 0 is a blicket because its presence correlates with the machine being on.\n\nObject 3:\n\n- When added back in step8, machine turns on (but 0 was already present).\n\n- When removed in step7, machine turns off (but 0 was present).\n\nSo, when 3 is removed while 0 is present, the machine turns off. But when 0 is present without 3, the machine is off. But in step12, 0 is present without 3, and the machine is on. This inconsistency suggests that there's another factor.\n\nWait, in step7, after removing 3, the objects on the machine are 0,1,2. Light turns off. But in step12, putting 0 alone turns it on. So why does the presence of 1 and 2 affect the machine's state when 0 is present?\n\nThis suggests that the rule might require that only blickets are on the machine. If non-blickets are present, the machine won't activate even if a blicket is there. So if objects 0 is a blicket, and 1,2,3 are non-blickets, then the machine is on only when 0 is present and no non-blickets are present. But in step6, all four are on, which includes non-blickets 1,2,3. But the machine is on. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine is on if at least one blicket is present, regardless of other objects. But then, in step7, when 0 is present with 1,2, the machine should be on. But it's off. So this can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the machine is on only when exactly one blicket is present and no others. But step6 has four objects, which would have one blicket (0) and others, but machine is on. So that's not.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's try to list all the scenarios where the machine is on or off, and see which objects are present:\n\n1. All four (0,1,2,3) \u2192 on.\n\n2. 0,1,2 \u2192 off.\n\n3. 0,1,2,3 \u2192 on (step8).\n\n4. 0,2,3 \u2192 on (after removing 1).\n\n5. 0,3 \u2192 on (after removing 2).\n\n6. 3 \u2192 off (after removing 0).\n\n7. 0 \u2192 on.\n\nSo, machine is on when:\n\n- All four are on.\n\n- 0,2,3 are on.\n\n- 0,3 are on.\n\n- 0 alone is on.\n\nMachine is off when:\n\n- 0,1,2 are on.\n\n- 3 alone is on.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the machine is on whenever object 0 is present and the total number of objects on the machine is odd. Let's check:\n\n- All four (even) \u2192 on. Doesn't fit.\n\n- 0,1,2 (3 objects, odd) \u2192 off. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine is on when object 0 is present and the number of objects is even. Let's test:\n\n- All four (even, 0 present) \u2192 on. Yes.\n\n- 0,1,2 (3, odd) \u2192 off. Yes.\n\n- 0,2,3 (3, odd) \u2192 should be off. But in step9, machine is on. So contradiction.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAnother approach: find which objects' presence is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\nFrom step12: object 0 alone \u2192 on. So object 0 must be a blicket.\n\nFrom step7: 0,1,2 \u2192 off. But 0 is present. So why is it off? Maybe because certain combinations of objects are required. For instance, if the machine is on only when 0 is present and at least one other blicket is also present. If object 3 is also a blicket, then:\n\n- 0 alone \u2192 off. But step12 shows it's on. Contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine is on when object 0 is present and the number of other objects is even. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the machine is on when object 0 is present and the total number of objects is even. Let's check:\n\n- Step6: four (even) \u2192 on. Correct.\n\n- Step7: three (odd) \u2192 off. Correct.\n\n- Step8: four \u2192 on. Correct.\n\n- Step9: three (0,2,3) \u2192 odd \u2192 off. But in step9, the light stays on. So contradiction.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: The machine's rule is that it turns on if object 0 is on, regardless of others. But then why in step7, when 0 is on with 1 and 2, the light turns off?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe there's a time component. Like, when you add or remove objects, the machine updates its state based on the current configuration. But according to the steps:\n\n- Step6: put 0 on (others already on) \u2192 light on.\n\n- Step7: take 3 off \u2192 light off.\n\nSo, in step7, after removing 3, the machine has 0,1,2. But if 0 is a blicket, the machine should be on. So why is it off?\n\nThis suggests that the presence of other objects (non-blickets) affects the machine. So perhaps the rule is that the machine is on if exactly one blicket is present and no other objects. But then step6 contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that the machine is on if object 0 is present and no other objects are present. But in step6, other objects are present, but machine is on.\n\nThis is a puzzle. Maybe there's a hidden rule that's not obvious. Let's try to look for patterns.\n\nWhen 0 is on the machine, the light is on in these cases:\n\n- All four on.\n\n- 0,2,3 on.\n\n- 0,3 on.\n\n- 0 alone on.\n\nBut when 0 is on with 1 and 2, the light is off. What's the difference between those scenarios? The presence of object 3.\n\nSo when 0 is present and object 3 is also present, the light is on. When 0 is present without 3, the light is off. But in step12, 0 is alone and the light is on. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, step12: after removing all objects, putting 0 on \u2192 light on. So in that case, 0 is present and 3 is not. So the light is on. But earlier, when 0 was present with 1 and 2 (step7), light was off. So the presence of 1 and 2 must be the issue. But how?\n\nMaybe the rule is that the machine is on if object 0 is present and either object 3 is present or no other objects are present. So:\n\n- 0 alone \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 with 3 \u2192 on.\n\n- 0 with others (but not 3) \u2192 off.\n\nThat would explain step7 (0,1,2 \u2192 off), step8 (0,1,2,3 \u2192 on), step9 (0,2,3 \u2192 on), step12 (0 alone \u2192 on).\n\nIf this is the case, then object 0 is a blicket and object 3 is a blicket. Because the presence of 3 affects the machine's state when 0 is present.\n\nBut how to confirm this. Let's see:\n\n- When 0 is present and 3 is present, machine on.\n\n- When 0 is present and 3 is absent, machine off unless no other objects are present.\n\nWait, in step12, 0 is present alone \u2192 on. According to this rule, that's allowed. So the rule would be: machine is on if object 0 is present and (object 3 is present or no other objects are present).\n\nSo if object 0 is on the machine, and either 3 is also on or there are no other objects, then the machine is on. Otherwise, it's off.\n\nThis would require that both 0 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine is on if 0 is present and either 3 is present or no other objects are present. \n\nBut how to test this with the given steps:\n\n- step6: 0,1,2,3 \u2192 0 and 3 are present. So machine on.\n\n- step7: remove 3 \u2192 0,1,2. Since 3 is absent and there are other objects (1,2), machine off.\n\n- step8: add 3 back \u2192 0,1,2,3 \u2192 on.\n\n- step9: remove 1 \u2192 0,2,3 \u2192 on.\n\n- step10: remove 2 \u2192 0,3 \u2192 on.\n\n- step11: remove 0 \u2192 3 \u2192 off.\n\n- step12: add 0 \u2192 0 alone \u2192 on.\n\nThis fits. So according to this rule, both 0 and 3 are blickets. Because the machine's state depends on both. Object 0 is necessary, but when 0 is present, the presence of 3 or the absence of other objects determines the state.\n\nBut according to the definition, a blicket is an object whose state is not independent of the machine's state. So object 3's presence does affect the machine's state when 0 is present. For example, when 0 is present with 1 and 2, adding 3 turns the machine on. So object 3's state is not independent of the machine's state. Therefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBut wait, in step12, when 0 is alone, the machine is on. So the presence of 3 isn't required there. But that's because the rule allows for 0 to be alone. So in that case, the machine's state depends on 0. But when 0 is present with others, the presence of 3 determines the state. So both 0 and 3's states are correlated with the machine's state. Hence, both are blickets.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is a blicket."}
