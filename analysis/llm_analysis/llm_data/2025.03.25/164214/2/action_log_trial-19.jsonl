I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. The machine starts with all objects on the floor. The commands I can use are look, put objects on the machine or floor, take them off, and exit. \n\nFirst, maybe I should start by putting one object on the machine to see if it activates. Since there are four objects, testing each one individually could help identify which ones are blickets. But that might take too many steps. Wait, but maybe the rule isn't just a single object. Maybe it's a combination. Hmm.\n\nLet me try putting object 0 on the machine first. If the machine turns on, then object 0 is a blicket. If not, maybe it's not. So the command would be 'put 0 on machine'. Let me try that.\n\nWait, but after putting 0 on the machine, I need to check the machine's status. So maybe after each action, I should look again to see if the light is on. Alternatively, the system might tell me after each action whether the machine's state changes. But according to the initial prompt, after each command, the environment responds. So when I put an object on the machine, the description might mention if the light turns on.\n\nSo first step: put object 0 on the machine. Then, after that, check the machine's state. If the light is on, then 0 is a blicket. If not, then maybe not. Then take it off and try the next one.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it, or maybe it requires all blickets to be on. Or maybe a specific number. So testing one by one could help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two blickets are on it. But since there are four objects, I need to test different combinations.\n\nBut given the limited steps (32), I should be efficient. Let's start with testing each object individually.

There are four objects here: 0, 1, 2, and 3, all on the floor. The machine's light is off. My goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nFirst, I tried putting object 0 on the machine, but initially, I made a mistake by typing \"put 0 on machine\" which wasn't recognized. Then I corrected it to \"put object 0 on machine\" and succeeded, but the light stayed off. So object 0 alone doesn't activate the machine. Maybe it's not a blicket, or maybe the rule requires more than one object.\n\nNow, I need to test other objects. Let's try putting another object on the machine. Maybe object 1. If I add object 1 and the machine turns on, then either 0 and 1 together are needed, or one of them is a blicket. But if the light still doesn't come on, then perhaps neither 0 nor 1 are blickets, or the rule is different, like needing a specific number or combination.\n\nSo the next step should be to add object 1 to the machine and see what happens. If the light turns on, that gives a clue. If not, maybe try adding another object. Alternatively, I could test each object individually first. Wait, but when I put object 0 on alone, it didn't work. Maybe individual objects don't trigger it. Let's try object 1 by itself.\n\nWait, no. The initial state had all objects on the floor. So when I put object 0 on the machine, it's the only one there. If object 0 were a blicket, but the rule requires more than one, then adding another might help. Alternatively, the rule could be that the machine activates when any blicket is present, but maybe some objects are non-blickets. So maybe object 0 isn't a blicket. Let me test object 1 alone.\n\nBut since I already have object 0 on the machine, maybe I should first remove it. Wait, but the commands are to put and take. So perhaps I should take object 0 off the machine and try putting another object. But maybe combining objects is better. Let's think: if I put object 0 and object 1 on the machine, does that trigger it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly two blickets are present. Or maybe it's an OR condition where any blicket being present activates it. But since putting object 0 alone didn't work, maybe 0 isn't a blicket. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine next. Let's see what happens when I add object 1 to the machine while object 0 is already there."}

So the machine's light turned on when I placed object 2 on it. But before that, I had objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, I tried to put 0 on the machine, but the response was \"0 is not a recognized object.\" Oh right, maybe I need to use \"object 0\" instead of just the number. Then I put object 0 on the machine, and the light was off. Then added object 1, still off. Then added object 2, and the light turned on. So when I added object 2, the machine activated. \n\nHmm, so maybe object 2 is a blicket. But what's the rule? It could be that having at least one blicket on the machine makes it turn on. But in that case, maybe object 2 is the only blicket. Or maybe the rule is that all blickets need to be on the machine. Let's think. If I had objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine and the light came on when adding 2, then perhaps 2 is a blicket and the others are not. But maybe there's another rule, like needing exactly two blickets. Wait, but when I put 0 and 1 on, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So maybe the presence of 2 is sufficient. Let's test that hypothesis.\n\nBut to confirm, maybe I should remove some objects. For example, if I remove object 2, does the light stay off? Let's try that. Take object 2 off the machine. If the light turns off, that would support that 2 is a blicket. Alternatively, if the rule is that all blickets need to be on, but maybe there's more than one. Wait, but when I added 2, the light came on. So if 2 is a blicket, the rule could be that at least one blicket is present. But perhaps there are multiple blickets, and their combination is needed. But in this case, adding 2 triggered the light. Let's see: with 0,1 on, adding 2 turned it on. So maybe 2 is a blicket, and the others are not. But maybe 0 and 1 are not blickets. However, another possibility is that the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed. For example, maybe 1 and 2 are blickets. But when I had 0 and 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So if 1 and 2 are blickets, then when both are present, the machine turns on. But when 1 was added alone, it didn't. So maybe the rule is that the presence of two or more blickets activates the machine. Wait, but in that case, if 1 and 2 are blickets, adding 1 first didn't activate, then adding 2 would make two blickets, so light on. That's possible. Or maybe the rule is that any blicket's presence activates it, but perhaps 0 and 1 are not blickets, and 2 is. But then why did the light come on when adding 2? Because 2 is a blicket. Then, if I remove 2, the light should go off. Let's check that.\n\nBut I need to proceed step by step. Let's try taking off object 2. If the light turns off, that would confirm that 2 is a blicket. Let's do that next."}

That suggests that object 2 is a blicket, and maybe the rule requires at least one blicket to be on the machine. But wait, when I had objects 0 and 1 on the machine first, the light was off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. So maybe 2 is a blicket and the others aren't. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nWait, but could the rule be that exactly one blicket is needed, and 2 is the only one? Or maybe the rule is that all blickets need to be on the machine. But there are 4 objects. Let me test further. What if I put object 2 back on and see if the light comes on again. Then try combining it with others. Maybe the rule is that the machine activates when at least two blickets are present, but since adding 2 alone made it work, perhaps 2 is a blicket and maybe another one. Hmm, but when I added 2, it turned on. So if 2 is the only one, then the rule is having 2 on the machine. But I need to check other combinations. Let's see.\n\nLet me try putting object 3 on the machine. If the light doesn't turn on, maybe 3 isn't a blicket. Then if I put 2 and 3 together, if the light stays on, maybe 2 is the only one.

Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on it, but in the previous step, putting 0, 1, and 2 on the machine, the light came on when adding 2 (so three objects).

So the presence of 2 seems crucial. Maybe 2 is a blicket, and the others are not. But what if there's a combination? For example, maybe the machine requires that at least one blicket is present, and 2 is the only blicket. So if I put 2 alone, does the machine light up? Let's check that.

Let me try putting 2 alone on the machine. Let's do that now. So next command: put object 2 on machine again.

The goal is to identify which objects are blickets and determine the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nSo far, the user has interacted with the environment a bit. Let me recap the steps they took and the outcomes.\n\nFirst, they tried putting object 0 on the machine, but the machine's light stayed off. Then they added object 1, still no light. Adding object 2 turned the light on. Then they took object 2 off, the light turned off. Putting object 2 back on turned it on again. Then they added object 3 while object 2 was on the machine, and the light stayed on. Then they took object 2 off, leaving object 3 on the machine, and the light remained on.\n\nHmm. Let's analyze this. When object 2 was placed alone, the light came on. Then adding object 3 didn't change the state\u2014light stayed on. But when they removed object 2, leaving object 3, the light stayed on. That suggests that object 3 might also be a blicket. Wait, but initially, when object 3 was placed after object 2, the light was already on. Maybe the rule isn't just having at least one blicket. Let's see:\n\nPossible rules could be:\n\n1. The machine activates if any blicket is present (OR rule).\n2. It requires a specific combination, like a certain number of blickets (AND rule).\n\nBut let's look at the sequence:\n\n- 0 and 1 on machine: light off. So neither 0 nor 1 are blickets.\n- Adding 2: light on. So 2 is a blicket.\n- Adding 3: light stays on. If 3 is a blicket, that's consistent. But when they remove 2, leaving 3, the light stays on. That suggests 3 is also a blicket. So maybe both 2 and 3 are blickets. Then why does the machine stay on when only 3 is present?\n\nWait, after putting 2 on, light on. Then adding 3, light on. Then remove 2, leaving 3: light remains on. So that would mean 3 alone is a blicket. So 2 and 3 are both blickets. But what about the initial test with 0 and 1? They don't trigger the machine. So possible rule: at least one blicket on the machine. But that would mean that 2 and 3 are blickets. But let's check again.\n\nWait, when object 3 was added to the machine (which already had 2 on it), the light stayed on. Then when 2 was removed, the light stayed on. So 3 alone can keep the machine on. Therefore, 3 is a blicket. Similarly, 2 is a blicket because when it was placed alone, the machine turned on. So the rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. Therefore, objects 2 and 3 are blickets. But let's confirm this.\n\nWait, the user also tried putting 3 on the machine after 2 was already there. Then when they took 2 off, leaving 3, the light remained on. So that confirms that 3 is a blicket. Similarly, 2 alone works. So the rule is OR: any blicket on the machine turns it on. The blickets are 2 and 3. But wait, let's make sure there's no other rule. For example, maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets or something else. Let's check the steps again:\n\n- 0 and 1 on machine: no effect. So they are not blickets.\n- Adding 2: light on. So 2 is a blicket.\n- Adding 3: light remains on. If 3 is a blicket, that's fine. But if 3 isn't, adding it doesn't change the state. But when 2 is removed, leaving 3, the light stays on. Therefore, 3 must be a blicket. So the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. Therefore, the blickets are 2 and 3. But wait, what if the rule is that the machine turns on when exactly two objects are on it, but both 2 and 3 are blickets? No, because when 2 was alone, it activated the machine, so that's not the case. So the rule is OR.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Let's see if the user has tested other combinations. They haven't tried putting 3 alone yet. Wait, the user put 3 on after 2 was already there, so 3 was added to the machine with 2. Then they removed 2, leaving 3. The light stayed on. So that means 3 alone works. So 3 is a blicket. Similarly, 2 alone works, so 2 is a blicket. 0 and 1 don't work when placed alone or together. So the rule is that the machine activates if any of the blickets (2 or 3) are on it. Therefore, the answer should be that objects 2 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is the machine activates when at least one blicket is present.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different rule. For example, maybe the machine activates when the total weight of blickets is above a threshold, but that seems more complex. Since placing 2 alone works and 3 alone works, the simplest rule is OR. The user hasn't tested 3 alone yet, but when they removed 2, leaving 3, the machine stayed on. So 3 must be a blicket. Therefore, the conclusion is that 2 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is OR.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps the user should test putting 3 on the machine alone. Let's check the steps again. The user's steps:\n\nAfter putting 2 and 3 on, then removing 2, leaving 3, the light is on. So 3 alone is enough. Therefore, the user can be confident that 3 is a blicket. So the current state is that object 3 is on the machine, and the light is on. So the user might now try removing 3 to see if the light goes off. If the user takes object 3 off, the machine should turn off. Let's see what the next step should be.\n\nThe user's next action could be taking object 3 off the machine to see if the light turns off. If it does, that confirms that 3 is a blicket.\n\nBut in the last step, after taking object 2 off, the machine's light was still on with object 3. So the user might now take object 3 off to see if the light turns off. Let's think of the next command.\n\nThe user's next command should be 'take object 3 off machine' to test if removing 3 turns the light off.\n\nIf the light turns off, then 3 is definitely a blicket. If it remains on, there's something else. But according to the previous steps, when 3 was on the machine alone, the light was on. Taking 3 off would leave the machine empty, so the light should turn off. That would confirm that 3 is a blicket.\n\nSo the next step should be to take object 3 off the machine. Let's see what the user's current state is:\n\nAfter the last step, the user took object 2 off the machine, leaving object 3 on it. The light is on. So the machine has object 3 on it. Now, taking object 3 off would leave the machine empty. If the light turns off, that confirms that 3 is a blicket. So the next command should be 'take object 3 off machine' to check that.\n\nBut maybe the user has already done enough steps. They already have evidence that 3 alone keeps the machine on. So they might have already concluded that 2 and 3 are blickets. But to be thorough, they should test 3 alone. So the next step is to take 3 off and see if the light goes off. If yes, then 3 is a blicket. If not, there's something else.\n\nIn the current state, the machine has object 3 on it. The light is on. So taking 3 off would leave the machine empty. The user should do that to confirm."}

So, the goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. \n\nFirst, let's recap what's happened so far. When I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then adding object 2 turned it on. When I removed 2, the light went off again. Putting 2 back on turned it on again. Then adding object 3 kept the light on. But when I removed both 2 and 3, the light turned off. \n\nHmm. So maybe the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But wait, when I had both 2 and 3 on the machine, the light stayed on even after removing 2. Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, after putting 2 and 3 on the machine, the light was on. Then taking 2 off left the light still on. Then taking 3 off turned it off. So when I took 2 off while 3 was still on, the light stayed on. Then removing 3 turned it off. That suggests that object 3 alone can keep the light on. So maybe both 2 and 3 are blickets. Because when either is on the machine, the light is on. But when I had 0 and 1 on the machine, the light didn't turn on. So maybe 0 and 1 are not blickets, but 2 and 3 are. \n\nBut wait, when I first put 2 on the machine, the light turned on. Then adding 3 kept it on. Then removing 2 left 3 on, and the light stayed on. Then removing 3 turned it off. So that indicates that 3 is also a blicket. So the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. So the blickets are 2 and 3. But let me test this further. \n\nWait, what if the rule is that exactly two blickets are needed? No, because when only 2 was on, it worked. So that can't be. Or maybe the rule is that the presence of any blicket activates the machine. Then 2 and 3 are blickets. Because when either is on, the machine is on. \n\nBut let me test if 3 alone works. When I put 2 and 3 on, then remove 2, the light stayed on. So 3 alone keeps it on. But what if I try putting 3 on first? Wait, in the initial steps, I put 0,1, then 2, which turned it on. Then 3 was added. Then when 2 was removed, the light stayed on because 3 was there. Then removing 3 turned it off. So maybe 3 is a blicket. \n\nBut I need to check if 3 alone can turn it on. Let's try putting 3 on the machine by itself. Right now, all objects are on the floor. So the next step should be to put object 3 on the machine and see if the light turns on. If it does, then 3 is a blicket. If not, maybe there's a different rule. But according to the previous steps, when I added 3 after 2 was on, the light stayed on. Then taking 2 off left it on. So 3 must be a blicket. \n\nWait, but when I first put 0,1, then 2 turned it on. So 2 is a blicket. Then adding 3 didn't change the state. Then removing 2, the light stayed on because 3 was there. So that would confirm that 3 is also a blicket. So the rule is that having any blicket on the machine turns it on. Therefore, the blickets are 2 and 3. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let's test putting 3 on first. Since the current state is all objects on the floor. Let's do that. So the next command should be to put object 3 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, maybe there's another rule, like needing both 2 and 3. But wait, when 3 was on the machine along with 2, and then 2 was removed, the light stayed on. So that suggests 3 alone is sufficient. Therefore, putting 3 alone should turn it on. Let's test that now."}

So, the goal is to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the commands and responses given, let's recap what happened step by step.\n\nFirst, the user tried putting object 0 on the machine, but initially made a typo, then corrected it. The machine's light stayed off. Then they added object 1, still off. Added object 2, and the light turned on. Then they removed object 2, the light turned off. Putting object 2 back on turned it on again. Then adding object 3 kept it on. When they took object 2 off, the light stayed on, but removing object 3 after that turned it off. Then putting object 3 back on turned it on again.\n\nHmm. So the key observations here are: When object 2 was added, the light turned on. But when object 3 was added after 2, the light stayed on. Then, removing 2 left 3 on the machine, and the light remained on. Removing 3 then turned it off. So that suggests that object 3 alone can activate the machine. Wait, but when they first put object 3 on after 2 and 1 and 0 were already on, adding 3 made it stay on. But when they took 2 off, leaving 1, 0, and 3 on, the light stayed on. Then taking 3 off turned it off. Wait, but when they took 2 off, the machine was still on, but when they took 3 off, it turned off. So that suggests that object 3 is a blicket. Because when object 3 was on the machine, even without 2, the light was on. Wait, no: Let me check again.\n\nWait, after putting 0, 1, 2 on the machine, the light was on. Then they added 3, light stayed on. Then took 2 off, light stayed on. Then took 3 off, light turned off. So when 3 was on the machine along with others (0,1), after 2 was removed, the light was on. Then removing 3 made it turn off. That suggests that 3 is a blicket. But when they put 3 on the machine alone (after removing 2), did that happen? Let's see. Wait, after taking 2 off, the objects on the machine were 0,1,3. The light was on. Then taking 3 off leaves 0 and 1, which turned the light off. Then putting 3 back on (so objects 0,1,3) turned it on again. Wait, but maybe 3 alone is a blicket. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that any one of the blickets is sufficient. Let's see.\n\nWait, the initial steps: putting 0, 1, 2 on the machine. After putting 2, the light turned on. So perhaps 2 is a blicket. Then adding 3 didn't change the state. Then removing 2 (leaving 0,1,3) kept the light on. So maybe 3 is also a blicket. Then removing 3 (leaving 0 and 1) turned it off. So if 3 is a blicket, then when it's on the machine, the light should be on. But earlier, when they added 0,1,2, the light came on with 2. So 2 is a blicket. Then adding 3 (so 0,1,2,3) didn't change the state. Then removing 2 (so 0,1,3) kept the light on, which suggests that 3 is also a blicket. Then removing 3 (so 0,1) turned it off. Then putting 3 back (0,1,3) turned it on again. So 3 alone (with 0 and 1) can activate the machine. But when they first put 0 on the machine (alone), the light didn't turn on. Similarly, 1 alone didn't. So 3 must be a blicket. And 2 is a blicket. So the rule might be that the machine activates if at least one blicket is present. Because when 2 was on (with 0 and 1), it turned on. When 2 was removed but 3 was present (with 0 and 1), it stayed on. Then when 3 was removed, it turned off. So both 2 and 3 are blickets. \n\nWhat about object 0? When object 0 was first put on the machine (alone), the light didn't turn on. Then when 1 was added, still no. Then adding 2 turned it on. So 0 and 1 alone don't activate the machine. When 3 was added with 0,1,2, the light stayed on. Then removing 2, leaving 0,1,3, the light stayed on. So 3 is a blicket, and 0 and 1 are not. So the answer for object 0 being a blicket is False."}

So from the steps taken, let me recap what happened. \n\nFirst, the user put object 0 on the machine, but the light stayed off. Then they added object 1, still off. When object 2 was added, the light turned on. Then they took 2 off, light went off. Putting 2 back on turned it on again. Then adding object 3 kept the light on. But when they took 2 off while 3 was on, the light stayed on. Then removing 3 turned it off. Adding 3 again turned it on.\n\nHmm. So when objects 2 and 3 are on the machine together, the light stays on. But when only 3 is on, it also works. Wait, when they put object 3 on after 2, the light was on. Then removing 2 left 3 on and the light stayed on. So does that mean that object 3 alone can activate the machine? Because after taking 2 off, 3 was still there and the light was on. Then taking 3 off turned it off. So 3 alone works. Then when they put 3 back on, the light turned on again. So 3 is a blicket. Object 2 also seems to be a blicket because when it was placed alone, the light turned on. \n\nBut what about object 1? When they put 0, 1, and 2 on, the light turned on when 2 was added. But before that, with 0 and 1, the light was off. Adding 2 made it turn on. Then adding 3 (with 2 on) kept it on. Then removing 2 left 3, which kept it on. So 3 is a blicket. Object 1 was on the machine when 0 and 1 were there, but the light was off. So putting 0 and 1 didn't activate it, but adding 2 did. So 2 is a blicket. Then 3 alone can activate. So the rule might be that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket on it. The blickets are 2 and 3. Object 1 was on the machine with 0 and 1, but the light only turned on when 2 was added. So 1 is not a blicket. Therefore, the answer should be False."}

So, from the actions taken and the machine's responses, I need to recall what happened each time.\n\nFirst, when they put object 0 on the machine, the light stayed off. Then object 1 was added, still off. Then object 2 was added, and the light turned on. That suggests that object 2 might be a blicket because adding it caused the machine to activate. But wait, when they added object 3 later while object 2 was already on the machine, the light stayed on. Then when they removed object 2, leaving object 3, the light stayed on. Then when they removed object 3, the light turned off. Then putting object 3 back alone made the light come on again. \n\nHmm. So, object 3 alone activates the machine. But when object 2 was added initially, it activated the machine. But then when object 3 was added, the light stayed on. But when they took object 2 off, leaving object 3, the light stayed on. Then removing object 3 turned it off. So object 3 alone can activate it. But earlier, putting object 2 on with 0 and 1 didn't activate until 2 was added. Wait, let's retrace the steps:\n\n1. Put 0: machine off.\n2. Put 1: machine off.\n3. Put 2: machine on. So, at this point, objects 0,1,2 are on the machine. The machine turns on when 2 is added. So maybe object 2 is a blicket. But when adding 3 later, the machine stayed on. Then taking 2 off, leaving 0,1,3: machine on. Then taking 3 off, machine off. So putting 3 back alone makes it on. That suggests that 3 is a blicket. But what about 2?\n\nWait, when 2 was first added (after 0 and 1), adding 2 made the machine turn on. So that suggests that 2 is a blicket. But when 3 was added, the machine stayed on, which might mean 3 is also a blicket. But then, after removing 2, leaving 0,1,3, the machine stayed on. Wait, no: when they took 2 off, the machine was still on. Then they took 3 off, and the machine turned off. Then putting 3 back alone turned it on again. So object 3 alone can activate it. So 3 is a blicket. But why did the machine turn on when 2 was added?\n\nWait, when 0 and 1 were on the machine, adding 2 made it turn on. But if 2 is a blicket, then the machine would activate. But maybe the rule is that any single blicket activates it. But then, when 0 and 1 were on the machine (assuming they are not blickets), adding 2 (a blicket) would activate it. Then adding 3 (another blicket) would still keep it on. Then removing 2 leaves 3, so it stays on. Then removing 3, it turns off. So that would mean that 2 and 3 are blickets. But the question is specifically about object 2. So, if adding object 2 caused the machine to turn on, and removing it while 3 was present didn't turn it off, but removing 3 did, that suggests that both 2 and 3 are blickets. But wait, when object 2 was added and the machine turned on, that was with 0,1,2 on the machine. Then adding 3 kept it on. Taking 2 off left 0,1,3: machine on. So if 3 is a blicket, then the machine would stay on. Then when 3 was removed, machine off. Then putting 3 back alone turned it on. So 3 is definitely a blicket. But what about 2? When 2 was added to 0 and 1, the machine turned on. If 2 is a blicket, that makes sense. But could there be another rule, like needing exactly two blickets? Wait, no, because when 3 is alone, it works. So the rule must be that at least one blicket is on the machine. So if 3 is a blicket, then when 3 is on, the machine is on. But when 2 was added to 0 and 1, the machine turned on. So that would mean that 2 is a blicket. Because adding it caused the activation. But how do we know that 0 and 1 aren't part of the rule? For example, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when the total number of blickets is even, or some other condition. But given the interactions, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, machine on. Then adding 3 (another blicket), machine stays on. Then removing 2 (so only 0,1,3), machine stays on (since 3 is a blicket). Then removing 3, machine off. Then adding 3 alone, machine on. So 3 is a blicket. So 2 must also be a blicket because when it was added, the machine turned on. Unless the rule requires a certain combination, but the simplest rule is that any blicket present activates the machine. Therefore, both 2 and 3 are blickets. But the question is only about object 2. So the answer would be True."}
