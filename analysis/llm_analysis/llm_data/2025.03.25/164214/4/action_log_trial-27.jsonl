If the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it, then putting 1 on would activate it, and taking it off would deactivate. But what if the rule is different, like needing an even number or something else. Wait, but in the first case, putting 0 and 1 on (with 1 being a blicket) would activate it. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) leaves 1, so still on. Removing 1 turns it off. Then object 2 doesn't do anything. So maybe object 1 is a blicket, and the others aren't. But need to check the other objects.\n\nNext, I should test object 3. Let's put object 3 on the machine. If the light turns on, then 3 is a blicket. If not, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates when exactly one blicket is on it. Wait, but when object 1 was on alone, it worked. Let's test object 3 now.

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions, here's what happened:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n2. Put object 1 on machine \u2192 light turns on.\n3. Took object 0 off, left object 1 \u2192 light stays on.\n4. Took object 1 off \u2192 light turns off.\n5. Put object 2 on \u2192 light stays off.\n6. Put object 3 on \u2192 light turns on.\n\nHmm. So when object 1 was added, the light turned on. Then when object 1 was removed, it turned off. Similarly, adding object 3 turned it on. So maybe objects 1 and 3 are blickets. But wait, when object 0 and 1 were both on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it, but removing 1 turned it off. So maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. But then when object 3 was added alone, it turned on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket on it. But then, when object 2 was added alone, the light stayed off. So object 2 is not a blicket. So far, objects 1 and 3 seem to be blickets. But maybe there's another rule. Let's test combinations to see if it's additive or something else. For example, what if both 1 and 3 are on the machine? Or maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets? Wait, but when 1 was alone, it was on. When 3 was alone, it was on. So that doesn't fit an even number. Alternatively, maybe the machine is on when exactly one blicket is present. But that might not hold. Let's think. When 1 and 0 were on the machine, the light was on. But 0 is not a blicket, so maybe the presence of any blicket (regardless of others) makes it turn on. So in that case, the machine's rule is that if at least one blicket is on it, it turns on. So the blickets are 1 and 3. But let's verify. If I put both 1 and 3 on the machine, does the light stay on? Also, what if I put 0 and 1 on together? When I first put 0 on, the light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. Then removing 0 didn't affect it. So that suggests that 1 is a blicket. Similarly, putting 3 alone turns it on. So 3 is a blicket. But let's check if putting 2 and 3 together does anything. Wait, when I put 2 on, it stayed off. Then adding 3 turned it on. So maybe 3 is a blicket. So maybe the rule is that the machine is on if any blicket is on it, regardless of non-blickets. So the blickets are 1 and 3. But I need to confirm. Let me think of a test. If I put 1 and 3 on the machine together, the light should stay on. Also, if I remove one of them, it should stay on if the other is still there. Let's try that. Next step: put both 1 and 3 on the machine. Then take one off. Let's see. But maybe the user has limited steps. Alternatively, maybe I can confirm by putting 1 and 3 on, see if the light is on. Then take 1 off. If the light remains on (since 3 is still there), that would confirm that both are blickets. Alternatively, if the light turns off when taking 1 off, that would imply that maybe the rule requires both to be present. Wait, but previous steps: when only 1 was on, light was on. When only 3 was on, light was on. So if the rule is that the machine is on if any blicket is present, then having both should still keep it on. Let's try that. So next step, put object 1 on the machine again. Then check the light. Then put object 3 on as well. Then remove one. So let's proceed. But since steps are limited, maybe there's a more efficient way. Let's see. Current state: objects 2 and 3 are on the machine. The light is on. So if I take 3 off, the light should turn off (if 3 is a blicket). Let's try that. Wait, in the last step, the user put object 3 on the machine, and the light turned on. So current state: machine has 3 and 2. But object 2 was previously put on and the light was off. Then adding 3 turned it on. So 3 is a blicket, 2 is not. So if I take 3 off now, the machine would have only object 2, which is not a blicket, so the light should turn off. Let me check that. So the next command would be take object 3 off the machine. If the light turns off, that confirms 3 is a blicket. Alternatively, if the light stays on, that would suggest something else. But according to previous steps, when 3 was added to 2, the light turned on, implying that 3 is a blicket. Let's try that. So:\n\nCurrent objects on machine: 2 and 3. Light is on. Take object 3 off. The machine now has object 2. If the light turns off, then 3 is a blicket. If it stays on, then 2 is also a blicket, which contradicts previous observation. So I expect the light to turn off. Let's do that."}

So, the goal is to find out which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets are objects whose presence affects the machine's state. \n\nLet's recap the previous steps. When I put object 0 on the machine alone, nothing happened. Then adding object 1 turned the machine on. But when I took object 0 off, leaving just 1, the machine stayed on. Then removing 1 turned it off. So, object 1 seems important. \n\nNext, when I tried object 2 alone, the machine stayed off. Then adding object 3 turned it on. Taking 3 off made it turn off again. So object 3 might also be a blicket. But wait, when I put 3 on the machine alone, the machine turned on? Wait, no. Wait, the steps were: after putting 2 on (machine off), then adding 3 made it turn on. Then taking 3 off made it turn off. So when 3 was on with 2, the machine was on. But when 3 is removed, leaving 2, it's off. So perhaps the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But then, when 1 was on the machine alone, it worked. Similarly, 3 with 2, but 2 alone didn't. So maybe 1 and 3 are blickets. Then the rule is that the machine turns on if any blicket is on it.\n\nWait, but when 0 was placed first and then 1, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1) kept it on. Then removing 1 turned it off. So 1 is a blicket. Similarly, with 3: when 2 and 3 are on, machine is on. Taking 3 off (leaving 2) turns it off. So 3 is a blicket. But 2 and 0 are not. So maybe the blickets are 1 and 3. The rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. \n\nBut wait, let's test this hypothesis. Let's check if putting 1 and 3 together also works. Wait, I haven't tried that yet. Maybe I should try combining them. For example, put 1 on, then 3, see if the machine stays on when either is present. Or check if the machine is on when both are present. Wait, but the previous steps indicate that each of them alone activates the machine. So if the rule is \"at least one blicket is present\", then 1 and 3 are blickets. \n\nBut let me verify. When I put 0 on the machine first, then 1, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 (leaving 1) kept it on. So 1 alone is sufficient. Then putting 2 and 3 together: machine turns on. But 2 alone doesn't, 3 alone when put on (but when 3 was added to 2, it turned on. Wait, when I put 2 on the machine first, then 3. The machine was off when 2 was alone, then adding 3 turned it on. So 3 alone (with 2) made it on. But when 3 is removed, leaving 2, it's off. So 3 is a blicket. So perhaps the rule is that the presence of any blicket (1 or 3) will activate the machine. So the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\n\nBut to confirm, maybe I should test putting 3 alone. Because when I put 3 on the machine with 2, the machine turned on, but what if I put 3 alone? Let me try that. If I take all objects off and put 3 on the machine by itself, does the machine turn on? Let's check. \n\nCurrent state: all objects are on the floor. The machine is off. If I put 3 on the machine: the light should turn on if 3 is a blicket. Let me try that command."}

So object 3 seems to be a blicket too.\n\nWait, but when I put object 3 back on the machine alone, the light turned on. So that suggests that object 3 by itself can activate the machine. Similarly, object 1 alone activated the machine when added after object 0. But when object 0 was removed, the machine stayed on, so maybe the presence of any blicket is sufficient? Or maybe the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. Let's recap:\n\n- Object 0: When placed alone, machine stays off. When added with 1, machine turns on, but removing 0 leaves 1 on, machine stays on. So 0 isn't a blicket, 1 is.\n- Object 1: When placed after 0, turns machine on. Removing 1 turns it off. So 1 is a blicket.\n- Object 2: Placed alone, does nothing. Then adding 3 turns it on. Removing 3 turns it off. So 3 is a blicket, 2 is not.\n- Object 3: Placed alone, turns machine on. So 3 is a blicket.\n\nSo the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. The blickets are 1 and 3. But wait, when object 3 was placed alone, it worked. Same with object 1. So each of them individually can activate the machine. So the rule is that the machine activates if any blicket is on it. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 3. But let me check if there's any other possibilities. For example, maybe the machine requires an even number of blickets or something else. Let's see:\n\nWhen object 1 and 0 were on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 (non-blicket) left 1 (blicket) and it stayed on. Then removing 1 turned it off. So that fits. Similarly, with 3: putting 3 on alone works, removing it turns off. So the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket on the machine makes it turn on. So any time a blicket is on, regardless of others, the machine is on. If no blickets are on, it's off. Therefore, the blickets are 1 and 3. But wait, did we test all possibilities? Let me see:\n\n- Object 0: Tested alone and with 1. Alone didn't work. So not a blicket.\n- Object 1: Alone works (after adding to 0, but when 0 was removed, 1 was alone and machine stayed on). So yes.\n- Object 2: Placed alone, didn't work. Then with 3, it worked. But removing 3 turned it off. So 2 isn't a blicket.\n- Object 3: Alone works. So yes.\n\nSo the blickets are 1 and 3. The rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. To confirm, maybe test putting 1 and 3 together. But the user has limited steps. Alternatively, since the user already tested putting 3 on alone and it worked, and 1 alone, that's enough. So I think the answer is that objects 1 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. However, the user hasn't tested putting both 1 and 3 on the machine together yet. Let's check if that's necessary. If the rule is \"any blicket\", then adding both would still keep it on, but maybe the rule is different. But based on the current evidence, the rule seems to be that any blicket present turns it on. So I can probably conclude now. The next step might be to exit since the user has figured it out. But maybe to be thorough, check if there's any other possibility. For example, maybe the rule is that exactly one blicket is on. But when object 1 and 3 are both on, if the machine stays on, then the rule is any. If it turns off, then maybe the rule is exactly one. But given the previous steps, when 3 was added to 2 (non-blicket), the machine turned on. So if adding both 1 and 3, the machine should stay on. Let me try that. So next step would be to put 1 and 3 on the machine and see if the light stays on. Let's see the previous steps: user put 3 on alone, machine on. Then took 3 off, machine off. Then put 3 back on, machine on. So current state: object 3 is on machine, light is on. If user adds object 1 to the machine, then the light should stay on. Let's check that. But according to the previous steps, after putting 3 on, the light is on. If the user now puts 1 on, the machine would have 3 and 1. If the light remains on, that's consistent. If the light went off, that would be a different rule. But based on the previous observations, the rule is likely \"at least one blicket\". Therefore, adding 1 and 3 together should keep it on. So the user might want to test that, but maybe to save steps, they can exit now. But since they have 32 steps and used 8 so far, maybe it's worth checking. However, the current step after putting 3 on again (step 7) is that the machine is on. If I now put object 1 on the machine, the machine would have both 1 and 3. The light should stay on. Let's see: the user's last action was putting 3 on, and the light is on. So next command could be 'put object 1 on machine' to see. If the light stays on, then the rule is confirmed. If it turns off, then the rule is different. But according to the previous interactions, when object 1 was on the machine with 0 (non-blicket), removing 0 left 1 on and the machine stayed on. So the presence of a blicket is sufficient. Therefore, adding another blicket should keep it on. So after putting 1 on, the machine should remain on. But let's simulate that: \n\nIf user does 'put object 1 on machine' now, the machine has objects 3 and 1. Since both are blickets, the machine should stay on. If the user does that and the light stays on, then the rule is confirmed. If the light turned off, that would be conflicting. But based on previous steps, the rule is that the presence of any blicket turns it on. Therefore, adding more blickets should not affect it. Thus, the current blickets are 1 and 3, rule is at least one. So the user can exit now. Alternatively, maybe check if there's any other possibility. For example, maybe the rule is that the sum of blickets is odd or something. But no, in previous steps, putting one blicket on (1 or 3) turns it on. So the simplest rule is the presence of at least one blicket. Therefore, the answer is blickets 1 and 3, rule: machine on if any blicket is on. So the user can now exit."}

From the problem description, a blicket is an object whose state (being on the machine or not) has a non-zero mutual information with the machine's state.

So, the rule is that the machine turns on when there's a blicket on it. From the previous steps:\n\n- When I put object 0 and 1 on the machine, the light turned on. Then, removing object 0 kept the light on, but removing object 1 turned it off. That suggests that object 1 is a blicket because when it was removed, the machine turned off. Object 0 might not be a blicket since its removal didn't affect the light.\n\n- Then, when I tried objects 2 and 3. Putting object 2 on the machine didn't turn it on. But adding object 3 made the light come on. Then, removing object 3 turned it off. So, when object 3 is on the machine alone, the light is on. That implies that object 3 is a blicket because its presence is necessary for the machine to activate. Since the machine only turns on when a blicket is present, and object 3 alone activates it, it must be a blicket. Object 2 isn't a blicket because putting it alone didn't do anything. So, the rule seems to be that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. Since object 3 activates it alone, it's a blicket."}
