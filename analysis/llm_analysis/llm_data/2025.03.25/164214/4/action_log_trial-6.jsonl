Wait, but when I added 0, then 1, the machine was still off. Then adding 2 made it turn on. So perhaps the presence of object 2 is necessary. But what if there's an AND condition? Like 2 and another? Or maybe it's an OR condition where any of the blickets can activate it. But in that case, maybe 2 is the only one. Or perhaps it's a specific combination.\n\nWait, after putting 0, 1, 2 on the machine, the light is on. But what if the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are placed?

If the rule is that any blicket is present, then removing 2 would turn it off. If the rule is that all blickets must be present, but maybe there's only one. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets. Hmm.\n\nWait, the current state is objects 0,1,2 on the machine, light is on. Let me try taking off object 0 first. Take object 0 off. Then check if the light stays on. If the light remains on, then object 0 isn't a blicket. Then take off object 1. If the light stays on, then the only blicket is 2. If taking off 1 makes it stay on, but then taking off 2 would turn it off. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the presence of object 2 alone is sufficient. Let's test that.\n\nFirst, remove object 0: take 0 off. Then remove 1: take 1 off. If the light remains on with just 2 on the machine, then 2 is a blicket and the rule is that having it on the machine activates it. But in the initial steps, when only 0 and 1 were on, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So if after removing 0 and 1, leaving 2, the light stays on, then 2 is the sole blicket.

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets are objects that have a non-zero mutual information with the machine's state, meaning their presence affects whether the machine is on or off.\n\nFrom the previous steps, here's what happened:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine: light stays off.\n2. Add object 1: still off.\n3. Add object 2: light turns on.\n4. Remove object 0: light remains on.\n\nSo, when objects 0, 1, and 2 were on the machine, the light was off. Then adding object 2 made it turn on. But even after removing object 0, it stayed on. That suggests that object 2 might be a blicket. But wait, when I put object 2 on, the machine turned on. However, when I took object 0 off, the machine stayed on. So maybe the machine's state depends on the presence of certain objects in a specific way.\n\nWait, let me recheck the sequence:\n\n- After putting 0, 1, and 2 on, the machine turns on when object 2 is added. But initially, adding 0 and 1 didn't turn it on. So object 2's addition caused the machine to activate. Then, when removing object 0, the machine stayed on. That suggests that object 2 is a blicket, but maybe other factors are at play. Perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. But then, if object 0 was a blicket, removing it would have turned the machine off. Since removing 0 didn't turn it off, maybe 0 isn't a blicket. So 2 is a blicket. But what about 1 and 3?\n\nWait, after putting 0, 1, and 2 on, the machine was off until 2 was added. Wait, the third command was put object 2 on machine, which made the light turn on. So prior to that, objects 0 and 1 were on the machine. Then adding 2 turned it on. So that suggests that object 2 is a blicket. Then, removing object 0 (a non-blicket) didn't affect the machine's state. So the machine stayed on. But maybe the rule is that the presence of any blicket turns it on. So if 2 is a blicket, then having it on the machine would keep the light on. But what about object 3? We haven't tested it yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule requires a specific combination. For example, maybe two blickets are needed, or maybe a certain number. Let's see. Let's consider possible rules:\n\nPossible rules could be:\n\n1. Machine turns on if at least one blicket is present.\n2. Machine turns on if all blickets are present.\n3. Machine turns on if an even number of blickets are present.\n4. Machine turns on only when a specific blicket is present.\n\nIn the current case, adding object 2 made the machine turn on. So if the rule is that any blicket present turns it on, then object 2 is a blicket. Then, even if other non-blickets are present, the machine stays on as long as at least one blicket is there. But when object 0 was removed, the machine stayed on. So if 2 is a blicket, then even without 0, the machine remains on. So that supports the first rule.\n\nBut we need to check other objects. For example, if we remove object 2, does the machine turn off? Let's test that. If I take object 2 off, and the machine turns off, then that confirms that 2 is a blicket. If the machine stays on, maybe there's another blicket present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But in this case, when 2 was added, the machine turned on even though 3 wasn't on. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on when exactly one blicket is present. If 2 is the only blicket, then adding it would turn the machine on, and removing others (non-blickets) doesn't affect it.\n\nBut let's test further. Now, the current state is that objects 1, 2 are on the machine. The machine is on. Let's try taking object 1 off. If the machine stays on, that suggests that object 1 is not a blicket. If the machine stays on, then it's because object 2 is still there. Let's try that.\n\nSo the next step could be taking object 1 off. If the machine remains on, that confirms that object 2 is a blicket and the rule is that having at least one blicket turns it on. Then, to check object 3, we need to put it on the machine and see if it affects the state. Alternatively, maybe the rule is more complex, like needing two blickets. But when object 2 was added, the machine turned on even though there were other objects. Wait, when 0 and 1 were on the machine, adding 2 turned it on. So if 0 and 1 are not blickets, then adding 2 (a blicket) would trigger the machine. If the rule is \"at least one blicket\", then that would explain it. But if the rule is \"exactly one blicket\", then adding 2 would turn it on, and adding another blicket would turn it off. But we don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that the machine turns on when an odd number of blickets are present. But again, without knowing how many blickets there are, this is hard to test.\n\nSo, the next steps should involve testing the remaining objects. For example, put object 3 on the machine and see if the state changes. Then, remove objects to see the effect.\n\nCurrent state: objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, machine is on. Let me check:\n\nIf I take object 1 off, and the machine stays on, then 1 is not a blicket. Then, if I take object 2 off, the machine should turn off. That would confirm that 2 is a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, if I add object 3 and the machine stays on, maybe 3 isn't a blicket. If adding 3 causes the machine to turn off, then 3 might be a blicket in a rule that requires even number of blickets, but that's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's state depends on some other combination, like the presence of a specific object. For example, only object 2 is a blicket, so whenever it's on, the machine is on, regardless of others.\n\nSo, next steps:\n\n1. Take object 1 off machine. If machine stays on, then 1 is not a blicket. Then check if machine turns off when 2 is removed.\n\n2. Then, check object 3 by putting it on the machine. If the machine's state changes (turns off or remains on), that could give info.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nCurrent objects on machine: 0 was removed, so 1 and 2 are on. The machine is on.\n\nWait, no. Wait the initial steps were:\n\n- Put 0 on: off\n\n- Put 1 on: off\n\n- Put 2 on: on\n\nThen take 0 off: on\n\nSo currently, objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, machine is on.\n\nSo next, take object 1 off. Command: take object 1 off machine.\n\nIf the machine stays on, then object 1 is not a blicket. Then, take object 2 off. If machine turns off, then object 2 is the only blicket.\n\nThen, test object 3: put it on machine. If machine turns on, then 3 is a blicket. Otherwise, not.\n\nAlternatively, if after removing 1, the machine stays on, and then removing 2 turns it off, that confirms 2 is a blicket.\n\nSo let's start with taking object 1 off."}

So, the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets are objects that have a non-independent relationship with the machine's state.\n\nStarting from the initial state, all objects (0,1,2,3) were on the floor. The machine was off. Then, when I put object 0 on the machine, nothing changed. Then object 1 was added, still off. When I added object 2, the machine turned on. So adding object 2 caused the light to turn on. Then I took off objects 0 and 1, but the machine stayed on. That suggests that object 2 is a blicket because its presence on the machine is associated with the machine being on. However, when I took off 0 and 1, the machine remained on, which might mean that the presence of 2 alone is sufficient. But maybe there's more to the rule. \n\nWait, let's check the steps again. After putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light turned on. Then removing 0 and 1 didn't turn it off. So the machine stays on as long as 2 is there.

But when I added 0,1,2, the machine turned on. Then removing 0 and 1 left 2, so the machine stayed on. So perhaps 2 is a blicket and the machine turns on when any blicket is present. Let's see if other objects also affect it. Maybe object 3 is also a blicket. Let's try adding object 3 to see if the machine's state changes. Wait, right now, object 2 is on the machine, and the light is on. If I add object 3, does it stay on? If adding 3 doesn't turn it off, then maybe 3 isn't a blicket. Or if the rule is that any blicket present turns it on, then adding another blicket wouldn't affect it. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. But in the previous steps, when I added 2, the machine turned on. So maybe 2 is a blicket. Let's test removing 2 now. If I take object 2 off, the machine should turn off if it's the only blicket. Let me try that. \n\nWait, the current state after the last action: objects 0 and 1 are off the machine (they were taken off), and object 2 is still on the machine. The machine is on. So next step, I could take object 2 off to see if the light turns off. If it does, that confirms that object 2 is a blicket. Alternatively, if there's another object that's a blicket, maybe object 3. Let me check that. Let me first take object 2 off. So command would be 'take object 2 off machine'. If the light turns off, then 2 is definitely a blicket. If it stays on, maybe another object is also on the machine? Wait, no, after taking 0 and 1 off, only 2 was left. Then taking 2 off would leave none. So if the machine turns off, then 2 is a blicket. If not, then there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the rule is different. For example, the machine might stay on once activated until all objects are removed, but that seems unlikely. Let me try that. \n\nSo next action: take object 2 off machine. If the light turns off, then 2 is a blicket. If not, perhaps another object is still on the machine. Wait, in the previous steps, after putting 0,1,2 on, then taking 0 and 1 off, the machine remained on with 2. Then taking 2 off should leave the machine empty. If the light turns off, that confirms 2 is the blicket. Let's test that. But in the current step, after the user took 1 off, the light was still on. So now, if I take 2 off, the machine should have no objects. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a combination. For example, the machine turns on when both 2 and another are present. But when I added 2, the machine turned on. Wait, when the user put object 0, then 1, then 2 on the machine, the light turned on when 2 was added. So adding 2 caused the light to turn on. That suggests that 2 is the trigger. So taking it off should turn the light off. Let's check. So next command: take object 2 off machine. If the light turns off, then 2 is a blicket, and the rule is that the presence of at least one blicket turns it on. If it doesn't turn off, then maybe there's a different rule. But given that adding 2 turned it on, and removing others didn't affect it, it's likely that 2 is a blicket. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on when all blickets are on it. But that would require more testing. For example, if there are two blickets, then all must be on. But when 2 was added, the machine turned on, so that would imply that 2 is the only blicket. But maybe there are more. Let's check object 3. Let's put object 3 on the machine. If the light stays on, then maybe 3 isn't a blicket. If it turns off, that might indicate a different rule. But right now, the machine is on with 2. So adding 3 and seeing if the state changes. Alternatively, taking 2 off first. \n\nBut let's proceed step by step. Let's take object 2 off. If the light turns off, then 2 is a blicket. Then, we can check object 3. So the next command should be 'take object 2 off machine'."}

But when object 2 was added, the machine turned on.\n3. Removing object 0 and 1 didn't affect the light\u2014it stayed on. But when object 2 was removed, the light turned off.\n4. Then putting object 3 on the machine turned the light on again.\n\nSo, when object 2 was on the machine, the light was on. Removing it turned it off. Similarly, object 3 alone turned it on. That suggests that objects 2 and 3 are blickets. But wait, when objects 0 and 1 were placed first, they didn't activate the machine. Then adding 2 turned it on. Then even after removing 0 and 1, keeping 2 kept it on. Then removing 2 turned it off. Then putting 3 on turned it on again. So maybe the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. So each blicket individually can activate the machine. So 2 and 3 are blickets. Because 2's presence turned it on, and 3's presence also turned it on. Let me confirm.\n\nWhen objects 0,1,2 were on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving 2) kept it on. Removing 2 turned it off. Then adding 3 alone made it on. So it seems that either 2 or 3 being present is sufficient. So the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. Therefore, 2 and 3 are blickets. Let's test this hypothesis. What if I put 2 and 3 on the machine together? But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, in the current state, object 3 is on the machine and the light is on. If I put 2 back on, does it stay on? Let's check. But the user's steps so far are:\n\nAfter putting 3 on, the light is on. So, if the user takes 3 off, the light should turn off. But maybe there's a different rule. Alternatively, maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets. But in the previous steps, when 2 was on alone, it was on. Then 3 alone is on. So maybe each blicket contributes to activation. So the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is present. So 2 and 3 are blickets.\n\nTo confirm, maybe try putting 2 and 3 together. If the light stays on, that supports the rule. But since the user hasn't done that yet, maybe they should test that. But the user only has 32 steps. Let's see. Wait, the user has already used 7 steps (look, put 0, put 1, put 2, take 0, take 1, take 2, put 3). Now the current state is that object 3 is on the machine, and the light is on. So next step, maybe take object 3 off to see if the light turns off. If it does, then 3 is a blicket. Then put 2 back on, and see if it turns on again. That would confirm 2 as a blicket. Then perhaps check combinations. But given the limited steps, maybe the user can conclude now. But let's see.\n\nWait, when object 3 is on the machine, light is on. If they take it off, and the light turns off, then that confirms 3 is a blicket. Similarly, putting 2 back would turn it on. Let's try that.\n\nBut the user's next step is... the current state after putting object 3 on machine, light is on. The next command would be, perhaps, take object 3 off to see if the light turns off. If yes, then 3 is a blicket. Then put 2 on again to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the user already has enough data. Let's recap:\n\n- Putting 0 and 1: no effect. Then adding 2 turns it on. So 2 is a blicket. Then removing 0 and 1 (still 2 on) stays on. Removing 2 turns it off. Then putting 3 on turns it on. So 3 is also a blicket. So the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. So the blickets are 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer would be that objects 2 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when any blicket is placed on it. \n\nBut to be thorough, maybe check if 3 alone works. Since in the current step, 3 is on and the light is on. So taking 3 off should turn it off. Then putting 3 back on should turn it on again. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 3 on it, light is on. If the user takes 3 off, then the machine is empty. Light should turn off. Then put 3 back on, light turns on. Then take 3 off again, light off. Then put 2 on, light on. That would confirm that both 2 and 3 individually activate the machine, and 0 and 1 do not. \n\nBut the user has already done some steps. Let me check the previous steps again:\n\nAfter putting object 3 on the machine, the light turns on. So that's step 7. Then the user's next action would be to take object 3 off. Let's simulate:\n\n> take object 3 off machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\nThen, putting object 2 on again:\n\n> put object 2 on machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n\nThen take 2 off again, light turns off. So yes, that would confirm 2 as a blicket. Similarly, putting 3 on and off. So perhaps the user should perform these steps. But since the user has limited steps, maybe they can conclude now. However, the user might want to confirm that 0 and 1 are not blickets. Let's see: when objects 0 and 1 were on the machine (steps 1 and 2), the light was off. Then adding 2 (step 3) turned it on. Then removing 0 and 1 (steps 4 and 5) didn't affect the light. So 0 and 1 are not blickets. Therefore, the conclusion is that 2 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. So the next step would be to exit the game, but maybe the user wants to confirm once more. Alternatively, they can proceed to exit now. \n\nBut the user's next command after putting 3 on the machine was the last step. So the current state is machine has 3, light on. The user might take 3 off to see if light turns off. Let's proceed with that."}

So the goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. Blickets are objects that have a non-independent relationship with the machine's state, meaning their presence affects whether the machine is on or off.\n\nLet's recap the actions taken so far and the outcomes:\n\n1. Initially, all objects (0,1,2,3) are on the floor. Machine is off.\n2. Put object 0 on machine \u2192 light stays off.\n3. Added object 1 \u2192 still off.\n4. Added object 2 \u2192 light turns on.\n5. Removed object 0 \u2192 light remains on.\n6. Removed object 1 \u2192 light still on.\n7. Removed object 2 \u2192 light turns off.\n8. Then, put object 3 on machine \u2192 light on.\n9. Removed object 3 \u2192 light off.\n\nFrom this, when object 2 was added, the machine turned on. Even when removing 0 and 1, the machine stayed on until 2 was removed. Similarly, adding object 3 alone turned it on, and removing 3 turned it off. So objects 2 and 3 individually can activate the machine. \n\nBut wait, when 0 and 1 were on the machine along with 2, the machine was on. But removing 0 and 1 didn't affect it. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. So objects 2 and 3 are blickets because their presence alone activates the machine. \n\nBut let's test further. Let's try putting objects 0 and 1 together again to see if they ever activate the machine. Because in the initial steps, putting 0, then 1, then 2 activated it. But when 0 and 1 were on the machine alone (steps 2 and 3), the light was still off. So 0 and 1 might not be blickets. \n\nWait, when 2 was added to 0 and 1, the machine turned on. Removing 0 and 1 didn't affect it as long as 2 was there. Then removing 2 turned it off. Similarly, adding 3 alone turned it on. So 2 and 3 each can activate the machine by themselves. So the rule might be that the machine turns on if any blicket is present. So the blickets are 2 and 3. \n\nBut to confirm, maybe there's a different rule. For example, maybe the machine requires exactly two blickets. Wait, when object 2 was added, the machine turned on. Then adding 3 later when 2 was off might have been separate. Let's check:\n\nWhen object 2 was placed on the machine (step 4), the machine turned on. Then after removing all, adding 3 alone (step 8) turned it on. So each of them individually activate. So likely, the rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. Therefore, 2 and 3 are blickets, and 0 and 1 are not. \n\nTo be thorough, maybe check if combining 0 and 1 does anything. Because maybe they are blickets that require both to be present. Let's try putting 0 and 1 on the machine together. If the machine doesn't turn on, then they aren't. \n\nSo next step: put object 0 and 1 on the machine. Let's see:\n\nCurrent state after previous steps: all objects are off. So I need to put 0 and 1 on.\n\nWait, after the last action (taking 3 off), the machine is off. So now, if I put 0 and 1 on, does the machine stay off? That would confirm they aren't blickets. \n\nSo, let's try:\n\n> put object 0 on machine\n\nIf the machine stays off, then 0 isn't a blicket. Then put object 1 on machine. If it stays off, then neither 0 nor 1 are blickets. \n\nAlternatively, if putting both makes it turn on, but that's not what happened earlier. Wait, in the initial steps, when 0 and 1 were on, the machine was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So maybe the machine requires at least one of 2 or 3. \n\nBut to confirm, let's test. Let's put 0 and 1 on the machine now. If the machine remains off, then they aren't blickets. If it turns on, then perhaps the rule is different. \n\nSo the next commands could be:\n\nput object 0 on machine \u2192 machine stays off? Then put object 1 on machine \u2192 still off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires exactly one blicket. But when 2 and 3 are both on, does it stay on? Let's check.\n\nWait, in the previous steps, when 0,1,2 were on the machine, the light was on. Then removing 0 and 1 (leaving 2) kept it on. So that's consistent with 2 being a blicket. Then adding 3 alone also turns it on. So 2 and 3 are blickets. \n\nAnother possibility: maybe the machine requires an odd number of blickets. But since adding 2 alone or 3 alone activates it, and adding both would make it two (even), which would turn it off. But we haven't tested that yet. Let's check.\n\nPut object 2 and 3 on the machine. If the machine is on when both are present, then the rule is at least one. If it's off, then it's an odd number. \n\nBut currently, after the last step, all objects are off. So let's try:\n\n1. Put object 2 on \u2192 light on.\n2. Then put object 3 on \u2192 if light stays on, then rule is at least one. If it turns off, then odd number. \n\nBut in the previous steps, when 2 was on, adding 3 wasn't tried. Let's simulate that. \n\nSo next possible steps:\n\n> put object 2 on machine \u2192 light on.\n\nThen, put object 3 on machine \u2192 if light remains on, then the rule is \"any blicket present\". If it turns off, maybe the rule is XOR (exactly one). \n\nBut given the initial steps, when 2 was on and others added, the light stayed on. So adding 3 would not turn it off. \n\nSo let's test this. \n\nPut 2 on: machine on. Then put 3 on: machine remains on. So the rule is OR (at least one). Therefore, 2 and 3 are blickets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is AND (all blickets must be present). But that doesn't fit because 2 alone activated it. \n\nWait, no. If the rule were AND, then all blickets must be on. But since adding 2 alone turned it on, that's impossible. So the rule is OR. \n\nSo the blickets are 2 and 3. The rule is the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present on it. \n\nBut to confirm, perhaps there's a different rule. For example, the machine activates if the total number of blickets is even, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine activates when exactly two objects are present, but that's not the case because adding 2 alone (step 4) turned it on. \n\nWait, in step 4: when objects 0,1,2 were on the machine, adding 2 turned the light on. Wait, wait, the initial steps were:\n\n- Put 0 on \u2192 no change.\n\n- Put 1 on \u2192 still off.\n\n- Put 2 on \u2192 light turns on. So at that point, three objects (0,1,2) were on the machine, but the light turned on when 2 was added. So the presence of 2 caused activation. \n\nThen, removing 0 and 1 left 2 on the machine, and the light stayed on. So 2 alone is sufficient. Similarly, 3 alone is sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the rule is that the machine turns on if any of the blickets (2 or 3) are present. \n\nSo the blickets are 2 and 3. The rule is that the machine activates when at least one blicket is on it. \n\nTo confirm, perhaps test putting 0 and 1 again. \n\nIf I put object 0 on the machine now, the light should stay off. Then put object 1 on, still off. Then put 2 on, light turns on. \n\nBut perhaps the user has limited steps. Since the user has already done 9 steps, maybe they want to exit now. But maybe confirm with one more test. \n\nFor example, put object 0 and 1 on the machine. \n\nCurrent state after last step: all objects are off. So:\n\n> put object 0 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\n> put object 1 on machine \u2192 light off.\n\nThen put object 2 \u2192 light on. \n\nBut since steps are limited, maybe proceed to exit since the current experiments already suggest that 2 and 3 are blickets, and the rule is OR."}

So the goal is to determine if object 1 is a blicket. From the game's description, a blicket is an object that has a non-zero mutual information with the machine's state. That means the presence of the blicket on the machine affects whether the machine turns on.\n\nLooking at the steps taken:\n\n1. When objects 0, 1, and 2 were placed on the machine, the light turned on. Then when each was removed one by one, the light stayed on until object 2 was removed. So when object 2 was taken off, the light turned off. That suggests that object 2 is a blicket because its removal caused the machine to turn off.\n\n2. Then object 3 was placed alone on the machine, and the light turned on. When removed, it turned off. So object 3 is also a blicket.\n\nNow, what about object 1? When objects 0, 1, and 2 were on the machine, the light was on. When objects 0 and 1 were taken off, leaving object 2, the light stayed on. But when object 2 was removed, it turned off. So even with objects 0 and 1 on the machine, removing them didn't affect the light. That implies that objects 0 and 1 aren't necessary for the machine to stay on. Therefore, they might not be blickets. \n\nThe key here is that the machine's state depends on at least one blicket being present. Since when objects 0 and 1 were removed, the machine stayed on as long as object 2 was there, their presence or absence didn't influence the machine's state. Hence, their mutual information with the machine's state is zero. Therefore, object 1 isn't a blicket."}

So, when the object is on the machine, does the machine's state (on/off) change in a way that depends on that object?\n\nLooking at the steps taken:\n\n- When objects 0,1,2 were placed on the machine, the light turned on after adding object 2. Then removing 0 and 1 didn't turn it off, but removing 2 did. So maybe object 2 is a blicket. The machine stayed on when only 0 and 1 were on, but that's after adding 2. Wait, no: when 0,1,2 were all on, the machine turned on after adding 2. Then when 0 was removed, machine stayed on. Then when 1 was removed, still on. Only when 2 was removed, it turned off. So that suggests that object 2 alone was causing the machine to be on. So 2 is a blicket.\n\nThen, when object 3 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on. Then removing it turned the light off. So putting 3 on the machine made it activate, and taking it off deactivated. That suggests that object 3 is a blicket as well, since its presence on the machine is directly causing the machine to turn on.\n\nBut wait, the initial setup: after putting 0,1,2 on the machine, the light turned on when 2 was added. But then when they took off 0 and 1, the machine stayed on until 2 was removed. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. So in that case, both 2 and 3 are blickets because each individually can activate the machine when placed on it. So when 3 was placed alone, machine turned on, which implies 3 is a blicket. Hence, the answer should be True."}
