Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let's analyze the observations:\n\n1. When object 0 is placed alone on the machine, the machine turns on.\n2. When object 1 is placed alone, the machine stays off.\n3. When object 2 is placed alone, the machine turns on.\n4. When object 3 is placed alone, the machine turns on.\n5. When object 3 is on the machine with object 1 (which alone doesn't activate the machine), the machine turns on.\n6. When object 3 is the only object on the machine (after removing others), the machine stays off (this contradicts earlier observations where placing object 3 alone turned it on).\n\nThere seems to be some inconsistency in the behavior with object 3. However, the most consistent interpretation is that object 3 can activate the machine when placed alone (observed twice), except for one case where it didn't (possibly due to a recording error or the machine having some additional rules we haven't discovered). The preponderance of evidence suggests object 3 can activate the machine.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
