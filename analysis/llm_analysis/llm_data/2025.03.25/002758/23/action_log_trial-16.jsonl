Initial tests with single objects:\n- Only object 0 and object 1 individually turned on the machine when placed alone\n- Objects 2 and 3 did not turn on the machine when placed alone\n\n2. Combined object tests:\n- Machine turned on when object 3 was added to object 1 (which wasn't activating the machine alone at that point)\n- Machine stayed on when removing object 2 while object 3 remained\n- Machine turned off when removing object 0 while objects 1 and 2 remained\n\n3. Key observations:\n- Object 0 seems to be a blicket (activates machine alone)\n- Object 1 sometimes activates alone, sometimes doesn't - suggests it's not a blicket\n- Object 3 seems to activate only in combination with others\n- Object 2 never seems to activate the machine\n\nThe rule appears to be: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. From the tests, object 0 is clearly a blicket. Object 3 also seems to be a blicket since it activated the machine in combination with object 1 (which isn't a blicket). Objects 1 and 2 don't seem to be blickets.\n\nTo confirm, I'll test object 3 alone again since earlier it only activated in combination.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
