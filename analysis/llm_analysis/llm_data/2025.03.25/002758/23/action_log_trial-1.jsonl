When object 0 was last remaining on machine, machine stayed ON until it was removed.\n6. Similar pattern with object 1 - machine stayed ON when it was last remaining.\n\nKey observations:\n- Machine turns ON when any object is placed on it (so all objects might be blickets)\n- Machine stays ON as long as at least one object remains on it\n- Machine turns OFF only when no objects are on it\n\nThis suggests the rule is: The machine turns ON when at least one object is placed on it, and turns OFF when no objects are on it. Therefore, all objects (0,1,2,3) are blickets because their presence affects the machine's state.\n\nTo confirm this, I should test if the machine can be ON with no objects (which we've seen it can't), and verify that any single object turns it ON (which we've seen).\n\nFinal test to confirm:\n> take all objects off the machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
