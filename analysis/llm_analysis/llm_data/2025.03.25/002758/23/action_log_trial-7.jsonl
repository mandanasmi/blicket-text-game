From initial observations, putting object 3 on the machine turns the light on, and removing it turns the light off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n2. When object 0 was added alongside object 3, the light remained on. However, we don't yet know if object 0 alone can turn the machine on or if it interacts with object 3.\n3. Next steps:\n   - Test object 0 alone to see if it can turn the machine on by itself.\n   - If it doesn't, then object 3 is likely the only blicket, and the rule is \"machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\"\n   - If it does, then both object 0 and 3 may be blickets, and the rule might involve multiple blickets.\n\n**Command:**\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
