Later, with only objects 3 and 4 on, the machine was on.\n4. When object 0 was added back (with 3 already on), the machine turned on again.\n5. Adding object 5 or 6 when the machine was already on kept it on.\n\nKey patterns:\n- The machine turns on when both object 0 and object 3 are present together.\n- Object 3 alone doesn't activate the machine (when tried alone after removing others).\n- Object 0 alone can activate the machine when object 3 is already present.\n\nThis suggests that both object 0 and object 3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on when at least two blickets are present.
