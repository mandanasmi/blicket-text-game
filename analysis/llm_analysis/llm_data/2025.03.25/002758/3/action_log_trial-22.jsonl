When objects 0, 1, 2 were on the machine, the light stayed off. Adding object 3 turned the light on (step 5). This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n2. However, when object 3 was the only object on the machine (after removing others), the light stayed off (steps 18-19). This suggests object 3 alone cannot activate the machine.\n3. The light turned on when object 1 was added to the machine (steps 8, 14, 21), and also when object 7 was added (steps 23-26), suggesting these are likely blickets.\n4.
