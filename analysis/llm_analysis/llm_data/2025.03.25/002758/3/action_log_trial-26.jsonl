The most consistent pattern is that object 2 is a blicket, as it reliably activates the machine when placed, and its removal often (but not always) deactivates it.

When object 2 and object 6 were on the machine together, the light turned on (steps 3 and 24).\n2. When object 7 was added to the machine (with other objects already on it), the light remained on (step 14).\n3. When object 2 was removed (with object 7 remaining), the light turned off (step 16).\n4. Object 7 alone or with non-blickets (like object 3,4,5) didn't turn the machine on.\n\nThis suggests object 7 is not sufficient to activate the machine by itself or with non-blickets, and its presence doesn't maintain activation when key blickets (like object 2) are removed. The activation seems to depend on objects 2 and 6.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
