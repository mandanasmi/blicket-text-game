The machine only turned on in two scenarios:\n   - When object 6 was placed alone on the machine (step 6)\n   - When objects 5 and 6 were together on the machine (step 25)\n\n2. Other combinations didn't activate the machine:\n   - Objects 0,1,2,3,4,7 individually or in combinations didn't activate the machine\n   - Object 5 alone didn't activate the machine (step 7)\n\n3. Object 7 was placed on the machine alone (step 18) and didn't activate it.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that object 6 is definitely a blicket (since it activated the machine alone), while object 5 might be a conditional blicket (only activates with 6). Object 7 never activated the machine in any combination we tested.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
