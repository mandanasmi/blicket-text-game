Removing 6 turned the light off, and putting it back turned it on again.\n5. Object 7 didn't turn the light off when added, but also didn't turn it on by itself.\n\nFrom this, it seems:\n- Object 6 is definitely a blicket (turns machine on by itself)\n- Objects 0-5 and 7 are not blickets (they didn't turn machine on alone or in combinations tried)\n- The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it\n\nSince we've found one blicket (object 6) and tested most other objects without finding additional blickets, I think we can conclude the solution.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
