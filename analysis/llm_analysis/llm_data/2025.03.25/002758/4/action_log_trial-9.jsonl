Initially, object 0 and object 7 were on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When only object 0 was on the machine, the light remained off.\n3. When only object 7 was on the machine (after taking others off), the light remained off.\n4. Various combinations of objects were tried (0+1, 0+2, 0+7, etc.), but the light never turned on.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that:\n- Neither object 0 nor object 7 alone activates the machine\n- No combination tried so far has activated the machine\n- We haven't found any evidence that object 7 is a blicket (since it never contributed to activating the machine in any tested scenario)\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
