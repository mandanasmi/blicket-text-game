Initially, putting objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine didn't turn it on.\n2. When object 3 was added (with 0,1,2 already on), the machine turned on.\n3. Removing object 0 turned it off again.\n4. Adding object 0 back (with 1,2,3 on) turned it on again.\n5. Adding object 4 (with 0,1,2,3 on) kept it on.\n6. Removing object 0 again turned it off.\n\nThis suggests that object 0 and object 3 together are crucial for activating the machine, while other objects don't seem to affect it. The rule might be that the machine turns on when both object 0 AND object 3 are on it (a conjunction rule).\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I should:\n1. Clear the machine\n2. Put just object 0 on - should stay off\n3. Put just object 3 on - should stay off\n4.
