Removing object 4 turned the light off, and putting it back turned it on again.\n3. When only object 7 was on the machine, the light was on.\n4. Other objects (0-3,5,6) didn't seem to affect the light when added individually or in groups.\n5. The light seems to require either object 4 OR object 7 to be present (possibly both, but we've seen it works with either one alone).\n\nFrom this, I can conclude:\n- Objects 4 and 7 are likely blickets\n- The rule appears to be: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it (OR rule)\n\nTo confirm this, I should test if both blickets together also turn on the machine (though we've seen each works individually).\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Subsequent tests showed that the machine turns on when either object 4 or object 7 is on it, regardless of other objects.\n5. Object 1 was never able to turn the machine on by itself or in combination with other non-blickets.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 1 is not a blicket, as it never contributed to turning the machine on.
