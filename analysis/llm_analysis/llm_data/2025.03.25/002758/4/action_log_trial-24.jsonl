Start by testing individual objects to see if any single object can turn the machine on. This will help identify if any object is a blicket by itself.\n2. If no single object turns the machine on, test pairs of objects to see if combinations trigger the machine.\n3. Continue testing larger combinations if needed, while keeping track of which objects are likely blickets based on the machine's behavior.\n4.
