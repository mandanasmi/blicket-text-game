The machine only turns on when object 7 is placed on it (either alone or with other objects).\n2.

No other single object (0-6) caused the machine to turn on when placed alone or in combination (except when object 7 was present).\n\nThis strongly suggests that object 7 is the only blicket in this scenario, as it is the sole object whose presence activates the machine.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
