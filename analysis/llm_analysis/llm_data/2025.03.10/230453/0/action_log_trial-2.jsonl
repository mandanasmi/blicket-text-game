However, the light does not turn on when object 0 is on the machine alone, nor when objects 2 or 3 are on the machine. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket, and object 0 is not a blicket on its own but may contribute to turning on the light when combined with object 1. Object 3, when placed on the machine, does not turn on the light, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 1255, "total_tokens": 1387}, "api_error": false}
