However, when both objects 2 and 3 were removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket, and object 3 may also be a blicket since it can turn on the machine independently. \n\nSince we have not tested object 3 alone without object 2, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket based solely on the current information. \n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1375}, "api_error": false}
