You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.\nAfter the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n\nReply concisely and exactly with the requested format.", "prompt": "You are in a room.
