You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- You should focus on hypothesis that specifies which object(s) are blickets, and how the blickets turn on the machine.\n- Any and all of the objects could be blickets. Only the object identities matter for whether or not the machine turns on.\n- At each step, you will be provided with observations up to the current step, including previous actions ('> action') and outcomes of the actions. \n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou may be prompted at each turn to either reason about the space of hypothesis, or to choose actions which will reduce this space of hypothesis.\n", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Only the object identities matter for whether or not the machine turns on.\n- At each step, you will be provided with observations up to the current step, including previous actions ('> action') and outcomes of the actions. \n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
