You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- At each step, you will be provided with observations up to the current step, including previous actions ('> action') and outcomes of the actions. \n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- The underlying rule could be one of: (i) all the blickets have to be on the machine for it to turn on, or (ii) any of the blickets can to be on the machine for it to turn on.\n- Do not consider rules such as \"as long as there are at least N objects on the machine it will turn on\", or \"an even / odd number of objects will make the machine turn on\". Focus on figuring out which objects are blickets and how they make the machine turn on.\n- You should think about how to efficiently take actions to figure out the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
