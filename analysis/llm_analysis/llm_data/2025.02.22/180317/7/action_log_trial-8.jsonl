Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, the light on the machine was consistently on when object 3 was placed on the machine, but it was also on when other objects were present. However, when object 3 was taken off the machine, the light remained on with other objects. This suggests that object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on, as it was not tested alone. Therefore, it is likely that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 1221, "total_tokens": 1321}}
