Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, object 3 was able to turn on the machine when placed on it, but it also did not turn on the machine when object 1 was present. Object 1 consistently turned the machine off when placed on it, indicating it is not a blicket. Since object 3 was able to turn the machine on in some scenarios, it suggests that it could be a blicket, but it is not conclusive without further testing. \n\nThus, I cannot definitively say that object 3 is a blicket based on the current information.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 1220, "total_tokens": 1392}}
