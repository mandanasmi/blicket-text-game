Let me start by understanding the current state.\n\nThe room has objects 0, 1, 2, 3 all on the floor. The machine is off. My first action was trying to put object 0 on the machine, but the response said \"0 is not a recognized object.\" Wait, maybe I need to use the exact command syntax. Then I tried \"put object 0 on machine\" and that worked, turning the machine's light on. So object 0 alone activates the machine. But maybe the machine activates when any single blicket is placed? Or maybe there's a more complex rule.\n\nBut wait, what if the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it? Since putting object 0 on made it work, perhaps object 0 is a blicket. But I need to test other objects to confirm. Let's try adding another object. Maybe if I add another object, the machine stays on or turns off. Wait, but the machine is already on. I need to see if combinations affect it. For example, if object 0 is a blicket, then adding another blicket might not change the state, but adding a non-blicket also might not. Alternatively, maybe the rule requires a specific number or combination.\n\nNext steps: Test other objects one by one. Let's take object 0 off and try another. Wait, but the machine is on with object 0. Let's try putting object 1 on the machine. If the machine stays on, maybe object 1 is also a blicket. If it turns off, maybe the rule is different. Wait, but the machine's state might depend on the combination. Wait, actually, when I put object 0 on, the machine turned on. Let's see what happens when I add object 1. Maybe the machine remains on, which would suggest that multiple blickets are allowed. Alternatively, if the machine requires exactly one blicket, adding another might not affect it. But first, let's test each object individually.\n\nSo, take object 0 off the machine first. Then put object 1 on. If the machine turns on, then object 1 is a blicket. If not, then it's not. Then repeat for 2 and 3. But maybe the rule is more complex, like requiring two blickets. But since object 0 alone worked, maybe it's a single blicket. But need to verify.\n\nWait, after putting object 0 on the machine, the light is on. If I put another object, say 1, on the machine, does the light stay on or go off? If it stays on, maybe either object 0 or 1 is a blicket. But if the machine turns off, that would suggest a different rule, like needing exactly one. But that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe the machine is on if any blicket is present, regardless of others. So adding a non-blicket wouldn't affect it. But how to know which is which.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step. First, take object 0 off. Then put object 1 on. If the machine turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then 1 isn't. Then same for others.\n\nWait, but the machine is currently on with object 0. So taking object 0 off would remove the activation. Then putting object 1 on would test if 1 is a blicket. Let's try that.\n\nSo next command: take object 0 off the machine. Then put object 1 on. But let's do that step by step. However, each step counts, and I have 32 steps. Let me plan efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires all blickets to be present. But that's unlikely because putting object 0 alone turned it on. So perhaps any single blicket activates it. But need to check each object.\n\nBut maybe some objects are blickets and others aren't. So let's test each one individually.\n\nFirst, remove object 0. Then put object 1 on. If the machine turns on, 1 is a blicket. If not, then not. Then same for 2 and 3.\n\nSo the next step would be to take object 0 off. Let's do that.\n\nBut after that, the machine's light would turn off, since the only object on it (0) was removed. Then putting 1 on would test if 1 is a blicket.\n\nSo commands:\n\nTake object 0 off the machine. Then put object 1 on.\n\nBut let's do that in steps. Let me think in terms of the commands.\n\nCurrent state: machine has object 0, light is on.\n\nFirst command: take object 0 off the machine. Then machine is empty, light off. Then put object 1 on. If light turns on, 1 is a blicket. If not, it's not.\n\nSo let's proceed with that."}

Let me start by recalling what's happened so far.\n\nInitially, all objects (0, 1, 2, 3) are on the floor. When I tried putting 0 on the machine, the first time I got an error saying \"0 is not a recognized object.\" Maybe I didn't format the command correctly. Then when I used \"put object 0 on machine,\" it worked, and the machine's light turned on. Then taking object 0 off turned it off again. So object 0 alone can activate the machine. That suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, right? Because when it's on the machine, the light comes on.\n\nBut wait, maybe the rule isn't just having any single blicket. Maybe it's more complex. For example, maybe the machine requires at least one blicket, but maybe there are cases where multiple blickets are needed, or certain combinations. But in this first test, object 0 alone worked. Let me test other objects one by one to see if they also activate the machine. If another object also activates the machine alone, then the rule could be that any blicket present will turn it on, but there might be multiple blickets. Alternatively, if only object 0 works alone, then maybe the rule is that exactly object 0 is a blicket, and the machine activates when it's present.\n\nSo next, I should test object 1. Let me try putting object 1 on the machine. If the light turns on, then object 1 is also a blicket. If not, then maybe only object 0 is. But wait, when I put object 0 on, the light was on. Taking it off turned it off. So if object 1 is a blicket, putting it on should turn the light on. Let me try that.\n\nWait, but maybe the rule isn't additive. Maybe the machine requires a certain number of blickets. For example, maybe two or more blickets need to be on the machine. But since object 0 alone worked, that suggests that the rule is that at least one blicket is present. Unless that initial test was a fluke. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should test each object individually first. So let's try putting each one on the machine one by one and see if the light turns on. That's a systematic approach. Let's start with object 0 already done. Then object 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo next step: put object 1 on the machine. Let's see what happens. If the light turns on, then 1 is a blicket. If not, then it's not. Then repeat for 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the sum of blicktness is above a threshold, but in this case, putting object 0 alone worked, so that suggests each blicket has a value, and maybe the sum needs to be >=1. But if 0's value is 1, then adding another would make 2, but the machine only needs 1. So maybe each blicket contributes 1, and the machine activates if the total is at least 1. But then, any blicket would activate it alone.\n\nBut in the initial test, object 0 worked. Let's check others.\n\nSo next command: put object 1 on machine. Let's see what happens."}

The goal is to determine which objects are blickets and the rule that makes the machine turn on. From the previous interactions:\n\n- Putting object 0 on the machine turned the light on. Then taking it off turned it off. So object 0 alone activates the machine.\n- Then putting object 1 on the machine didn't turn it on. So object 1 alone doesn't activate it.\n- Then adding object 2 on the machine (with object 1 still there?) made the light turn on. Wait, but when you put object 1 on the machine, the light was off. Then putting object 2 on made it turn on. So maybe the combination of objects 1 and 2 together activates the machine? But that might not be the case. Let me check the exact commands again.\n\nWait, the commands were:\n\n1. put object 0 on machine \u2192 light on.\n2. take object 0 off \u2192 light off.\n3. put object 1 on machine \u2192 light stays off.\n4. put object 2 on machine \u2192 light turns on.\n\nSo after step 3, only object 1 is on the machine, and the light is off. Then adding object 2 (so objects 1 and 2 are both on the machine) turns the light on. That suggests that the combination of 1 and 2 activates the machine. But then why did object 0 alone work?\n\nSo maybe the rule is that the machine activates if there's at least one blicket, but some objects might require others to be present. Alternatively, maybe the rule is based on the number of blickets. For example, if there's an even number, or a certain threshold. But let's test more.\n\nWait, in the first test, object 0 alone worked. Then object 1 alone didn't. Then adding object 2 to object 1 made it work. So possible scenarios:\n\n- Object 0 is a blicket, object 1 is not, object 2 is a blicket. Then the machine activates when at least one blicket is present. But when object 1 is alone, it's not a blicket, so no. Then adding object 2 (a blicket) activates it. That fits. But why when object 0 was put on, it worked. So 0 and 2 are blickets. Then 1 and 3 are not. But need to check other combinations.\n\nBut maybe the rule is more complex. For example, the machine activates if the sum of blicktness is odd, or something. Or maybe the presence of certain combinations. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine activates when exactly one blicket is present. But that can't be because when objects 1 and 2 were on, the machine turned on. If 0 is a blicket, then when it's alone, it's one, which works. Then if 1 isn't a blicket, and 2 is, then putting 2 on with 1 (non-blicket) would be one blicket (object 2), which would activate the machine. But in that case, the rule would be \"exactly one blicket\". But then if we put two blickets on, it would not activate. But we need to test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine activates if there's an odd number of blickets. Let's see:\n\nIf 0 is a blicket (count 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 on). Then 1 is not (count 0 \u2192 even \u2192 off). Then 1 and 2: if 2 is a blicket, then count 2 (even) \u2192 off. But in the actual case, when 1 and 2 were on, the machine turned on. So that contradicts. So that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is \"at least one blicket\". But when object 1 was on the machine (assuming it's not a blicket), adding object 2 (a blicket) would make it on. That fits. Then 0 and 2 are blickets. But why does putting 2 alone not tested yet. Wait, the user hasn't tried putting 2 alone yet. Let me check the previous steps.\n\nWait, the steps so far:\n\n- After putting object 2 on the machine (when object 1 was already there), the light turned on. But when object 1 was alone, it was off. So either:\n\nCase 1: Object 2 is a blicket. So when added to object 1 (non-blicket), the machine has one blicket \u2192 on. Then, when only object 2 is on the machine, it would also be on. But we haven't tested that yet.\n\nCase 2: The combination of objects 1 and 2 is required. Maybe both need to be present. But that would mean that 1 and 2 are blickets only when together. But that complicates the rule. However, the problem states that blickets have \"blicktness inside them\", implying that the property is intrinsic. So the rule is likely based on their individual properties.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the rule is that the machine activates if the number of blickets is a multiple of some number. For example, if two or more blickets are present. But then when object 0 was alone (a blicket), the machine turned on. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. So far, the known data points are:\n\n- Object 0 alone \u2192 on. So 0 is a blicket.\n- Object 1 alone \u2192 off. So 1 is not a blicket.\n- Object 1 and 2 together \u2192 on. So either 2 is a blicket (since adding it to non-blicket 1 gives one blicket \u2192 on), or perhaps 1 and 2 together form a blicket (but that's unlikely as per the problem statement).\n\nSo if 2 is a blicket, then adding it to 1 (non-blicket) would result in one blicket \u2192 machine on. That fits. Then, when we take object 1 off, leaving 2 alone, the machine should stay on. But we haven't tested that yet.\n\nWait, but the user's next step after putting 2 on the machine (with 1 already there) is to take some action. Let's see what the current state is: objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, and the light is on. Now, if the user takes object 1 off, leaving 2 alone, does the light stay on? If so, then 2 is a blicket. If not, maybe the rule requires both 1 and 2.\n\nSo possible next steps: take object 1 off, check if the light stays on. If yes, then 2 is a blicket. If no, then the combination is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine's rule is that the total number of blickets must be exactly one. But then 0 is a blicket, 1 is not, 2 is a blicket. So when 2 is added to 1 (non), the total is one, which works. Then, if you put 0 and 2 together (two blickets), the machine would turn off. But that's a possible rule.\n\nBut the user hasn't tested putting 2 alone yet. Let's think of the next command. The current state is objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, light is on. The user could take object 1 off to see if the light stays on (indicating 2 is a blicket) or turns off (indicating that the presence of 1 and 2 together is required). \n\nAlternatively, the user could test object 3. Let's see.\n\nBut first, perhaps test whether 2 alone activates the machine. So take object 1 off the machine, leaving 2. If the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the combination of 1 and 2 is needed.\n\nSo the next command should be 'take object 1 off machine'. Let's see what happens.\n\nAfter that, if the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the activation requires both 1 and 2. But according to previous steps, putting 1 alone didn't activate, and adding 2 did. So if removing 1 now makes the light turn off, then the rule might be that both 1 and 2 are needed. But that would imply that neither is a blicket individually, but together they activate. But the problem says that blickets have blicktness inside, so the rule is likely additive. So perhaps each blicket contributes to the activation. For example, if the machine requires at least one blicket. Then, in the case of 1 and 2, if 2 is a blicket, then the machine would be on. So taking 1 off would leave 2, and the light would stay on. So the user should test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that exactly two objects are needed, but that's less likely. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe user's next action should be to take object 1 off the machine to see if the light stays on. Let's simulate:\n\nAfter 'take object 1 off machine', the machine now has object 2. If the light stays on, then 2 is a blicket. If it turns off, then the combination of 1 and 2 (regardless of their individual status) is required. So this is a critical test.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine's rule is that the sum of the object numbers (mod 4 or something) is zero. But that seems arbitrary. Let's stick to testing individual objects.\n\nSo the next command should be taking object 1 off. Let's input that."}

Object 3: when added to 2, stays on. But when I put 3 on with 2, maybe 3 isn't a blicket, but since 2 is already there, adding 3 doesn't change it. But when I put 1 on, it didn't activate. Then adding 2 made it activate. Then removing 1 (so only 2) kept it on. So 2 is a blicket, 1 is not. Then adding 3 to 2, light stays on. So 3's effect is unclear. Maybe 3 is a blicket, but maybe not. Need to test 3 alone.\n\nWait, when I put 3 on the machine with 2 already on, the light was on. But what if I test 3 alone? Let me try that. So I need to take off all objects except 3 and see if the light turns on.\n\nBut right now, the machine has objects 2 and 3. The light is on. If I take 2 off, leaving 3, does the light stay on? Let's do that. So the next step should be to take object 2 off the machine. If the light stays on, then 3 is a blicket. If it turns off, then 3 isn't. So that's the next logical step."}

I need to figure out which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on. Let me recap what's happened so far.\n\nFirst, when I put object 0 on the machine, the light turned on. Taking it off turned the light off. Then object 1 was placed on the machine, but the light stayed off. Adding object 2 made the light come on. Then taking object 1 off kept the light on. Then adding object 3 kept the light on. But when object 2 was removed, the light turned off. \n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The machine turns on when certain combinations are present. Let's see the individual effects. Object 0 alone activates the machine. Object 1 alone doesn't. Object 2 alone does (since when I put 1 and 2 on, the light was on. Then removing 1 left 2, and light stayed on). Wait, no. Wait, when I put 1 on, light was off. Then adding 2 made it on. So 1+2: on. Removing 1 (leaving 2) kept it on. So object 2 alone works. Then adding 3 kept it on. So 2+3: on. Then removing 2 (leaving 3) turned it off. So object 3 alone doesn't work. \n\nWait, let's list the combinations:\n\n- Object 0 alone: on. So 0 is a blicket.\n- Object 1 alone: off. Not a blicket.\n- Object 2 alone: yes, because when 2 was on the machine (after removing 1), light stayed on. So 2 is a blicket.\n- Object 3 alone: when 2 and 3 were on, removing 2 left 3, and the light went off. So 3 alone doesn't work. \n\nBut then, when I put 3 on the machine along with 2, the light stayed on. So maybe 3 isn't a blicket, but adding it didn't affect because 2 was already there. Then when 3 was on with others, maybe the rule is that at least one blicket is present. Wait, but when 0 was on alone, it worked. When 2 was on alone, worked. When 2 and 3 were on, worked. Then when 2 was removed (only 3 left), it turned off. So 3 is not a blicket. \n\nSo far, 0 and 2 are blickets. Now, what about object 3? Let's test if object 3 alone works. The user hasn't tested that yet. Wait, when the user put object 3 on the machine, they were already on the machine with 2, but after removing 2, the light went off. Wait, the steps were: put 3 on machine (so machine had 2 and 3) \u2192 light on. Then take 2 off \u2192 machine now has only 3 \u2192 light off. So 3 alone doesn't work. So 3 is not a blicket.\n\nWhat about combinations? Like 0 and 3. Let's see. If I put 0 and 3 on the machine, does it stay on? But that hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, 0 and 1. Let's see. When 1 was placed first, the light was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. So 1 isn't a blicket. \n\nSo possible blickets are 0 and 2. But maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if exactly one blicket is present. Because when 0 is on alone, it works. When 2 is on alone, it works. But when 2 and 3 are on, it's still on. Wait, but 3 isn't a blicket. So the machine is on if at least one blicket is present. So if there's a blicket on the machine, regardless of other objects, it's on. Then, when 2 and 3 are on, since 2 is a blicket, it's on. Removing 2 leaves 3, so off. \n\nBut what about when putting 0 and 1 on the machine? Let's see. If 0 is a blicket, adding 1 (non-blicket) should keep the machine on. But that hasn't been tested yet. The user hasn't tried putting multiple objects together except for 1+2, 2+3. \n\nWait, the user did put object 1 on the machine first, and the light was off. Then added 2, and light came on. So 1 alone: off. 1+2: on. Then removing 1 (leaving 2): on. So 2 alone works. So 2 is a blicket. \n\nSimilarly, 0 alone works. So 0 is a blicket. \n\nBut what about combining 0 and 1? Let's say 0 is on, and then add 1. The machine would stay on because 0 is present. But if the rule is that the machine requires exactly one blicket, then adding 0 (blicket) and 1 (non) would still work. If the rule is \"at least one\", then yes. But maybe it's a different rule, like \"all objects on the machine must be blickets\". But in that case, when 2 and 3 are on, machine would be off because 3 isn't a blicket. But when 2 and 3 were on, the light was on. So that contradicts that rule. So the rule must be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present. So any number of blickets (\u22651) will turn it on. \n\nSo the blickets are 0 and 2. Now, to confirm, maybe try putting 0 and 1 on the machine. If the light stays on, that supports the rule. But the user hasn't done that yet. So maybe in the next step, try that. \n\nBut given the step limit, perhaps I should check. Let's see. The user has 32 steps, but they've used 9 steps so far. Let me see what's left. \n\nWait, the user's steps so far:\n\n1. put 0 on machine \u2192 light on\n2. take 0 off \u2192 light off\n3. put 1 on \u2192 light off\n4. put 2 on \u2192 light on (so 1 and 2 on machine, light on)\n5. take 1 off \u2192 light on (only 2 left)\n6. put 3 on \u2192 light on (2 and 3)\n7. take 2 off \u2192 light off (only 3 left)\n\nSo the possible blickets are 0 and 2. \n\nBut maybe there's another possibility. Let's think: when 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. Then taking 1 off leaves 2, which keeps the light on. So 2 is a blicket. \n\nWhen 2 and 3 are on, light is on. Taking 2 off leaves 3, which turns it off. So 3 isn't a blicket. \n\nObject 0 alone works. So 0 is a blicket. \n\nBut what about the rule? If the rule is that the machine turns on if there's at least one blicket, then that fits. \n\nBut perhaps the rule is more complex. For example, the machine turns on if the number of blickets is even, or something else. Let's check the existing data:\n\n- 0 on: on (1 blicket \u2192 on)\n- 1 on: off\n- 2 on: on\n- 3 on: off\n- 1 and 2: on (2 is blicket)\n- 2 and 3: on (2 is blicket)\n- 0 and 1: not tested yet. If 0 is a blicket and 1 is not, the machine should be on. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires exactly one blicket. But in the case where 2 and 3 are on (2 is a blicket, 3 not), the machine is on. That would contradict the \"exactly one\" rule. So the rule must be \"at least one\".\n\nSo the blickets are 0 and 2. The rule is that the machine activates if at least one blicket is on it. \n\nBut to confirm, maybe the user should test putting 0 and 1 on the machine. If the light is on, that supports the rule. If the user does that:\n\nPut 0 on \u2192 light on. Then add 1 \u2192 light should stay on. Then remove 0 \u2192 light off (since only 1 is left). \n\nBut given the current step count, maybe the user can exit now if they're confident. However, to be thorough, perhaps test that combination. \n\nIn the current state, after step 7, the machine has 3 on it, but the light is off. So the next step could be to put 0 and 1 on, but the user needs to do that step by step. Let me see. \n\nThe user's last action was taking object 2 off the machine, leaving object 3 on. The light is off. So currently, the machine has object 3. \n\nSo, next step: take 3 off the machine. Then put 0 on. Then put 1 on. \n\nBut given the step limit, maybe it's better to exit now. But perhaps the user should test combining 0 and 1. \n\nAlternatively, the user can already conclude that 0 and 2 are blickets, and the rule is \"at least one\". \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. For example, when 0 and 2 are both on the machine, does the light stay on? Let's check. \n\nBut the user hasn't tried putting 0 and 2 together yet. Let's see. If the user puts 0 on the machine (light on), then adds 2 (light remains on). Then remove 0 (leaves 2, light stays on). That would confirm that both are blickets. \n\nBut in the current state, after step 7, the machine has object 3 on it, light off. So the next step would be to take 3 off. \n\nLet me outline possible next steps:\n\n1. Take 3 off machine (current state: machine empty, light off)\n2. Put 0 on \u2192 light on (confirming 0 is a blicket)\n3. Then put 1 on \u2192 light remains on (since 0 is present)\n4. Then take 0 off \u2192 light turns off (since only 1 remains)\n5. Then put 2 on \u2192 light on (since 2 is a blicket)\n6. Combine 0 and 2 \u2192 light remains on. \n\nBut the user has already established that 0 and 2 alone work. Combining them doesn't change the outcome, which supports the \"at least one\" rule. \n\nSo given the steps already taken, the user can probably conclude that the blickets are 0 and 2, and the rule is the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present. \n\nTherefore, the next step might be to exit, but the user may want to test one more combination to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine requires all objects on it to be blickets. Let's test that. For example, if putting 0 and 1 on the machine, the light would turn off because 1 is not a blicket. But according to the previous data, when 2 and 3 are on, the light is on. But 3 is not a blicket. So that contradicts the \"all\" rule. Therefore, the rule is not \"all must be blickets\". \n\nTherefore, the user can be confident that the rule is \"at least one blicket\", and the blickets are 0 and 2. \n\nSo the next command is to exit."}

Putting object 0 on the machine turned the light on. Then taking it off turned the light off. So object 0 might be a blicket because its presence activated the machine.\n\n2. Object 1 was put on the machine next, but the light stayed off. That suggests that object 1 alone doesn't activate the machine. But maybe it's a blicket that works in combination with others?\n\n3. Then object 2 was added to the machine (along with object 1), and the light turned on. But when object 1 was removed, the light stayed on. Wait, after putting object 2 on (with object 1 already there), the light turned on. Then taking object 1 off, leaving just object 2, the light remained on. That implies that object 2 alone is sufficient to keep the machine on. So object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. Then object 3 was added to the machine (now objects 2 and 3 are on it), and the light stayed on. But when object 2 was removed (leaving object 3), the light turned off. So object 3 alone doesn't activate the machine. Wait, but when object 3 was added with object 2, the light stayed on. But after removing object 2, the light went off. So object 3 might not be a blicket, but object 2 is. \n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n- When object 1 was on the machine alone, light was off. So object 1 isn't a blicket on its own. \n\n- Then putting object 2 on (machine has 1 and 2) turns the light on. But when 1 is removed, leaving 2, the light stays on. So object 2 alone is a blicket. So the activation here was because of object 2, not 1. So object 1's presence or absence doesn't affect it once 2 is there. \n\n- Then object 3 was added (so objects 2 and 3 are on machine) \u2192 light stays on. Then remove 2 \u2192 light off. So object 3 alone doesn't activate. \n\nSo from this, the blickets are objects 0, 2, and maybe 3? Wait, when object 3 was added to object 2, the light stayed on. But removing 2 caused it to turn off. So 3 alone doesn't work, but 2 works alone. \n\nWait, the initial step with object 0: putting it on made the light on. Then taking it off turned it off. So 0 is a blicket. Then putting 1 alone: light off. So 1 isn't. Putting 2 on (with 1 already there) turned it on. Then removing 1 (leaving 2) kept it on. So 2 is a blicket. Then adding 3 (with 2) kept it on, but removing 2 (leaving 3) turned it off. So 3 isn't a blicket. \n\nSo the blickets are 0 and 2. What about object 3? When it was put on the machine with 2, the light was on. But that's because 2 was already there. Then adding 3 didn't change the state. Then removing 2 made it turn off. So 3 isn't a blicket. \n\nNow, the key question is: is object 1 a blicket? From the steps, when 1 was alone on the machine, the light was off. So it's not a blicket by itself. But maybe the rule requires more than one blicket? Wait, but when object 0 was alone, the light turned on. So the rule might be that having at least one blicket activates the machine. \n\nTherefore, object 0 and 2 are blickets. Object 1 and 3 are not. So the answer should be False for object 1."}
