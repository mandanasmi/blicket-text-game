You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When object 0 and object 1 were on the machine together, the light turned on. Then removing object 0 turned it off, suggesting object 1 alone is not sufficient.\n2. Later, putting object 0 and object 3 on the machine turned it on, and removing object 0 turned it off, suggesting object 3 alone is not sufficient.\n3. When object 0 was on the machine with object 1 or object 3, the light turned on, but neither object 1 nor object 3 alone could turn it on.\n4. Object 2 never caused the machine to turn on in any combination tested.\n\nFrom this, it appears that object 0 is a blicket (since it's involved in all successful activations), and the rule likely requires at least one blicket to be present. Object 3 cannot activate the machine alone, but it also doesn't prevent activation when a blicket (object 0) is present. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room.
