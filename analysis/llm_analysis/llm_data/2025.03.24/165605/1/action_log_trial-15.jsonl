You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Putting object 0 alone didn't turn on the machine.\n2. Putting object 1 alone turned on the machine (so object 1 is a blicket).\n3.

Later, putting object 0 and object 1 together turned on the machine (but we know object 1 alone can do this).\n5. Putting object 3 on the machine with other objects didn't provide clear evidence it's a blicket, since the machine was already on when it was added.\n6. When only objects 1, 2, and 3 were on the machine, it stayed off (but we know object 1 alone can turn it on, so this suggests objects 2 and 3 are not blickets).\n7. The machine only turned on when object 0 or object 1 was present (but we saw object 1 alone can turn it on, while object 0 alone cannot).\n\nThe key evidence is that the machine never turned on when only object 3 was present or when object 3 was the last object added to a non-working configuration. The machine only turned on when object 1 was present or when object 0 was added to existing configurations (but since object 1 was already present in those cases, it's unclear if object 0 contributes).\n\nGiven that object 1 alone can turn on the machine and object 3 never demonstrated independent ability to turn on the machine, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
