Initial tests:\n- Putting objects 0,1,2 individually didn't turn on the machine\n- Only when object 3 was added did the machine turn on\n- Removing objects 0,1 didn't turn it off, but removing 2 did\n- Later tests show object 2 alone doesn't turn it on, but object 3 does\n\n2. Key findings:\n- Object 3 seems to be a blicket (turns machine on by itself)\n- Object 2 might be a conditional blicket (only works with others)\n- Objects 0 and 1 seem non-blickets (never caused activation)\n\n3. Hypothesis:\n- The rule might be \"machine turns on if at least one blicket is present\"\n- Or it could be more complex like \"machine turns on if blickets make up majority\"\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 3 alone again and check if object 2 works with other combinations.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
