You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When we had multiple objects on machine and removed some, light stayed on unless we removed object 5 (which seemed to be the last one keeping it on)\n5. Specifically, when objects 3,4,5,6,7 were on machine:\n   - Removing 3 and 4 kept light on\n   - Removing 5 turned light off\n   - Removing 6 kept light on\n   - Removing 7 kept light on\n\nKey observations:\n- The light is on when any blicket is on the machine\n- Object 5 seems to be a blicket (its removal alone turned light off)\n- Object 7's removal didn't affect the light when other objects were present\n- The light stayed on when object 7 was removed (with other objects present)\n\nConclusion: Object 7 is not a blicket because its presence or absence didn't affect the machine's state when other objects were present.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
