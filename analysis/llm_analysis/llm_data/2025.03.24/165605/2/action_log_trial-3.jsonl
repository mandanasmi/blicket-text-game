You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let's analyze the observations:\n\n1. Initially, object 3 was on the machine alone, and the machine was off.\n2. Objects 0, 1, and 2 were placed on the machine one by one - machine only turned on when object 2 was added (with 0 and 1 already on).\n3. Object 2 alone turns on the machine (tested by removing and re-adding it).\n4. Object 7 alone turns on the machine (tested by removing and re-adding it).\n5. Object 3 doesn't turn on the machine alone (initial state) or when added with other non-blickets (objects 4,5,6).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 7 is a blicket because it alone can activate the machine, similar to object 2. The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
