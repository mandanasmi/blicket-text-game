You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Initial tests showed that placing any single object (0-6) turns the machine on, except object 7 which didn't turn it on when placed alone.\n2. However, when object 3 was removed from a group of objects, the machine turned off, suggesting object 3 might be special.\n3. Further tests showed that:\n   - Object 3 alone can turn the machine on\n   - Object 7 alone cannot turn the machine on\n   - Object 0 alone can turn the machine on, but when removed while object 3 is present, the machine stays on\n4. This suggests object 3 is likely a blicket, and possibly the only one, since other objects seem to turn the machine on only when placed together (possibly because they're not blickets but the machine turns on when any object is placed unless there's a blicket present).\n\nHowever, this contradicts the initial observation where placing any single object (except 7) turned the machine on. The more consistent pattern seems to be that the machine turns on when any object is placed on it, except object 7. This would suggest object 7 is the only non-blicket, but then why did removing object 3 turn the machine off in one case?\n\nAlternative hypothesis: Maybe the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present, and object 3 is the only blicket. But then why did other objects turn it on when placed alone?\n\nNeed to test this further by checking if the machine stays on when object 3 is present with others.\n\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
