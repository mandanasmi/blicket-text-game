Removing object 4 - light turned off (confirms object 4 is blicket)\n11. Adding object 1 again - light turned on (consistent)\n\nFrom this, it seems:\n- Objects 1 and 4 are definitely blickets\n- The rule appears to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it\n- Objects 0, 2, 3, 6 are likely not blickets (since they didn't turn on the machine alone)\n- Objects 5 and 7 need more testing\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 5 alone on the machine.\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
