You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Initial observations:\n   - Objects 4 and 5 were initially on the machine, but the light was off. This suggests neither is a blicket alone or their combination doesn't activate the machine.\n   - When objects 0, 1, and 2 were added one by one, the machine only turned on after adding object 2, suggesting object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n2. Key interactions:\n   - With objects 2 and 3 on the machine, the light was on. Removing object 2 turned it off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 to object 2 turned the machine on, suggesting object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 6 and 7 were added when the machine was already on (with other objects), so we can't determine their status from those observations alone.\n   - When only object 1 was on the machine, the light was on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was added when other blickets (like object 1) were already on the machine, so we never saw it activate the machine alone or be necessary for activation.\n\n3. Conclusion:\n   - Since we never saw object 7 activate the machine by itself or be necessary for activation (the machine stayed on when it was removed), it's likely not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
