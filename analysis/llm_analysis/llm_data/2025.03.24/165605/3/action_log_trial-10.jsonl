The machine turned on with objects 3+2 but not with just 2, suggesting object 3 is special.\n5. Later tests show combinations where removing certain objects doesn't turn it off while others do.\n\nFrom this, I suspect:\n- The rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present on it.\n- Some objects may appear to activate the machine alone initially, but actually require another blicket to be present (like object 3 seems to be a true blicket, while others may not be).\n\nTo confirm, I should test object 3 alone after clearing the machine.\n\n> take object 0 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
