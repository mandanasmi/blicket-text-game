When object 3 was placed on the machine alone (after removing all other objects), the machine remained off. This suggests object 3 alone cannot activate the machine.\n2. The machine only turned on when object 2 was present (either alone or with other objects). This suggests object 2 is likely the blicket.\n3. Object 3's presence or absence didn't seem to affect the machine's state when object 2 was present.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 3 is not a blicket, as it doesn't contribute to activating the machine.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
