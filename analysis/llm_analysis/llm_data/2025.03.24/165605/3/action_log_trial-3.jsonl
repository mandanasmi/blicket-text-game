Initially, only object 1 was on the machine and the light was off.\n2. When object 0 was added (with object 1 already on), the light turned on.\n3. When object 1 was removed (leaving only object 0), the light stayed on.\n4. When object 3 was added alone (after all objects were removed), the light turned on.\n5. The light only turns off when no objects are on the machine, or when certain combinations are present (like just object 1 or just object 2).\n\nKey findings:\n- Object 0 alone turns on the machine\n- Object 3 alone turns on the machine\n- Object 1 alone does not turn on the machine\n- Object 2 alone does not turn on the machine\n\nTherefore, object 3 is a blicket because it can turn on the machine by itself.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
