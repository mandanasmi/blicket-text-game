You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Putting object 0 alone: light turned ON \u2192 suggests object 0 is a blicket\n4. Objects 1 and 3 individually didn't turn on the machine\n5. When object 2 was put back: light turned ON again\n6. Adding object 0 to object 2 kept light ON\n7. Multiple attempts to combine non-blickets (1 and 3) didn't turn on machine\n\nFrom this, it appears:\n- Blickets are objects that can individually turn on the machine (objects 0 and 2)\n- The rule seems to be \"OR\" - the machine turns on if ANY blicket is placed on it\n- Objects 1 and 3 are not blickets\n\nTo confirm, I should test putting object 0 and 2 together to see if light stays on (which it did), and verify that no combination of non-blickets turns it on.\n\nFinal conclusion:\n- Blickets: object 0 and object 2\n- Rule: The machine turns on when at least one blicket is placed on it (OR rule)\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
