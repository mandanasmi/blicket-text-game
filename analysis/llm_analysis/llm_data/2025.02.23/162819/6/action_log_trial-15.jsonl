However, when it was taken off the machine, the light turned off, indicating that it is not a blicket by itself. The other objects (0, 1, and 2) also turned the light on when placed on the machine, but their interactions suggest that they might be blickets. Since object 3 does not independently activate the machine, it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 95, "prompt_tokens": 1224, "total_tokens": 1319}}
