Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Object 7 was on the machine and the light was on, but when it was taken off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 7 could be a blicket. However, when object 6 was also tested, it consistently turned the light on by itself. Since object 6 alone can activate the machine, it is unclear if object 7 is necessary for the light to turn on. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket based solely on the information gathered.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 1415, "total_tokens": 1520}}
