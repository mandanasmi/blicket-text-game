However, it was also observed that the light remained on when object 3 was taken off, suggesting that there may be other objects contributing to the light being on. Since object 2 consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine, it is more definitive that object 2 is a blicket. \n\nGiven that object 3 did not turn the light on by itself when it was the only object on the machine, it cannot be confirmed as a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 85, "prompt_tokens": 1222, "total_tokens": 1307}}
