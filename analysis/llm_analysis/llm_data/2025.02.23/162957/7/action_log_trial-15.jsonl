Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, the light on the machine was consistently on when object 3 was placed on the machine, and it was also on when other objects were placed. However, when object 1 was placed on the machine, the light was off, indicating that object 1 is not a blicket. Since the light was on with object 3 present, it suggests that object 3 could be a blicket. However, without further testing to isolate object 3, we cannot definitively conclude its status.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 88, "prompt_tokens": 1225, "total_tokens": 1313}}
