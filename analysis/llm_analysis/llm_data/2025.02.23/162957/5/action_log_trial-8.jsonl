Object 3's behavior was inconsistent, turning the light on and off depending on the presence of other objects. Since object 7 was on the machine and the light was on, it suggests that object 7 is likely a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": false, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1480}}
