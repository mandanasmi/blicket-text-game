This suggests that object 0 might not be a blicket on its own, but it could be part of a combination that turns the machine on. Object 1 also seems to be involved in turning the machine on when combined with object 5. \n\nTo further investigate, I should test combinations of objects to see if there is a specific rule involving multiple objects.
