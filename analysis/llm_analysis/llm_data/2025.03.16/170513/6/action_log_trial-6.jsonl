Initially, the machine was on with objects 0, 1, 3, and 4 on it.\n2. Removing object 1 turned the machine off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n3. When object 3 was put back on the machine, it turned on, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n4. Object 7 was put on the machine when it was already on (with objects 1 and 3), and the machine remained on. However, when object 7 was removed, the machine stayed on, indicating object 7 did not affect the machine's state.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that object 7 is not a blicket because its presence or absence did not change the machine's state.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
