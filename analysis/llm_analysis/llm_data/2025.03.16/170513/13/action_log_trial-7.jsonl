Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, let's analyze the interactions:\n\n1. When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket.\n2. When object 3 is removed, the light turns off if no other objects are on the machine, indicating that object 3 alone can activate the machine.\n3. The light remains on when object 3 is on the machine, even if other objects are added or removed, as long as object 3 is present.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when it is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.
