When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n2. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n3. When object 3 was placed on the machine alone, the light did not turn on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n4. When object 1 was placed on the machine alone, the light did not turn on. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n5. When object 0 and object 2 were on the machine together, the light was on. Removing either object 0 or object 2 turned the light off, confirming both are blickets.\n6. Object 3 was on the machine with other objects, but it never contributed to turning the light on when it was the only new addition.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not seem to have any effect on the machine's light, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
