Object 1 and object 2, when placed on the machine individually, turn the machine on. This suggests that both object 1 and object 2 are blickets.\n2. Object 3, when placed on the machine individually, does not turn the machine on. However, when object 3 is placed on the machine along with object 1 or object 2, the machine remains on. This suggests that object 3 does not affect the machine's state when combined with other blickets.\n3. Object 0, when placed on the machine individually, does not turn the machine on. It also does not affect the machine's state when combined with other objects.\n\nGiven this information, object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself, and it does not seem to contribute to turning the machine on when combined with other objects. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room.
