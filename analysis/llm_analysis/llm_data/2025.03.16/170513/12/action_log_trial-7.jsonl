Therefore, object 0 is a blicket.\n- Object 1, when placed on the machine alone, does not turn the light on. Therefore, object 1 is not a blicket.\n- Object 2, when placed on the machine alone, turns the light on. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket.\n- Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, turns the light on. Therefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\nThe machine turns on when any of the blickets (objects 0, 2, or 3) are on it. Object 1 does not affect the machine when placed alone, but the machine remains on when other blickets are present.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
