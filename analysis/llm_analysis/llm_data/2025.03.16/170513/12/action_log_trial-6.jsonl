Removing object 0 turns the light off, unless object 1 is also on the machine.\n- When object 1 is on the machine, the light turns on. Removing object 1 turns the light off, unless object 0 is also on the machine.\n- Object 2 does not affect the light; whether it is on or off the machine, the light remains off unless other objects are present.\n- Object 3 does not turn the light on when placed on the machine by itself.
