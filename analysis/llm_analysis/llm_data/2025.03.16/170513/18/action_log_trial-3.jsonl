From the tests conducted:\n\n- Object 3, 5, 6, and 7 turned the machine on when placed individually.\n- Objects 0, 1, 2, and 4 did not turn the machine on when placed individually.\n\nThis suggests that objects 3, 5, 6, and 7 might be blickets. To confirm this hypothesis, I should test combinations of objects to see if the machine turns on with any of the non-blicket candidates (0, 1, 2, 4) and a known blicket.
