Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself, but it does contribute to turning the machine on when combined with object 1. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket on its own, as it does not have the ability to turn the machine on without the presence of object 1.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
