When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n2. When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n3. When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n4.
