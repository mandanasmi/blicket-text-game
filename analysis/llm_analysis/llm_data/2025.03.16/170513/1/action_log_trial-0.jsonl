When object 2 is on the machine alone, the light is off. When object 3 is on the machine alone, the light is also off. However, when both objects 2 and 3 are on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that the rule for the machine to turn on is that both objects 2 and 3 need to be present together. Therefore, object 3 is a blicket because it is part of the combination that turns the machine on.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
