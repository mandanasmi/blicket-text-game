When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n2. When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on only if object 2 is already on the machine. This suggests that object 3 alone does not turn on the machine, so it is not a blicket.\n3. Object 1 seems to be a blicket because when it is placed on the machine, the light turns on, even without object 2.\n4.
