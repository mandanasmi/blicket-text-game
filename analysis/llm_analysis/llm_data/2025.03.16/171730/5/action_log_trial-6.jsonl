You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 with object 2 on the machine kept the light on, but removing object 3 turned the light off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 5 did not turn the light on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Re-testing Object 4**:\n   - When object 4 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on.\n   - Adding object 1 and object 2 with object 4 on the machine kept the light on, but object 4 alone was sufficient to turn the light on initially.\n\nFrom these observations, object 4 consistently turned the machine on when it was placed on the machine, and the light turned off when it was removed.
