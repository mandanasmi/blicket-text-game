When removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off.

This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Analysis of Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This indicates that object 3 has the ability to turn the machine on by itself, which is a characteristic of a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, further supporting that object 3 is a blicket because its presence directly affects the machine's state.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the observations, object 3 consistently turns the machine on when placed on it and turns it off when removed.
