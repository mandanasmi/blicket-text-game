You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, object 4 was on the machine, and the light was off. This suggests that object 4 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n2. After removing object 4, the light remained off, which is consistent with object 4 not being a blicket.\n\n3.

When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 3 is also a blicket.\n\n6. Adding object 5 to the machine while object 3 was on kept the light on, but removing object 3 turned the light off, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n7. Placing object 4 back on the machine with object 2 resulted in the light being on, but this is due to object 2 being a blicket, not object 4.\n\nFrom these observations, object 4 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, nor does it contribute to the machine's state when combined with other objects.

This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 0 and 1 while object 2 was on the machine did not turn off the light, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turned the light off, confirming object 2's status as a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3 and 5:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine turned the light on, suggesting object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Adding object 5 while object 3 was on the machine kept the light on, but this does not provide information about object 5 independently.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 5 was still on the machine kept the light on, suggesting object 5 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 5 turned the light off, confirming object 5's status as a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 4 Again:**\n   - Placing object 4 on the machine with object 2 turned the light on, but object 4 alone did not turn the light on, confirming object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 2 and object 5 are confirmed blickets because their presence on the machine independently turns the light on.\n- Object 5 is a blicket because when it was the only object on the machine, the light was on, and removing it turned the light off.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
