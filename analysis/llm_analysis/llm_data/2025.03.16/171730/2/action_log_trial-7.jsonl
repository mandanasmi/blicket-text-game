This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, but it also indicates that the machine might require more than one object to turn on.\n\n2. **Combination Tests:**\n   - When object 0 was on the machine, the light turned on. Removing object 1 turned the light off, but placing object 1 back on turned the light on again. This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, but removing it did not turn the light off, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on, but we haven't tested removing it yet.\n\n3. **Current Hypothesis:**\n   - Objects 0 and 1 are likely blickets, as their presence seems necessary for the machine to turn on.\n   - The rule might be that at least two specific objects (0 and 1) need to be on the machine for it to turn on.\n\n4. **Next Step:**\n   - To confirm the hypothesis, we should test the effect of removing object 3, as it is currently on the machine.

This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, but it didn't turn on the machine by itself initially.\n\n2. **Combination Tests:**\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine with all other objects, the machine turned on. This suggests that object 0 might be a necessary component for the machine to turn on, but not sufficient by itself.\n   - Removing object 1 turned the machine off, and placing it back turned the machine on again. This indicates that object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 2 and 3 did not turn the machine off, suggesting they are not necessary for the machine to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turned the machine off, confirming that object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. **Current Hypothesis:**\n   - Objects 0 and 1 are blickets. The machine turns on when both object 0 and object 1 are on the machine together.

This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects:**\n   - Objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are placed on the machine one by one, but the light remains off. This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine again, the light turns on, confirming object 0's status as a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine with object 0, and the light is on. When object 1 is removed, the light turns off, indicating object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is placed on the machine with object 1, and the light remains on. When object 2 is removed, the light remains on, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, and the light remains on. When object 3 is removed, the light remains on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Object 4:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that object 4 does not have the ability to turn the machine on by itself.\n   - There is no evidence from the interactions that object 4, when combined with other objects, affects the machine's state.\n\nBased on the above observations, object 4 does not appear to influence the machine's state, either alone or in combination with other objects.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
