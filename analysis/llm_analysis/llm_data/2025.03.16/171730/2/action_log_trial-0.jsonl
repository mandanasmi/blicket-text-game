Placing object 5 back on the machine turned it on again.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- Object 5 is a blicket because its presence on the machine is necessary and sufficient to turn the machine on.\n- The rule for the machine turning on seems to be that object 5 must be on the machine. No other object affects the machine's state.\n\nGiven this understanding, the next logical step is to confirm that object 5 is indeed the only blicket by ensuring no other combination of objects can turn the machine on without object 5.
