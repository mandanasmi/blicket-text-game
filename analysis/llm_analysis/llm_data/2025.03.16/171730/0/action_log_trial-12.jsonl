This suggests that object 5 has a unique property that the other objects do not have, which is causing the machine to turn on.\n- Since the light did not turn on with any of the other objects (0 to 4), it is unlikely that any of them are blickets, assuming a single-object rule.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that object 5 is a blicket, as it is the only object that caused the machine to turn on.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
