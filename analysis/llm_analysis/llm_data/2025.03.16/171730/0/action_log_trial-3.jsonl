Placing object 4 on the machine with object 1 turned the light on, suggesting object 4 might be a blicket, or it requires a combination with another object.\n\n8. Removing object 4 turned the light off, reinforcing that object 4 is crucial for turning the light on.\n\n9. Placing object 5 on the machine with object 1 did not turn the light on, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n10. Placing object 4 back on the machine with object 1 turned the light on again, confirming object 4 is a blicket.\n\n11. Removing object 1 turned the light off, suggesting that object 1 might be necessary in combination with object 4 to turn the light on.\n\n12.

However, since object 4 alone did not turn the light on, it suggests a combination rule.\n\nTo further test this, I will place object 4 on the machine alone to see if it turns the light on, confirming if object 4 is a blicket by itself or if it requires a combination.\n\n> put object 4 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
