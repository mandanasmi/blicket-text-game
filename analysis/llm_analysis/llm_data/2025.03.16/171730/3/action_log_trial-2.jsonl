This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - I removed object 2, and the machine turned off, further confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - I placed object 3 on the machine, and the machine turned on.

This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 4 because object 3 was already confirmed to be a blicket and was on the machine at the same time.\n   - After removing object 3, the light turned off, indicating that object 4 alone did not keep the machine on.
