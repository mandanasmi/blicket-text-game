However, since the light turned OFF when objects 0, 2, or 4 were removed, it suggests that object 5 is not necessary to turn the light ON.\n\nTherefore, object 5 is not a blicket because the light turned OFF when other objects (0, 2, 4) were removed, indicating those objects were responsible for turning the light ON, not object 5.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
