You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 kept the light on, but we don't know if object 3 is a blicket yet because object 2 was already on the machine.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Removing object 0 did not change the light status, confirming object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 while object 3 was still on the machine kept the light on, indicating that object 3 is also a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turned the light off, confirming that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing with New Objects:**\n   - Placing object 4 on the machine turned the light on, indicating that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 5 on the machine while object 4 was already on kept the light on. However, since object 4 is a confirmed blicket, we cannot determine if object 5 is a blicket from this alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turned on with object 4, and remained on with object 5, but since object 4 was already confirmed as a blicket, object 5's status is indeterminate from this test alone.\n   - To confirm if object 5 is a blicket, we would need to test it independently (i.e., with no other objects on the machine). However, based on the current information, we cannot definitively say object 5 is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the information gathered, object 5 cannot be confirmed as a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
