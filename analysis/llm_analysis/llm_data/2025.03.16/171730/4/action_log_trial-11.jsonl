This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on.

This further supports the idea that object 4 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 4 does not have the property of blicktness, as it does not turn the machine on when placed on it, either alone or in combination with other objects that have been tested.\n\nTherefore, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
