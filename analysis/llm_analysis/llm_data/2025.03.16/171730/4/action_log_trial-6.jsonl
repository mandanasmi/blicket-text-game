Object 1 was removed, and the light remained on, indicating that object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n5. Object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light stayed on. However, when object 5 was removed, the light turned off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n6. Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. However, when object 2 was removed, the light stayed on, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n7. Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light stayed on. Object 3's presence did not affect the light status when other objects were removed.\n8. Object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light stayed on. Object 4's presence did not affect the light status when other objects were removed.\n9. Object 5 was placed back on the machine, and the light turned on, confirming its role in turning the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that object 5 is crucial for the light to be on, as its presence consistently results in the light being on, and its removal results in the light turning off. Therefore, object 5 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 6 objects scattered around the room.
