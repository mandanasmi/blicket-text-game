You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When removed, the light turns off.\n   - Object 1: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off.\n   - Object 2: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off.\n   - Object 3: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off.\n   - Object 4: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off.\n   - Object 5: When placed on the machine, the light remains off.\n\n2. **Combination Observations:**\n   - When object 5 is on the machine alone, the light is off.\n   - When object 5 is on the machine with object 0, the light is on.\n   - When object 5 is on the machine with object 1, the light is off.\n   - When object 5 is on the machine with object 4, the light is on.\n   - When object 5 is on the machine with object 2, the light is on.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, when placed individually, turn the light on, indicating they are likely blickets.\n   - Object 5, when placed individually, does not turn the light on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - The light turns on when object 5 is combined with other objects that are already known to be blickets (e.g., objects 0, 2, 4), but this does not provide evidence that object 5 is a blicket itself.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 5 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, which suggests it is not a blicket. The light turning on in combination with other objects is due to those other objects being blickets.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
