This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects:**\n   - Object 1 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on. This suggests object 4 might be a blicket, but we need more information.\n   - Object 3 was removed, and the light turned off. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 4 was removed, and the light remained on. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket, as its removal did not affect the light status.\n   - Object 0 was placed back on the machine, and the light remained on. This confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Objects 0, 3, and 5 are confirmed to be blickets because their presence on the machine turns the light on.\n- Objects 1, 2, and 4 are not blickets because their presence does not turn the light on, or their removal does not turn the light off.\n\nTherefore, object 5 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
