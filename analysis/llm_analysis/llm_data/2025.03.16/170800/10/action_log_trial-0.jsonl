This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n   - When object 4 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - When object 5 was added to the machine with object 4, the light remained on. This suggests that object 5 might also be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - After removing object 4, the light turned off, even though object 5 was still on the machine. This suggests that object 5 alone does not turn the light on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on.
