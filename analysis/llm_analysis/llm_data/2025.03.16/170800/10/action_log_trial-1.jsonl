You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1, when placed on the machine, also turns the light on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2, when placed on the machine, turns the light on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine, turns the light on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Removing objects 3, 2, and 1 sequentially while object 0 is on the machine keeps the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - After removing object 0, the light turns off, confirming that object 1 alone can turn the light on, thus object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 4, 5, 6, and 7, when placed on the machine, do not turn the light on. This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n\n3. **Testing with Multiple Objects:**\n   - Placing object 0 and object 1 together turns the light on, but since both are already identified as blickets, this does not provide new information about object 7.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since placing object 7 on the machine does not turn the light on, and placing it with other non-blicket objects (4, 5, 6) also does not turn the light on, object 7 does not have the property of blicktness.\n   - The machine only turns on with objects 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating these are the blickets.\n\nTherefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
