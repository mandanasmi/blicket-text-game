When object 2 was placed on the machine along with objects 0 and 1, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. After removing object 0, the light remained on, confirming that object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n4. When object 2 was removed, the light turned off, reinforcing that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n5. Placing object 3 back on the machine did not turn the light on, confirming again that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n6. When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 6 could be a blicket.\n\n7. Removing object 4 did not affect the light status, indicating that object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n8. Placing object 7 on the machine with object 6 kept the light on, but when object 6 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 6 is indeed a blicket, as its presence was necessary to keep the light on.\n\n9. Finally, placing object 2 back on the machine turned the light on again, confirming object 2's status as a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 6 is a blicket because its presence on the machine was necessary to turn the light on, and removing it turned the light off.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
