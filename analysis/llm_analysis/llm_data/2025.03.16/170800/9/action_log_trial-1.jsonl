This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turned the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 also turned the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket on its own.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Objects 4 and 5 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off, suggesting they are not blickets.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on, suggesting object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was added, and the light stayed on, suggesting object 7 might also be a blicket.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Rule:**\n   - The machine turns on with object 2 alone, indicating object 2 is a definite blicket.\n   - The machine turns on with object 6 alone, indicating object 6 is a definite blicket.\n   - The machine turns on with object 7 when object 6 is already on, suggesting object 7 might be a blicket or it might be that the machine requires at least one blicket to be on for additional objects to have an effect.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Objects 2 and 6 are confirmed blickets.\n   - Object 7 might be a blicket, but further testing is needed to confirm if it can turn the machine on by itself.\n\nGiven the steps and observations, the rule seems to be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it. Objects 2 and 6 are confirmed blickets. Object 7's status is uncertain without further testing.\n\nTo confirm object 7's status, I would remove all objects and test object 7 alone.
