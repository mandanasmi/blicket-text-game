You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Initially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was on. When object 1 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. Similarly, objects 2, 3, 4, and 5 were placed on the machine one by one, and the light remained off each time, indicating none of these objects are blickets.\n\n4. When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating object 6 is a blicket.\n\n5. When object 7 was placed on the machine with object 6 already on it, the light remained on. However, when object 6 was removed, the light turned off, suggesting that object 7 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n6. When object 1 was placed on the machine again, the light turned on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n\n7. After removing object 1, the light turned off, and when object 7 was removed, the light remained off. This further supports that object 7 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n8. Finally, placing object 6 back on the machine turned the light on again, confirming object 6 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on. The light only turned on when object 6 or object 1 was on the machine, and object 7 did not affect the light status when placed alone.\n\nTherefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
