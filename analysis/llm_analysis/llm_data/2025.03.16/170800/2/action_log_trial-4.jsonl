You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1, object 2, or object 3 is placed on the machine individually, the light does not turn on. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets on their own.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - When object 0 is on the machine, the light is on. Adding object 1 or object 2 does not change the state of the light, indicating they do not affect the machine.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0, the light remains on. However, when object 0 is removed and only object 3 is on the machine, the light turns off. This indicates that object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\n3. **Final Test with Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket, as it can independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can independently cause the machine to turn on when placed on it.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
