Initially, object 2 was on the machine, and the light was on. When object 2 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n2. When object 2 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on again, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. When object 0 was placed on the machine with object 2, the light remained on. However, when object 2 was removed, leaving only object 0, the light turned off. This indicates that object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n4. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, suggesting that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n5. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also remained off, indicating that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 3 is not a blicket because its presence on the machine did not turn the light on, either alone or in combination with other non-blicket objects.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
