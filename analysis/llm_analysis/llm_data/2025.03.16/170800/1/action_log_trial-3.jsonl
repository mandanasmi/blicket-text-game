Initially, all objects were on the floor, and the machine's light was off.\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n3. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n4. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n5. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n6. After removing object 0, the light stayed on, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n7. After removing object 1, the light turned off, suggesting object 1 is a blicket.\n8. Placing object 1 back on the machine turned the light on again, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n9. Removing object 1 turned the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is necessary to turn the light on.\n10. Removing object 3 turned the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket because the light was off when only object 3 was on the machine.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 1 is the blicket, as it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.
