Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine and the resulting light status.\n\n1. Initially, object 3 was on the machine, and the light was off. When object 3 was removed, the light remained off. This doesn't provide information about object 3's status as a blicket.\n\n2. Object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. Object 1 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n4. Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n5. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket, as it was the only object that caused the machine to turn on.\n\n6. Removing object 3 turned the light off, and placing it back on turned the light on again. This consistent behavior strongly suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is the only object that consistently causes the machine to turn on, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
