You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Removing object 1 (leaving object 2) kept the light on, indicating object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turned the light off, confirming object 2's status as a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine turned the light on, suggesting object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 back on the machine with object 3 kept the light on. Removing object 2 left the light on, indicating object 3 can independently turn the light on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 2 is confirmed as a blicket because it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - Object 3 also turns the light on when placed on the machine, even without object 2 present. This indicates that object 3 is not independent of the machine's state and has a nonzero mutual information with the machine's state.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
