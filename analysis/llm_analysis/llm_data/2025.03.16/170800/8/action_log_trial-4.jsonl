You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine, specifically focusing on when the machine's light turns on or off.\n\n1. **Initial Observations:**\n   - Object 0: Placing it on the machine does not turn the light on.\n   - Object 1: Placing it on the machine turns the light on.\n   - Object 2: Placing it on the machine turns the light on.\n   - Object 3: Placing it on the machine turns the light on.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Removing object 1 while object 2 is on the machine turns the light off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 2 is on the machine turns the light off, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Object 3 independently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, which means it has a direct effect on the machine's state.\n   - The machine's light turns on with object 3 alone, confirming that object 3 is not independent of the machine's state.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is indeed a blicket because it directly influences the machine's state by turning the light on when placed on the machine.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
