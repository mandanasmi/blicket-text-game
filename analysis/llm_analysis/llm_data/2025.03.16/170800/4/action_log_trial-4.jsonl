Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine:\n\n1. Initially, all objects (0 through 7) were placed on the machine one by one, and the machine's light remained off until object 7 was placed on it. At this point, the light turned on. This suggests that object 7 might be a blicket.\n\n2. After placing all objects on the machine, I started removing them one by one. When object 0 was removed, the light stayed on, indicating that object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. When object 7 was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 7 is crucial for the machine to turn on, suggesting that it is indeed a blicket.\n\n4. Placing object 7 back on the machine turned the light on again, reinforcing the idea that object 7 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 is the only object that, when placed on the machine, causes the light to turn on. Therefore, object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 8 objects scattered around the room.
