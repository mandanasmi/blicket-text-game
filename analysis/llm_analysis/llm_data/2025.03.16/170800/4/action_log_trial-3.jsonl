You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Object 6**:\n   - When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 is likely a blicket because it caused the machine to activate.\n\n3. **Object 7**:\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. However, when object 6 was removed, leaving only object 7, the light turned off. This suggests that object 7 alone is not a blicket, and the machine was on due to object 6.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The machine turned on only when object 6 was on it, either alone or with object 7. The fact that the light turned off when object 6 was removed confirms that object 6 is necessary for the machine to turn on.
