When object 5 was added, the light turned on, indicating object 5 is a blicket.\n5. Removing object 5 turned the light off, confirming object 5 is necessary to turn the light on.\n6. Adding objects 6 and 7 did not turn the light on, suggesting they are not blickets.\n7. When object 5 was added again, the light did not turn on. This suggests that the rule might involve a specific combination or sequence of objects, or that the machine has a reset condition.\n\nGiven that object 5 is the only object that turned the light on, it is likely a blicket. However, the fact that the light did not turn on when object 5 was added again suggests there might be a more complex rule, such as requiring a specific sequence or combination of objects.\n\nTo further investigate, I will try removing all objects and then adding object 5 alone to see if the machine turns on, confirming if object 5 alone is sufficient or if another condition is needed.\n\n> take object 4 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
