When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 has the property of blicktness, as it caused the machine to turn on.\n\n3. Object 7 was then placed on the machine, and the light remained on. However, since the light was already on due to object 6, we cannot conclude anything about object 7 from this action alone.\n\n4. When object 0 was removed from the machine, the light remained on, which is expected since object 0 was not a blicket.\n\n5. When object 6 was removed from the machine, the light turned off. This strongly suggests that object 6 is indeed a blicket, as its removal directly caused the machine to turn off.\n\n6. Finally, when object 7 was removed, the light remained off, which is consistent with the idea that object 7 is not a blicket, as it did not affect the machine's state when object 6 was not present.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 6 is a blicket because its presence on the machine turned the light on, and its removal turned the light off.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

However, since object 6 was already on the machine and the light was on, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket based solely on this observation.\n\n4.

This confirms that object 6 is indeed a blicket, as its removal directly affected the machine's state.\n\n6. After removing object 7, the light remained off. This suggests that object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, as its removal did not change the machine's state when object 6 was already removed.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket because its presence or absence does not independently affect the machine's state.
