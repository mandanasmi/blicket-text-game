You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that object 7 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Testing Other Objects**: \n   - Object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were placed on the machine individually, and the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Final Test with Object 7**: After testing all objects, object 7 was placed on the machine again, and the light remained off. This confirms that object 7 does not have the property of turning the machine on by itself.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 7 does not affect the machine's state and is not a blicket. A blicket is defined as an object whose presence is not independent of the machine's state, meaning it should turn the machine on when placed on it. Since object 7 does not turn the machine on, it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
