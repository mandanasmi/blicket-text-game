You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 0, 1, and 2 did not affect the light, confirming they are not blickets.\n   - Removing object 3 turned the light off, reinforcing that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 5 on the machine turned the light on, suggesting object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 6 on the machine while object 5 was on did not change the light, but removing object 6 did not turn the light off, suggesting object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 7 on the machine while object 5 was on did not change the light, but removing object 5 turned the light off, indicating object 5 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine with object 5, and the light remained on.\n   - Removing object 5 turned the light off, even though object 7 was still on the machine.\n   - This indicates that object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on with object 3 or object 5, but not with object 7 alone.\n   - Object 7 does not affect the machine's state independently, meaning it does not have the property of blicktness.\n\nTherefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
