This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Tests:**\n   - After placing object 1 on the machine, the light remained on. However, when object 0 was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 0 was necessary for the light to be on, reinforcing the idea that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - When object 0 was placed back on the machine later, the light turned on again. This consistent behavior further supports the conclusion that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Objects:**\n   - Objects 2, 6, and 7 did not turn the light on when placed on the machine, suggesting they are not blickets.\n   - Objects 1, 3, 4, and 5 also interacted with the machine, but the key observation is that the light turned off when object 0 was removed, even if other objects were present. This indicates that object 0 has a unique effect on the machine.\n\nBased on these observations, object 0 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, and the machine turns off when object 0 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This behavior is indicative of object 0 being a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When any of these objects are on the machine, the light turns on or remains on.\n   - Objects 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 do not independently turn the light on. Specifically, when object 7 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating it does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - A blicket is defined as an object whose presence affects the state of the machine (i.e., turns the light on). Since object 7 does not turn the light on when placed on the machine, it does not have the property of a blicket.\n\nTherefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
