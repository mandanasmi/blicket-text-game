You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 5 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. When object 5 was placed on the machine with no other objects, the light turned on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket.\n2. When object 5 was removed while other objects were on the machine, the light remained on, indicating that those other objects (such as object 3) might also be blickets.\n3. When object 5 was placed on the machine with other objects, the light remained on, but this doesn't contradict the possibility of object 5 being a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 5 appears to be a blicket because it can independently turn the machine on.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
