You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Initially, the machine was on with object 3 on it. Removing object 3 turned the machine off, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n2. Placing object 0 on the machine turned it on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n3. Placing object 1 on the machine with object 0 kept it on, but removing object 0 turned it off, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n4. Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the machine stayed off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n5. Placing object 4 on the machine with object 3 turned it on, but removing object 3 turned it off, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n6. Object 5 was placed on the machine, and the machine stayed off, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, object 5 does not seem to have any effect on the machine when placed alone or with other non-blicket objects.
