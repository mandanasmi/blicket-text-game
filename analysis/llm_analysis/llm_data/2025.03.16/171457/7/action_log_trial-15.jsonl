When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. Removing object 0 turned the light off, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. Removing object 1 turned the light off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n3. Object 2 did not turn the light on when placed alone, but when combined with other objects, it sometimes did. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n4. Object 3 did not turn the light on when placed alone, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n5. Object 4 did not turn the light on when placed alone, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n6.
