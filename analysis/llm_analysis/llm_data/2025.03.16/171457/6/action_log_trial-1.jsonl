The machine turns on when object 0, 1, or 2 is placed on it individually, indicating these are blickets.\n2. The machine does not turn on when object 3, 4, or 5 is placed on it individually, indicating these are not blickets.\n3. When object 0 is on the machine, adding object 3, 4, or 5 does not turn the machine off, but these objects alone do not turn the machine on.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that object 5 is not a blicket because it does not turn the machine on when placed on it individually.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
