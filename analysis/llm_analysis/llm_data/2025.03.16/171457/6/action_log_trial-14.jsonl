When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n2. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n3. When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n4. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light did not turn on unless other objects were already on the machine. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n5. When object 2 and object 4 were placed on the machine, the light did not turn on.
