Initially, object 5 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When object 5 was put on the machine with other objects (like object 0 or object 1), the light turned on, but this was due to the presence of other objects, not object 5 itself.\n3. When object 5 was on the machine alone, the light remained off.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 5 does not independently cause the machine to turn on. Therefore, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 6 objects scattered around the room.
