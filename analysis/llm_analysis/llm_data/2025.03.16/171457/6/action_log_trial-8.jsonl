You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Initially, the machine was on with objects 1 and 2 on it. Removing object 1 kept the machine on, but removing object 2 turned it off. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine, it stayed off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. Placing object 3 on the machine turned it on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. Placing object 4 on the machine while it was off turned it on, suggesting object 4 is a blicket.\n\n5. Placing object 5 on the machine while it was off did not turn it on, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n6. Further tests with combinations of objects confirmed that the machine turns on with objects 2, 3, or 4, but not with object 5.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
