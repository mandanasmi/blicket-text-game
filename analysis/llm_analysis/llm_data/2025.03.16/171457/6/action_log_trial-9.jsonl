When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light stayed off. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n4. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light stayed off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n5. When object 4 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 4 is a blicket.\n6. When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n\nThe machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it.
