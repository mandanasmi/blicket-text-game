You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 5 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket.\n2. When object 5 was removed while object 2 was on the machine, the light remained on, which is consistent with object 2 also being a blicket.\n3. When object 5 was placed on the machine with other objects that did not turn the light on by themselves (like object 4), the light turned on, further supporting that object 5 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 5 has the property of turning the machine on, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
