When object 4 was placed on the machine with object 3, the light was off. Since object 3 alone also did not turn the light on, this suggests that object 4 is not a blicket.\n3. When object 4 was placed on the machine with object 3 and object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 4 did not contribute to turning the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 4 does not have the property of a blicket, as it does not independently or in combination with non-blickets turn the machine on.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
