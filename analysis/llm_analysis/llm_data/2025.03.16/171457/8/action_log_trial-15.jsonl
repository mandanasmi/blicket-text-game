You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 6 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor, object 4 is on the floor, object 5 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting.

When object 1 is on the machine, the light turns on. Removing object 1 turns the light off. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n2. When object 2 is on the machine, the light turns on. Removing object 2 turns the light off. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n3. When object 3 is on the machine, the light turns on. Removing object 3 turns the light off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n4. When object 4 is on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n5. When object 5 is on the machine, the light remains off unless another blicket (like object 3) is also on the machine. This suggests object 5 is not a blicket.\n6. Object 0 does not seem to affect the machine's state independently, as the light remains off when it is the only object on the machine.\n\nBased on these observations, object 5 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
