You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, placing each object individually on the machine (objects 0 to 5) did not turn the machine on.\n2. When objects 0, 1, 2, and 3 were placed on the machine together, the machine turned on. Removing object 0 turned the machine off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n3. Placing objects 3, 4, and 5 together did not turn the machine on.\n4. Placing objects 0, 2, and 3 together turned the machine on, but removing object 0 turned it off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n5. Placing objects 2 and 3 together did not turn the machine on, but adding object 0 turned it on, suggesting object 0 is necessary for the machine to turn on with objects 2 and 3.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 0 is necessary for the machine to turn on, but it is not a blicket by itself.
