You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When object 0 is on the machine alone, the machine turns on, but when object 3 is on the machine alone, the machine does not turn on. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket, and object 3 is not a blicket by itself but contributes to turning on the machine when combined with object 0.\n\nObject 5 was placed on the machine with object 4, and the machine did not turn on. Object 5 was not tested in combination with object 0 or object 3, but since object 0 alone can turn on the machine, and object 5 did not turn on the machine when placed alone or with object 4, it is unlikely that object 5 is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the information collected, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
