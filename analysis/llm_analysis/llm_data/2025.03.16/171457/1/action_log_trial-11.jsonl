When object 3 is on the machine alone, the light is off. However, when object 3 is combined with other objects, the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 is a necessary component for the machine to turn on, but it requires at least one other object to activate the machine.\n\nObject 5 was tested alone and did not turn the machine on. Since the machine requires object 3 and at least one other object to turn on, and object 5 alone did not activate the machine, we cannot definitively say that object 5 is a blicket based on the current information. \n\nTherefore, based on the information collected, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
