You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, the machine was off with object 2 on it.\n2. Adding objects 0, 1, 3, and 4 did not turn the machine on.\n3. When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n4. Adding object 6 and 7 while object 5 was on the machine did not change the state (the light remained on).\n5. Removing object 5 turned the light off, even when object 6 and 7 were still on the machine.\n6. Placing object 5 back on the machine turned the light on again, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 5 is necessary to turn the machine on. The presence of object 6 and 7 did not independently affect the machine's state when object 5 was removed. Therefore, object 7 does not seem to have any effect on the machine's state and is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
