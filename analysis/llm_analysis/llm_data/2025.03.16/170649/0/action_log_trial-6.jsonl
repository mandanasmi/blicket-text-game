You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it.

No other object, when placed alone on the machine, turned the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 3 is necessary and sufficient to turn the machine on, indicating that it is a blicket.
