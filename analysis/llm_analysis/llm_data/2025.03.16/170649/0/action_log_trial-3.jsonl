When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light remained off initially, but when combined with object 1, the light turned on.\n4. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n5. When object 2 was placed on the machine with object 1 already there, the light turned on.\n6. Removing object 1 while object 2 was still on the machine kept the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 2 is a blicket, as it is the only object that, when placed on the machine, results in the light turning on. Object 1 does not appear to be a blicket, as its presence or absence does not affect the light when object 2 is on the machine. Objects 0 and 3 also do not seem to be blickets, as they do not turn the light on in any combination tested so far.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that object 2 must be on the machine.

However, there is an interesting observation: when object 2 is on the machine with object 3, the machine stays on, but when object 3 is removed, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 3 might also be a blicket, but it only works in conjunction with object 2.\n\nThe current hypothesis is that the machine turns on when object 2 is on it, and object 3 might be a conditional blicket that requires object 2 to be present to activate the machine. Object 0 and object 1 do not seem to affect the machine's state when placed on it alone or with other objects.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test object 3 alone on the machine to see if it turns on.
