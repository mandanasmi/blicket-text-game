Objects 0 and 1 do not turn the machine on by themselves, but they do not prevent the machine from being on when combined with objects 2 or 3.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that at least one blicket (object 2 or 3) must be on the machine. The presence of non-blicket objects (0 and 1) does not affect the machine's state if a blicket is present.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test combinations of objects to ensure that the presence of either object 2 or 3 is necessary and sufficient for the machine to turn on.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
