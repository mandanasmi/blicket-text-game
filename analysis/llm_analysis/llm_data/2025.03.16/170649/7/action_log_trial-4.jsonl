You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n4. After removing objects 0, 1, and 2, the light remained on with object 3 still on the machine. This further supports the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n5. Removing object 3 turned the light off, confirming that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, at least in the absence of object 2.\n\n6. Placing object 2 back on the machine turned the light on again, and removing it turned the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n7. Placing object 3 back on the machine turned the light on, and adding object 2 kept the light on, which is consistent with both objects being blickets.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is indeed a blicket because it independently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
