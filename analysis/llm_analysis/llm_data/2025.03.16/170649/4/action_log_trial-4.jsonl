Object 1 also seems to be a blicket because the machine turns on when both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine, but not when object 1 is alone. This suggests that the rule might involve needing at least two blickets on the machine to turn it on.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test if the machine turns on with any other combination of two objects. If the machine turns on with any other pair, it would suggest that the rule is indeed needing at least two blickets. If it doesn't, it might mean that only specific combinations work, or that only object 6 is a blicket and the rule is more complex.\n\nI will test this by putting object 4 on the machine along with object 6, since object 4 was initially on the machine and might be a blicket.

This suggests that object 1 is a blicket, and the rule for the machine turning on might be that object 1 must be present. Object 6 might not be a blicket on its own, but it could be part of a combination that turns the machine on when object 1 is also present.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test object 1 alone again to ensure it consistently turns the machine on, and then test object 6 alone to see if it ever turns the machine on by itself. However, given the consistent results so far, I am confident that object 1 is a blicket and the rule involves object 1 being present.\n\nPotential issues: I have not tested all objects in combination with object 1, but given the consistent results with object 1, it seems likely that it is the key to turning the machine on.\n\nFinal command to confirm object 1's status as a blicket:\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
