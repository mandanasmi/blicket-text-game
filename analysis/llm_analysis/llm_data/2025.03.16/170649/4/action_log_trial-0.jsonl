You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Initially, objects 0 through 7 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off.\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on.\n3. When object 0 was removed, the light turned off.\n4. Placing object 1 on the machine alone did not turn the light on.\n5. Placing object 0 back on the machine turned the light on again.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 0 is a blicket because it consistently turns the machine on when placed on it alone. \n\nHowever, object 7 was placed on the machine along with other objects, and the light remained off.
