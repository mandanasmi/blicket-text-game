Object 3 appears to be a non-blicket that can only turn the machine on when combined with a blicket.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be on the machine. If a blicket is present, the machine turns on regardless of any non-blickets present.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test object 3 with another object that is not a blicket (e.g., object 0) to ensure it doesn't turn the machine on.
