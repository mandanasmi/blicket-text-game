Initially, objects 0, 3, and 5 were on the machine, and the light was on.\n2. Removing objects 0 and 3 did not turn off the light, but removing object 5 did. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket.\n3. When object 5 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on again, confirming object 5's status as a blicket.\n4. Placing objects 1, 2, 6, and 7 on the machine did not turn the light on, indicating they are not blickets.\n5. Placing object 4 on the machine turned the light on, but removing it did not turn the light off, suggesting object 4 is not a blicket, and the light was on due to object 5.\n\nFrom this analysis, object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light did not turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
