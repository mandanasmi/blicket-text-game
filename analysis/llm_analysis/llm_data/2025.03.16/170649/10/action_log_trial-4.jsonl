When both objects 3 and 4 are on the machine, the light remains on, which is consistent with both being blickets.\n4. Objects 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 do not turn the light on when placed on the machine alone, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule for the machine turning on is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. Objects 3 and 4 are confirmed blickets, as they independently turn the machine on.\n\nTo further confirm this rule, I should test if the machine turns on with only object 4 on it, as I have already confirmed object 3's effect. However, I have already done this, and the light turned on with object 4 alone. \n\nTherefore, I am confident in my conclusion that objects 3 and 4 are blickets, and the rule is that at least one blicket must be on the machine for it to turn on.\n\nI will now exit the task as I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
