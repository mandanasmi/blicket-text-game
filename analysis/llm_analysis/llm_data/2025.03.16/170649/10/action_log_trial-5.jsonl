The rule seems to be that any single blicket can turn the machine on, and non-blickets do not affect the machine's state when combined with blickets.\n\nTo confirm this, I should test if any combination of non-blickets can turn the machine on, which would suggest a more complex rule. However, given the current evidence, it seems that the rule is straightforward: any single blicket can turn the machine on.\n\nNext, I will test a combination of non-blickets to ensure they do not turn the machine on.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
