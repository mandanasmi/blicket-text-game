Initially, when object 0 and object 1 were on the machine, the light was off.\n2. When object 2 was added to the machine with object 0, the light turned on. This suggests object 2 might be a blicket.\n3. When object 3 was on the machine with object 0, the light was off.\n4. When object 2 was on the machine alone, the light turned on, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n5. Object 3 was on the machine with object 0, and the light was off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n6. Object 2 consistently turned the light on, whether alone or with other objects, indicating it is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 never caused the machine to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects.
