When object 0 was placed on the machine with object 3, the light was on, but when object 3 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 alone does not turn on the machine, but it might work in combination with object 3.\n3. Object 1 and object 2 have been placed on the machine, but they did not turn the light on, either alone or in combination with other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 3 is a blicket, and it might be the only blicket, or it might work in combination with object 0. To further test this, I should try placing object 0 and object 3 together on the machine again to confirm if the light turns on, and then test object 0 alone to see if it ever turns the light on by itself.\n\nHowever, since I have already tested object 0 alone and it did not turn the light on, I should focus on confirming the combination rule. I will place object 3 on the machine first, then add object 0 to see if the light turns on, confirming the combination rule.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
