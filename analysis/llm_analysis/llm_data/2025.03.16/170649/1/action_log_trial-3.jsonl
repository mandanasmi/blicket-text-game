Object 0 also seems to be a blicket, as the machine turns on when both object 0 and object 1 are on the machine together. However, object 0 alone does not turn the machine on, suggesting that the rule might involve a combination of objects.\n\nThe current hypothesis is that the machine turns on when object 1 is on it, either alone or in combination with object 0. Objects 2 and 3 do not seem to affect the machine, as they have been tested and did not turn the machine on.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test object 0 and object 1 together again to ensure that the machine turns on with this combination, reinforcing the idea that object 1 is the key blicket, and object 0 might be a secondary blicket that works in combination with object 1.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
