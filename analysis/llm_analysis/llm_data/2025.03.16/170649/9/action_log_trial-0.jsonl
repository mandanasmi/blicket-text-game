Here's what I've observed:\n\n1. The machine turns on with object 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n2. The machine does not turn on with object 0 or 1.\n3. The machine turns off when object 3 is removed, even if other objects are on it.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 3 is a necessary blicket for the machine to turn on. Additionally, objects 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 also seem to be blickets, as they can turn the machine on when combined with object 3.\n\nThe rule might be that object 3 is a key blicket, and any combination of object 3 with other blickets (2, 4, 5, 6, 7) will turn the machine on. Objects 0 and 1 are not blickets.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will remove object 3 and see if the machine turns off, which would further support the idea that object 3 is necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
