You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Removing object 2 turned the light off, indicating object 2 is a blicket.\n2. When object 2 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n3. Object 6 was placed on the machine alone, and the light remained off, indicating object 6 is not a blicket.\n4. Objects 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 were placed on the machine individually, and the light remained off, indicating they are not blickets.\n5. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. Adding object 7 to the machine with object 2 kept the light on.\n6. Removing object 2 while object 7 was on the machine kept the light on, indicating object 7 is a blicket.\n7. Removing object 7 turned the light off, confirming object 7 is a blicket.\n\nThe reasoning shows that object 7 is indeed a blicket because it can turn the machine on by itself.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
