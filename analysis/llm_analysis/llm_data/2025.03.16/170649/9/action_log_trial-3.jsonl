Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Reflecting on the collected information:\n\n1. Initially, object 7 was on the machine, and the light was on. When object 7 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 7 might be a blicket.\n\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, suggesting object 1 is a blicket.\n\n4. Removing object 1 turned the light off, confirming object 1's status as a blicket.\n\n5. Objects 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off for each, indicating none of these are blickets.\n\n6. When object 7 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on again, reinforcing the idea that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n7.
