Initially, when object 6 was placed on the machine along with objects 4 and 5, the machine turned on. When object 6 was removed, the machine turned off, even though objects 4 and 5 were still on the machine. This suggests that object 6 is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\nFurther testing showed that placing object 6 on the machine alone did not turn the machine on, but when object 6 was placed on the machine with object 5, the machine turned on. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket, but it requires another specific object (in this case, object 5) to activate the machine.\n\nTherefore, based on the collected information, object 6 is indeed a blicket, as it is involved in the activation of the machine when combined with another object.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
