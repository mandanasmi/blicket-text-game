You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, when object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine with object 3, the light remained on. This doesn't change the status of object 3.\n3. When object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 1 is necessary for the machine to be on.\n4. When object 3 was removed, the light turned off, but this was after object 1 was already removed, so it doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n5. When object 3 was placed on the machine alone, the light was off, indicating that object 3 alone does not turn on the machine.\n6. When object 1 was placed on the machine with object 3, the light turned on again, reinforcing that object 1 is necessary.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 3 alone does not turn on the machine, and the machine only turns on when object 1 is present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket because it does not independently affect the machine's state.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
