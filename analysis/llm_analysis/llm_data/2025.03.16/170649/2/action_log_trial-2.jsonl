Initially, object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off.\n2. When object 1 was added, the light turned on. Removing object 0 turned the light off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n3. Object 2 and object 3 were placed on the machine individually, and the light remained off in both cases.\n4. Object 1 was repeatedly tested and consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine, confirming it as a blicket.\n5. Object 0 was tested again with object 1, and the light turned on, but when object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n\nSince object 3 was placed on the machine and the light did not turn on, and given that the light only turned on with object 1, it suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the consistent behavior of the machine, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
