Object 2 does not affect the machine's state, so it is not a blicket.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that at least one blicket must be on the machine for the light to turn on. This is supported by the fact that the light turns off when all blickets are removed, and turns on when any one of them is placed on the machine.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test a scenario where only object 2 is on the machine, ensuring the light remains off, and then add one of the known blickets to see if the light turns on. However, given the current observations, I am confident in my conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I will exit the task as I believe I have identified the blickets and the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
