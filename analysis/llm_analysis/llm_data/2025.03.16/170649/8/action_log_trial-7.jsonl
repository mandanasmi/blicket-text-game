You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. Removing object 0 turned the light off. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. When object 1 was added to the machine with object 0, the light remained on. However, when object 0 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 1 alone does not keep the light on.

When object 3 was placed on the machine with object 2, the light remained on. However, when object 2 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 3 alone does not keep the light on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nThe potential issue in reasoning could be if there is a more complex rule involving combinations of objects, but based on the current observations, the simplest explanation is that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
