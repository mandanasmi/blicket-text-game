Since the machine turns on with any of the objects 1, 4, 5, 6, or 7, these objects are likely the blickets.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test combinations of non-blicket candidates (0, 2, 3) with known blickets to ensure they don't affect the machine's state independently. However, given the current observations, I am confident in my hypothesis.\n\nNow, I will test one more combination to confirm my hypothesis.
