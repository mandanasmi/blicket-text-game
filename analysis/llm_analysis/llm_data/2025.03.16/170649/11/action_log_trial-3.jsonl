You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Initially, the machine was on with objects 1 and 5 on it. Removing object 1 kept the machine on, but removing object 5 turned it off. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket, and object 5 is not necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 0 is also a blicket.\n\n3. When object 5 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on, but when it was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 5 is not a blicket on its own, but it might be part of a combination that turns the machine on.\n\n4. Placing objects 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 on the machine did not turn the light on, indicating they are not blickets.\n\n5.

Object 5 does not seem to be a blicket, as it does not independently turn the machine on.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test placing object 0 back on the machine to see if the light turns on with object 1 still on it.
