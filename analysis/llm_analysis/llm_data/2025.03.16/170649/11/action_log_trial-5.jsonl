Here's a summary of the observations:\n\n1. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n2. **Object 4**: When placed on the machine alone, the light remains off. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n3. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n4. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n5. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n6. **Objects 5, 6, 7**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the machine turns on if at least one of the objects 0, 1, 2, or 3 is on the machine. The rule could be that any of these objects can independently turn the machine on.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test combinations of objects to ensure that the presence of any one of these objects is sufficient to turn the machine on. However, given the constraints, I will proceed with the assumption that objects 0, 1, 2, and 3 are blickets, and the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\n\nI will now exit the game as I believe I have identified the blickets and the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
