Initially, when each object was placed on the machine individually (objects 0 to 5), the machine's light did not turn on. This suggests that no single object is a blicket on its own.\n\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine again, the light turned on, but only after object 5 was also on the machine. This suggests that object 0 and object 5 together might be required to turn the machine on.\n\n3. When object 5 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 5 is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\n4. When object 0 was placed back on the machine with object 5, the light turned on again, reinforcing the idea that both objects 0 and 5 together are needed to activate the machine.\n\n5. Object 2 was on the machine at various times, but the light never turned on when it was on the machine alone or with other objects, except when object 5 was involved.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that object 2 is not a blicket because it does not contribute to turning the machine on in any observed combination.

Initially, when each object was placed on the machine individually (objects 0 to 5), the machine did not turn on. This suggests that no single object is a blicket on its own.\n\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine again, the machine turned on. However, when object 5 was removed, the machine turned off. This indicates that object 5 might be a necessary component for the machine to turn on, possibly in combination with another object.\n\n3. When object 5 was placed on the machine with object 0, the machine turned on. Removing object 0 turned the machine off, suggesting that both objects 0 and 5 together might be required to turn the machine on.\n\n4. Object 4 was placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, but the machine never turned on when object 4 was involved.
