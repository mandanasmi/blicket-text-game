Placing objects 0, 1, 2, and 3 on the machine individually did not turn the light on.\n4. Placing object 4 on the machine did not turn the light on.\n5.

Removing object 3 while object 5 was on the machine turned the light off.\n8.

Object 5 also seems to be a blicket because it turns the light on when placed on the machine, but only when object 3 is not present.\n\nObject 4, however, does not turn the light on when placed on the machine, either alone or with other objects.
