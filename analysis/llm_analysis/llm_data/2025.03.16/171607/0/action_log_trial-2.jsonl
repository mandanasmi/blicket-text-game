Object 0 might also be a blicket, or it might be that object 3 alone is sufficient to turn the machine on, but object 0 was coincidentally on the machine when it turned on.\n\nTo confirm this, I should test object 3 alone on the machine to see if it turns on. If it does, then object 3 is a blicket, and the rule is that object 3 alone can turn the machine on.

Placing objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 on the machine in various combinations showed that:\n   - The light turned on when object 0 was placed on the machine with object 3.\n   - The light turned off when object 0 was removed, even if object 3 was still on the machine.\n   - The light turned on again when object 0 was placed back on the machine with object 3.\n4. Object 4 was placed on the machine multiple times, but it never caused the light to turn on by itself or in combination with other objects, except when object 0 was present.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 0 is a necessary component for the machine to turn on, and object 3 might also be a blicket since the light turned on when both were on the machine.
