When object 2 was on the machine with object 0, the light was off, but when object 2 was on the machine with object 1, the light turned on. This suggests that object 2 is necessary for the machine to turn on, and object 1 might also be a blicket since the light turned on when both were on the machine together.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test object 2 with other objects to see if the light turns on, and also test object 1 alone to see if it can turn on the machine without object 2. However, since I have already tested object 1 alone and it did not turn on the machine, it seems likely that object 1 is not a blicket on its own.\n\nThe potential issue is that I haven't tested all combinations, but given the constraints, I should focus on confirming object 2's role as a blicket.

When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n3. After removing object 2, the light turned off, confirming that object 2 is necessary to turn the machine on.\n4. When object 4 was placed on the machine with object 2, the light turned on. However, since object 2 was already identified as a blicket, the presence of object 4 does not provide new information about its status as a blicket.\n\nThe key observation is that object 2 alone can turn the machine on, and the addition of object 4 does not change the state of the machine when object 2 is already present. Therefore, object 4 is not necessary to turn the machine on, and there is no evidence to suggest that object 4 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
