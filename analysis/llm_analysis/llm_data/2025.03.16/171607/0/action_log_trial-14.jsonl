Removing object 5 while object 1 was on the machine kept the light on, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n4. Placing object 1 on the machine consistently turned the light on, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n5. Placing objects 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 on the machine without object 1 did not turn the light on, suggesting these objects are not blickets.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that object 1 is the only blicket, as it is the only object that consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.
