However, object 5 seems to have an effect when combined with object 1, as the machine remains on when both are present, but turns off when object 1 is removed. This suggests that object 5 might also be a blicket, but it requires object 1 to activate the machine.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that object 1 must be present. Object 5 might also be a blicket, but it does not independently turn the machine on without object 1.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test object 5 again without object 1 to see if it can turn the machine on independently. If it cannot, then object 1 is the primary blicket, and object 5 is a secondary blicket that requires object 1 to function.\n\n> put object 5 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 0 was on the machine alone, the light was off.\n2. When object 1 was added, the light turned on.\n3. Adding objects 2, 3, and 4 did not change the light status when object 1 was on the machine.\n4. Removing objects 2, 3, and 4 did not turn the light off as long as object 1 was on the machine.\n5. Removing object 1 turned the light off, even if other objects were on the machine.\n6. When object 5 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on.\n7. Removing object 5 turned the light off, unless object 1 was also on the machine.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 1 and object 5 can independently turn the machine on.
