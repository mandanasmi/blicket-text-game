Placing objects 0 and 2 on the machine did not turn the light on, suggesting they are not blickets.\n3. Placing object 3 on the machine turned the light on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n4. Placing object 4 on the machine while object 3 was on kept the light on. Removing object 3 while object 4 was on kept the light on, suggesting object 4 is also a blicket.\n5. Placing object 5 on the machine while object 4 was on kept the light on. Removing object 4 while object 5 was on turned the light off, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that objects 1, 3, and 4 are blickets.

Object 5: The machine does not turn on when this object is on it alone, but it does when combined with other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that objects 1, 3, and 4 are likely blickets because they consistently turn the machine on when placed on it. Object 5 might not be a blicket since it doesn't turn the machine on by itself. Objects 0 and 2 do not turn the machine on, so they are likely not blickets.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be on the machine for it to turn on. \n\nTo confirm this, I will test object 5 again by itself to see if it can turn the machine on without any other objects. If it doesn't, it will further confirm that object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
