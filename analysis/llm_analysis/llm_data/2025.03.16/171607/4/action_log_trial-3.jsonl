Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Reflecting on the information gathered:\n\n1. Initially, when object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, suggesting object 1 might be a blicket.\n3. Adding objects 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the machine did not turn the light off, indicating they might also be blickets.\n4. Removing objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 did not turn the light off, suggesting that none of these objects are solely responsible for keeping the light on.\n5. Removing object 5 turned the light off, indicating that object 5 is necessary to keep the light on.\n\nFrom this, it can be inferred that object 5 is indeed a blicket, as its presence is required for the machine to turn on. The rule seems to be that object 5 is a blicket, and possibly other objects might be blickets too, but object 5 is definitely one.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
