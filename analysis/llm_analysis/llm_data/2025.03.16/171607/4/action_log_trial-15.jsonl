When removed, the light turns off if no other object is on the machine.\n2. **Object 4**: When placed on the machine with object 1, the light stays on. However, when object 4 is removed, the light turns off if no other object is on the machine.\n3. **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off if no other object is on the machine.\n4. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light does not turn on.\n5. **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off if no other object is on the machine.\n6. **Object 5**: When placed on the machine, the light does not turn on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that objects 1, 0, and 3 are blickets because they can independently turn the machine on. Objects 2 and 5 do not turn the machine on, so they are not blickets. Object 4 seems to be a blicket because it can keep the machine on when combined with other blickets, but it does not independently turn the machine on.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that at least one blicket must be on the machine for the light to turn on.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test object 4 independently to see if it can turn the machine on by itself.
