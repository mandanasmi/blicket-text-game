Object 2, object 3, and object 5 can individually turn the machine on when placed on it.\n2. Object 0, object 1, and object 4 do not turn the machine on when placed individually.\n3. The machine turns off when object 3 or object 5 is removed, but not when object 2 is removed if object 3 or object 5 is still on the machine.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that objects 2, 3, and 5 are blickets, as they can independently turn the machine on. Objects 0, 1, and 4 are not blickets, as they do not affect the machine's state when placed on it.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that at least one blicket must be on the machine for it to turn on. \n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test object 4 again, as it was the only object that seemed to have an ambiguous result when combined with other objects.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n2. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n3. When object 4 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n4. When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n\nAdditionally, the machine turned on with combinations of objects that included object 5, and when object 5 was removed, the light turned off if no other blicket was present.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 5 is likely a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
