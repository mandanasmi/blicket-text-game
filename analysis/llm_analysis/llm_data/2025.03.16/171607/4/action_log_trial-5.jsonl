Placing object 4 back on turned the light on again.\n4. Placing objects 0, 2, 3, and 5 on the machine did not affect the light when object 4 was on the machine.\n5. Removing object 4 turned the light off, even when other objects were on the machine.\n6. Placing object 1 back on the machine with object 4 off did not turn the light on.\n7. Removing object 5 turned the light off when it was the only object on the machine.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 4 is a blicket, as it consistently turns the machine on when placed on it. Object 5 might also be a blicket, as the light was on when it was on the machine alone, but further testing is needed to confirm this.\n\nThe rule appears to be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. \n\nTo confirm object 5's status, I will place it back on the machine to see if the light turns on.\n\n> put object 5 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, objects 1 and 4 were on the machine, and the light was on.\n2. Removing object 1 kept the light on, indicating object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n3. Removing object 4 turned the light off, indicating object 4 is a blicket.\n4. Placing object 4 back on turned the light on, confirming object 4 is a blicket.\n5. Placing object 0 on the machine with object 4 kept the light on, but removing object 0 did not turn the light off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n6. Placing object 2 on the machine with object 4 kept the light on, but removing object 2 did not turn the light off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n7. Placing object 3 on the machine with object 4 kept the light on, but removing object 3 did not turn the light off, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n8. Placing object 5 on the machine with object 4 kept the light on, but removing object 5 turned the light off, indicating object 5 is a blicket.\n9. Placing object 5 on the machine alone turned the light on, confirming object 5 is a blicket.\n\nThe key observations are:\n- The light turns on with object 4 alone, confirming it is a blicket.\n- The light turns on with object 5 alone, confirming it is a blicket.\n- The light turns off when object 5 is removed, indicating it is necessary for the light to be on when object 4 is not present.\n\nTherefore, object 5 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
