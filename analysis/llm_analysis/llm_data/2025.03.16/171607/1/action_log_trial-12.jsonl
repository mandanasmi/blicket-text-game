However, there is an interesting observation with object 0. Initially, when object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light did not turn on. But later, when object 0 was placed on the machine after object 4 was removed, the light turned on. This suggests that object 0 might also be a blicket, but it requires a specific condition or sequence to activate the machine.\n\nThe current hypothesis is that object 4 is a blicket that can independently turn on the machine, while object 0 might be a blicket that requires a specific sequence or combination to activate the machine. The other objects (1, 2, 3, 5) do not seem to have any effect on the machine, as they have been tested individually and in combination with object 4 without turning the machine on.\n\nTo further test this hypothesis, I will try placing object 0 on the machine again to see if it consistently turns the machine on, confirming its status as a blicket.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
