This suggests that object 2 is a blicket. Object 4 also seems to be a blicket, as it was involved in turning the machine on in a previous test. \n\nThe rule might be that at least one of these objects (object 2 or object 4) needs to be on the machine for it to turn on. However, I need to confirm this by testing object 4 alone again, as the previous test with object 4 alone did not turn the machine on, which might have been due to an error in my testing sequence.\n\nTo confirm, I will place object 4 on the machine alone to see if it turns on.
