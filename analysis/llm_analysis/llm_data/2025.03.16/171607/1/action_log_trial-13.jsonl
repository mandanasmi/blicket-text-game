You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 5 was added to the machine, the light turned on.\n3. Removing object 4 turned the light off, even though object 5 was still on the machine.\n4. When object 5 was placed on the machine alone, the light remained off.\n5. When object 4 was placed on the machine with object 5, the light turned on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 5 alone does not turn the machine on. The machine only turns on when both object 4 and object 5 are on it together. This suggests that object 5 is not a blicket on its own, but it may be part of a combination that activates the machine.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, object 5 is not a blicket by itself.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
