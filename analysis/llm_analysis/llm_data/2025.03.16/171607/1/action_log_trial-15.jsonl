This suggests that object 2 is a blicket. The machine turned on when object 2 was placed on it, even when other objects were also on the machine. \n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that object 2 must be on the machine. No other object seems to affect the machine's state, as the machine remains off when any combination of objects other than object 2 is on it.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test object 2 alone on the machine again to ensure it turns on, and then test it with another object to see if the machine still turns on.
