This suggests that the rule for the machine to turn on might require both objects 4 and 5 to be present.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test placing both objects 4 and 5 on the machine together again to see if the light turns on. If it does, it would confirm that both objects are blickets and that the rule involves having both of them on the machine simultaneously.\n\nPotential issues in my previous approach include not systematically testing combinations of objects and not clearly identifying the conditions under which the machine turns on.
