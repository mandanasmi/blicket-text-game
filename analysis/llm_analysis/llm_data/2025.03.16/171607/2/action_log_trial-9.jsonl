Initially, when object 5 was placed on the machine with objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, the machine turned on. However, when object 5 was placed alone, the machine did not turn on. This suggests that object 5 is a necessary component for the machine to turn on, but it is not sufficient by itself.\n\nTo further investigate, I need to determine which combination of objects with object 5 causes the machine to turn on. I will try adding objects one by one with object 5 to see if the machine turns on. Since object 5 is already on the machine, I will start by adding object 4, as it was the last object added before the machine turned on initially.\n\nPotential issues include not having enough steps to test all combinations, but I will try to be efficient by testing combinations that seem most likely based on previous results.\n\n> put object 4 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
