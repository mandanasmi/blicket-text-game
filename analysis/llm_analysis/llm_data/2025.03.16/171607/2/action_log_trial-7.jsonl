Initially, objects 0 and 5 were on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. Removing object 5 did not change the light status (it remained off).\n3. Placing object 5 back on the machine did not turn the light on.\n4. The light turned on when object 3 was placed on the machine, and it turned off when object 3 was removed.\n5. The light also turned on when object 1 was placed on the machine with object 3, and it turned off when object 1 was removed.\n6. Object 5 was never involved in any scenario where the light turned on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 5 does not affect the machine's light status. The light only turned on with the presence of objects 1 and 3, suggesting they are the blickets. Object 5 does not appear to have any effect on the machine, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the information and reasoning, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
