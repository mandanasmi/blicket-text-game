Initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine with object 0, the light turned on.\n3. Removing object 0 turned the light off, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n4. Placing object 1 alone on the machine did not turn the light on, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n5. Objects 2, 3, 4, and 5 were placed on the machine individually, and the light remained off, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\nThe key observation is that the light only turned on when object 0 was on the machine, either alone or with other objects. Object 5, when placed on the machine, did not turn the light on, either alone or in combination with other objects.\n\nTherefore, object 5 does not affect the state of the machine and is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
