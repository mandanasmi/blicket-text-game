You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 6 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on top of the machine, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor, object 4 is on the floor, object 5 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Reflecting on the information gathered:\n\n1. Initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. When object 0 was removed, the light remained off. This suggests that object 0 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n2. When objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were placed on the machine one by one, the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n\n3. When object 0 was placed on the machine again, the light turned on. This indicates that object 0 is necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\n4. When object 0 was removed, the light turned off, confirming that object 0 is necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n5. When object 0 was placed on the machine with object 1, the light remained on, but removing object 0 turned the light off again. This further confirms that object 0 is the key object for turning the machine on.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 0 is the only object that can turn the machine on, and the presence of other objects does not affect the machine's state. Therefore, object 5 does not have any effect on the machine's state and is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
