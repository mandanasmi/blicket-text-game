To confirm this, I should test if the machine turns on with object 3 alone, without any other objects. This will help verify that object 3 is indeed the only blicket and that no other objects are required for the machine to turn on.\n\nPotential issues: \n- I have not tested all combinations of objects, but given the current evidence, object 3 seems to be the only one affecting the machine. \n- I should ensure that no other objects are on the machine when testing object 3 alone to avoid any confounding effects.\n\nNext step: Place only object 3 on the machine to confirm it is the sole blicket.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
