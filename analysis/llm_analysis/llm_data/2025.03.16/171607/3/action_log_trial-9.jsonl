Objects 1, 2, and 5 do not turn the machine on when placed alone, so they are not blickets.\n\nThe rule seems to be that any single blicket can turn the machine on by itself. There doesn't appear to be a need for combinations of objects to turn the machine on, as each blicket works independently.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test one more scenario by placing object 2 on the machine, as it has not been tested in combination with other objects that are known to be blickets.\n\n> put object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
