After removing object 1, the light stayed on with objects 2 and 3 on the machine. This suggests that either object 2 or object 3 is a blicket.\n6. After removing object 2, the light stayed on with object 3 on the machine. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n7. When object 4 was placed on the machine, the light stayed on (since object 3 was already on). This doesn't provide new information about object 4.\n8. After removing object 3, the light turned off with object 4 on the machine. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n9. When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n10. After removing object 4, the light stayed on with object 5 on the machine. This confirms object 5 is a blicket.\n11.
