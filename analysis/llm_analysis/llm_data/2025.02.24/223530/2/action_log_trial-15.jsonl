This suggests that Object 3 does not have a strong correlation with being a blicket.\n\nGiven that Object 3 has not been confirmed as a blicket and the tests indicate it is likely not, we conclude that Object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 2901, "total_tokens": 3139}}
