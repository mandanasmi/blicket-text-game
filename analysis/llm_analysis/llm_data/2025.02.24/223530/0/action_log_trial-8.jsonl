All other objects did not activate the machine's light when placed on it. This suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket, as it is the only object that has consistently shown the ability to turn on the machine.\n\nAdditionally, the independence test results indicate a strong relationship between object 3 and the machine, with a high chi2 statistic and a low p-value, further supporting the conclusion that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 2845, "total_tokens": 3075}}
