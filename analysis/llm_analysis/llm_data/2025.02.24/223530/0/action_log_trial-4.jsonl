Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, the light on the machine only turned on when object 0 was placed on it. Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, but the light remained off. This suggests that object 3 does not activate the machine. The independence test results also show a strong relationship between object 0 and the machine, while object 3 does not show a significant relationship with the machine. Therefore, it can be concluded that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 2841, "total_tokens": 3059}}
