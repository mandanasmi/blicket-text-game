Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, and the light turned on only when it was present. However, when it was taken off, the light turned off. This suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket. \n\nAdditionally, the independence test results show a strong relationship between object 3 and the machine, indicated by a high chi2 statistic and a low p-value. This further supports the conclusion that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 2839, "total_tokens": 3063}}
