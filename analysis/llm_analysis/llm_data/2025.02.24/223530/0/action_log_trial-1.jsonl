The light was off when other objects were placed on the machine, indicating that object 3 is likely a blicket. The independence test results also show a strong relationship between object 3 and the machine, with a high chi2 statistic and a very low p-value, suggesting that the presence of object 3 significantly affects the machine's state.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 286, "prompt_tokens": 2843, "total_tokens": 3129}}
