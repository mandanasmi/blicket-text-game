All other objects (1, 2, and 3) did not activate the machine's light when placed on it. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket, while the others are not.\n\nThe independence test results show strong relationships between the objects and the machine, particularly between object 3 and the machine, but since object 3 did not activate the machine's light in any of the tests, it indicates that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer to whether object 3 is a blicket is:\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 2841, "total_tokens": 3006}}
