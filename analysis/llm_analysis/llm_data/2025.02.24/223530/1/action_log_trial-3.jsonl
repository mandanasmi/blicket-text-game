This suggests that object 3 may be a blicket, as it contributed to the machine being on. However, since the light also turned on with object 0 alone, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket without further testing.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 2893, "total_tokens": 3182}}
