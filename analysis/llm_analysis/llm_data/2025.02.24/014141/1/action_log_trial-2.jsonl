There is no evidence that object 3 is a blicket, as it was never tested individually, and the light did not turn on when it was placed on the machine with other objects.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": false, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 95, "prompt_tokens": 1238, "total_tokens": 1333}}
