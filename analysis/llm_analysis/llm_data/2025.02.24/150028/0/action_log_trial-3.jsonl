Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, but the light remained off each time. This indicates that object 3 does not activate the machine. Additionally, the independence tests show a significant relationship between object 3 and the machine, suggesting that object 3 does not contribute to the machine being on. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 2769, "total_tokens": 3015}}
