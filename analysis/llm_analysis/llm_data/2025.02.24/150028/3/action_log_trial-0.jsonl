However, when object 2 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 2 is a blicket. Object 3 was also able to turn the light on when placed on the machine, but it was never tested alone without object 2. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket since it could be dependent on object 2.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 267, "prompt_tokens": 2769, "total_tokens": 3036}}
