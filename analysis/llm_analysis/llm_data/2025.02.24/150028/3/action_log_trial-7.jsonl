However, it was also observed that the light turned on with object 3 on the machine. Since the light was off when only object 1 was on the machine, it suggests that object 1 is not a blicket. \n\nSince both object 2 and object 3 can turn the light on, and object 1 does not contribute to turning the light on, it is likely that both object 2 and object 3 are blickets. Therefore, object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 234, "prompt_tokens": 2769, "total_tokens": 3003}}
