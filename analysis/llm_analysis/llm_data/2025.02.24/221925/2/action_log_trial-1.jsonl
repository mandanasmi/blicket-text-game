Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, object 2 is confirmed to be a blicket since it turned the machine on when placed on it. Object 3 is likely a blicket, as it consistently turned the machine on when placed on it, but it has not been definitively tested alone without object 2. The independence tests show strong relationships between the objects and the machine, particularly between object 2 and the machine, and between object 3 and the machine. However, since object 3 has not been tested alone without the presence of object 2, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 3057, "total_tokens": 3261}}
