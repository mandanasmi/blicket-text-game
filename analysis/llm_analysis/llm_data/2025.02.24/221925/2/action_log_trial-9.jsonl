Object 3 is still in a state of uncertainty; it has been on the machine multiple times with the light remaining on, but it has not been tested alone without object 2. The consistent presence of the light when object 3 is on the machine suggests it may be a blicket, but it has not been definitively proven as such. \n\nGiven the independence tests, the strong correlation between object 2 and object 3 indicates that object 3 may also be a blicket, but without further testing, we cannot confirm it definitively.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 3120, "total_tokens": 3338}}
