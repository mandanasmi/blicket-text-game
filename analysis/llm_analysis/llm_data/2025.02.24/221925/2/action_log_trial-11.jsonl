You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'.

Object 3 has been inconsistent; it has turned the machine on when placed on it, but it also turned the machine off when removed, suggesting it may not be a blicket. The independence tests show a strong relationship between object 2 and object 3, indicating that object 3's status may depend on the presence of object 2. Given that object 3 has not consistently activated the machine on its own, it is reasonable to conclude that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 3060, "total_tokens": 3363}}
