Do not use multiple spellings to describe the same attribute.\n- Be accurate and concise in your description.\n\nIn addition to the item-attribute set, you will also be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n\nReply concisely and exactly with the requested format.", "prompt": "Interact with the environment to find the blickets and discover the rule.\nYou are in a room.

The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.

Valid commands are: 'put <object> on [the] machine', 'put <object> on [the] floor', 'take <object> off [of] [the] machine', 'look', or 'exit'.
