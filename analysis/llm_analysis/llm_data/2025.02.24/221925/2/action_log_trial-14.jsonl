Object 0 and object 1 are confirmed not to be blickets as they did not activate the machine. Object 3 is still uncertain; it has been described as \"likely a blicket\" but has not been definitively tested alone to confirm its status. The independence tests show strong relationships between the objects and the machine, particularly between object 2 and the machine, but do not provide conclusive evidence for object 3 being a blicket.\n\nGiven that object 3 has not been definitively tested alone and its status remains uncertain, I conclude that object 3 is not confirmed as a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 3062, "total_tokens": 3298}}
