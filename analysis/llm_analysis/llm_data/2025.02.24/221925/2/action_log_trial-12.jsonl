The relationship between object 3 and the machine is also significant, but since we have not isolated object 3 to test it alone without the influence of object 2, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket.\n\nThus, the answer to whether object 3 is a blicket is uncertain based on the current evidence.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 3565, "total_tokens": 3751}}
