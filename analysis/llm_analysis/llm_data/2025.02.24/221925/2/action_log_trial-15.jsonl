Object 3 has shown a consistent ability to turn the machine on when placed on it, but it has not been definitively tested alone without object 2. The repeated tests with object 3 on the machine indicate it likely behaves similarly to object 2, but without a definitive test to isolate its effect, we cannot confirm it as a blicket with certainty.\n\nGiven the information, I conclude that object 3 is likely a blicket, but I cannot confirm it definitively based on the tests conducted.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 2970, "total_tokens": 3228}}
