Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, object 2 is confirmed to be a blicket since it turned the machine on when placed on it. Object 3 has been consistently associated with the machine being on, but it has not been tested alone to confirm its status. The independence tests show strong relationships between the objects and the machine, particularly between object 2 and object 3, suggesting that object 3 may also be a blicket. However, without direct confirmation from testing object 3 alone, we cannot definitively conclude its status.\n\nGiven the evidence, I will conclude that object 3 is likely a blicket, but it has not been confirmed.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 3030, "total_tokens": 3276}}
