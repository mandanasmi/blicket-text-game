Object 3 has been consistently associated with the machine being on, but it has not been definitively tested alone without object 2. The independence tests show a strong relationship between object 2 and object 3, suggesting that object 3 may also be a blicket, but it has not been confirmed independently. Therefore, I cannot definitively conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 259, "prompt_tokens": 3150, "total_tokens": 3409}}
