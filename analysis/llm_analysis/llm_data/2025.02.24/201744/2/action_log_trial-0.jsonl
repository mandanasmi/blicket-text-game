Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, we have established that when object 2 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. Additionally, when object 1 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on. Object 3 was observed to keep the light on when placed on the machine, but we have not seen it alone to determine its effect independently.\n\nThe independence test results show a significant relationship between object 1 and object 3, indicating that they may both contribute to the machine's light being on. However, since we have not tested object 3 alone, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket based solely on the current observations.\n\nThus, we cannot confirm that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 265, "prompt_tokens": 2770, "total_tokens": 3035}}
