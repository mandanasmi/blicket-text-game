Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response": "Based on the observations, object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, and each time the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 is likely a blicket. Additionally, the independence tests show a strong relationship between object 3 and the machine, indicated by a significant chi2 statistic and a low p-value. This further supports the conclusion that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 2770, "total_tokens": 3013}}
