A subset of the objects are 'blickets', which turn on the light on the machine following some rule. \nYour goal is to explore the relationship between the objects and the machines to determine which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.\nAfter the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\n\nFor each observation, come up with an item-attribute set which you think is relevant.\n- Format it as json, e.g. {\"item 1\": \"attribute a\", \"item 2\": \"attribute b\", \"item 3\", \"attribute a\", ...}.\n- The items should be unique, but the attributes can be re-used.\n- Come up with a set of item names by looking at the full history of past observations\n- Include any and all item names that you think may be potentially relevant and related to the goal, including the goal itself.\n- You can also include items that are currently un-observed but relevant for achieving the goal.\n- Come up with a set of attribute names by looking at the full history of past observations and actions, including if past observations indicate that items' attributes have changed.\n- Try to keep each attribute short. Do not use multiple spellings to describe the same attribute.\n- Be accurate and concise in your description.\n\nReply concisely and exactly with the requested format.", "prompt": "You are in a room.
