However, when it is removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket. \n\nAdditionally, the independence test results show a strong correlation between object 3 and the machine, with a significant chi2 statistic and a low p-value, further supporting the conclusion that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 255, "prompt_tokens": 2767, "total_tokens": 3022}}
