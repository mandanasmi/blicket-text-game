When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light also turned on, suggesting that object 2 could also be a blicket. However, when object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating that object 0 is not a blicket. \n\nThe independence tests show strong relationships between the objects and the machine, particularly between object 2 and the machine, which suggests that object 2 is likely a blicket. \n\nGiven that the light turned on with object 2 on the machine, and considering the independence tests that indicate a significant relationship between object 2 and the machine, I conclude that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": true, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 2771, "total_tokens": 3008}}
