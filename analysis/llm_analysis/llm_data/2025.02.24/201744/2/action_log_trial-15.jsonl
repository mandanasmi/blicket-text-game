Specifically, object 2 and object 3 have consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine. Object 1 has also turned the light on, but it was not as consistently tested as the others. \n\nThe independence tests show that there is a strong relationship between the objects and the machine, particularly with object 2 and object 3. The chi-squared statistics for the pairs involving object 3 and the machine indicate a significant relationship, but the p-values for the relationship between object 3 and being a blicket are high, suggesting that object 3 may not be a blicket.\n\nGiven that object 3 has not been tested independently enough to confirm it as a blicket, and considering the independence test results, it is reasonable to conclude that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 2772, "total_tokens": 3017}}
