Since I have not been able to successfully take any object off the machine or put any object on the machine without the light remaining on, it suggests that the machine is not responding to the specific objects in a way that indicates any of them are blickets. Therefore, I cannot conclude that object 5 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": false, "true_answer": true, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 1582, "total_tokens": 1694}}
