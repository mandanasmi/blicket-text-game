This suggests that object 7 does not have a unique effect on the machine's state. The light's state seems independent of object 7, indicating that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 391, "prompt_tokens": 1291, "total_tokens": 1682}, "estimated_cost": 0.007137500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-37.jsonl"}
