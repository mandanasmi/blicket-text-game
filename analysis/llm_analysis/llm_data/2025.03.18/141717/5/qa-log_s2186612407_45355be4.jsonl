The machine's state does not change when object 7 is added or removed, suggesting that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket because its presence or absence does not affect the state of the machine.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 626, "prompt_tokens": 1289, "total_tokens": 1915}, "estimated_cost": 0.0094825, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
