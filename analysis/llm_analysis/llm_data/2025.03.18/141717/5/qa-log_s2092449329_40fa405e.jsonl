This suggests that neither object 2 nor object 6 alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Interactions Involving Object 6:**\n   - When object 6 is taken off the machine (while object 2 is still on it), the light remains on. This suggests that object 6 is not necessary to keep the light on when object 2 is present.\n   - When object 6 is put back on the machine (after object 2 is removed), the light remains off. This suggests that object 6 alone does not turn the machine on.\n   - When object 6 is on the machine with other objects (like objects 1, 5, 3, 7, 0, 4), the light remains off. This further suggests that object 6 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on when object 2 is on it, regardless of the presence of object 6. When object 6 is on the machine without object 2, the light is off.\n   - Therefore, object 6 does not have any effect on the machine's state and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 1293, "total_tokens": 1609}, "estimated_cost": 0.0063925, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
