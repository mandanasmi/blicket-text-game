The light only turns on with object 1, and object 7 does not affect the light when object 1 is not present.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 527, "prompt_tokens": 1291, "total_tokens": 1818}, "estimated_cost": 0.008497500000000002, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-35.jsonl"}
