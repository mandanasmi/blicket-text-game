The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 7 off the machine\nYou took object 7 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 2 off the machine\nYou took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 6 off the machine\nYou took object 6 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 1 off the machine\nYou took object 1 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n\nBased on the information above, is object 7 a blicket?\n\nPlease provide a detailed chain-of-thought explaining your reasoning, and then output the final answer in the format '> True/False'.
