This suggests that object 4 might be a non-blicket, but it doesn't affect the status of object 1 as a blicket.\n\n5. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine along with other objects (3, 5, 0, 4, 2), and the machine remained off.\n   - Object 7 was removed from the machine, and the machine remained off.\n   - Object 7 was never tested in combination with object 1, which is known to be a blicket.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 7 alone or in combination with other non-blicket objects did not turn the machine on, and it was not tested with object 1, we have no evidence that object 7 is a blicket.\n   - The only object that consistently turned the machine on was object 1, indicating it is the only confirmed blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 1291, "total_tokens": 1701}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073275, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-37.jsonl"}
