This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 4 is placed on the machine, the light remains on, suggesting object 4 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 7 while the light is on (with other objects) does not affect the light, indicating object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - After removing objects 3 and 4, the light turns off, reinforcing that these objects are necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Placing object 7 back on the machine does not turn the light on, confirming that object 7 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns on with object 3 alone, and stays on with object 4. Removing object 4 turns the light off, indicating object 4 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 7, when placed on the machine without objects 3 or 4, does not turn the light on, indicating it does not have the property of a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not influence the state of the machine's light and is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 349, "prompt_tokens": 1291, "total_tokens": 1640}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067175, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-11.jsonl"}
