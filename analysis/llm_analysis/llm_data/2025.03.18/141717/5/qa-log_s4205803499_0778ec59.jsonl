This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light remains on, reinforcing that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 6 is put back on, and the light remains off.\n   - Objects 4, 2, 5, 7, 1 are removed, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 0 is put back on, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 3 is put back on, and the light remains off, indicating object 3 alone is not sufficient to turn the light on.\n\n3. **Critical Test:**\n   - Objects 2, 7, 1, 4 are put on the machine, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 5 is added, and the light turns on. This suggests object 5 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 6 is added, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 4 is removed, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light remains off, confirming object 5 is a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The light turns on with object 3 and object 5, indicating they are blickets.\n- Object 7 was on the machine when the light was off and was removed when the light was on, showing no effect on the machine's state.\n- Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 509, "prompt_tokens": 1293, "total_tokens": 1802}, "estimated_cost": 0.0083225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-7.jsonl"}
