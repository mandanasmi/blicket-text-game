This suggests that object 0 is a blicket, and possibly objects 4, 5, and 2.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - Removing object 7 while the light is on (with objects 0, 4, 5, 2 on the machine) does not turn the light off. This suggests object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing objects 0, 4, 5, and 2 in various combinations turns the light off, confirming these objects are likely blickets.\n\n4. **Re-adding Objects**:\n   - Re-adding objects 6, 3, 2, 0, 5, 4, and 1 in various combinations shows that the light turns on when object 1 is added, suggesting object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 7 again while the light is on does not affect the light, reinforcing that object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n5. **Final Observations**:\n   - The light is off when only objects 6 and 7 are on the machine, indicating neither object 6 nor 7 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns on and off independently of object 7's presence, suggesting object 7 does not influence the machine's state.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket, as its presence or absence does not correlate with the machine's light being on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 430, "prompt_tokens": 1293, "total_tokens": 1723}, "estimated_cost": 0.0075325, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
