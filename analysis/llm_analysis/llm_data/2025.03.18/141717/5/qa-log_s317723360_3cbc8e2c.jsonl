This indicates that object 7 does not affect the machine's state.\n   - Since a blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine, and object 7 does not influence the machine's state, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the definition of a blicket, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 360, "prompt_tokens": 1293, "total_tokens": 1653}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068325, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
