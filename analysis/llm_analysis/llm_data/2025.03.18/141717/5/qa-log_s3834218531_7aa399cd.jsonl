This suggests object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light remains on. Object 7 is removed, and the light stays on. Object 5 is removed, and the light stays on. Object 1 is added, and the light stays on.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is added, and the light remains off. Object 1 is removed, and the light remains off. Object 5 is added, and the light remains off. Object 0 is removed, and the light remains off. Object 3 is removed, and the light remains off.

Object 3 is added, and the light stays on. This suggests object 3 does not affect the light when it is already on.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light stays on. Object 1 is added, and the light stays on. Object 7 is removed, and the light stays on. Object 7 is added back, and the light stays on.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains off.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYou will be given a history of another agent's interactions within the same game, where the agent's action is indicated with '>'. The objects and the machine that you're given are the same as the ones given to that agent. You will then be asked a True/False question. You should answer the question to the best of your ability based on the given history of interaction.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Infer from the interactions which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on.\n- Do the above in order to answer the question correctly.\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n", "user_prompt": "You are in a room.
