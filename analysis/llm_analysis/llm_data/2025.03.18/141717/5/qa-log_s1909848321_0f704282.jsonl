This suggests object 4 is a blicket.\n   - After object 4 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off until object 4 is also placed, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light remains off, indicating object 7 does not affect the light.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - In subsequent tests, placing object 7 on the machine does not turn the light on.\n   - Removing object 7 when the light is on (due to other objects) does not affect the light, indicating object 7 does not contribute to the light being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 7 does not independently cause the machine's light to turn on.\n   - The light's state is unaffected by the presence or absence of object 7, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 1291, "total_tokens": 1629}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066075000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}
