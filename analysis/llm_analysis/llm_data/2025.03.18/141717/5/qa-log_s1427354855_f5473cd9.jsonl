This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 5, 3, and 1 while object 2 is on the machine keeps the light on, indicating these objects do not affect the light when object 2 is present.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding objects 0, 3, and 7 with object 2 does not turn the light on, suggesting these objects are not blickets.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Removing object 6 while object 2 is on the machine turns the light off, indicating object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 2 alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 2 needs another object to activate the machine.\n   - Adding object 6 with object 2 turns the light on, suggesting a combination rule where both objects are needed to activate the machine.\n\n4. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 was added to the machine multiple times, both with and without object 2, and the light never turned on.\n   - Removing object 7 when the light was off did not change the state of the machine.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not seem to affect the state of the machine, either alone or in combination with other objects. Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 441, "prompt_tokens": 1293, "total_tokens": 1734}, "estimated_cost": 0.0076425, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}
