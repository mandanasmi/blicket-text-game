This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 0 and 3 are added, and the machine remains on. This suggests they might also be blickets, but we need more evidence.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the machine stays on, indicating object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the machine stays on, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the machine turns off, confirming object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 6, 7, 4, 3, 0, and 1 are removed, and the machine remains off, providing no new information about object 7.\n\n3. **Second Round of Testing:**\n   - Objects 3, 4, 1, 7, and 0 are placed on the machine, and it remains off.\n   - Object 5 is added, and the machine turns on, reinforcing that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the machine stays on, confirming object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is added, and the machine stays on, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Objects 3, 7, and 1 are removed, and the machine turns off when object 1 is removed, suggesting object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the machine turns off, confirming object 5 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Throughout the interactions, object 7 is placed on the machine multiple times, but the machine never turns on solely due to object 7.\n   - The machine turns on with object 5 and possibly object 1, but not with object 7.\n   - Therefore, object 7 does not appear to influence the state of the machine and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 529, "prompt_tokens": 1292, "total_tokens": 1821}, "estimated_cost": 0.00852, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/7/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
