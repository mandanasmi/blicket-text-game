This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Adding objects 0 and 1 kept the light on, suggesting they might also be blickets.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing objects 2, 6, 3, 7, 1, and 4 did not turn the light off, indicating they might not be necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turned the light off, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Second Round of Testing:**\n   - Objects 7, 6, 1, and 5 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off.\n   - Adding object 0 turned the light on, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 kept the light on, suggesting object 3 is also a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Removals:**\n   - Removing objects 4, 3, and 7 did not turn the light off, indicating they are not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turned the light off again, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine multiple times without turning the light on.\n   - The light remained on when object 7 was removed, indicating it is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 399, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1647}, "estimated_cost": 0.00711, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-49.jsonl"}
