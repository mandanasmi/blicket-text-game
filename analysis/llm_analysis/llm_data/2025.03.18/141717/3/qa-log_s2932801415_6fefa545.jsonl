This suggests object 5 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Adding Objects**: \n   - Adding objects 6, 3, 7, 0, 2, 4, and 1 to the machine did not turn the light off, indicating that none of these objects alone are responsible for turning the light on.\n   - When object 5 was removed, the light stayed on, suggesting that object 5 is not the sole blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - After removing object 5, the light stayed on until object 0 was removed, at which point the light turned off. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on again, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 6, 4, 7, 3, 2, and 1 did not affect the light when object 0 was on the machine, indicating these objects are not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Final Analysis**:\n   - The light turned off when object 0 was removed, regardless of the presence of other objects, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was on the machine when the light was on, but the light turned off when object 0 was removed, indicating object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket because the light's state was dependent on object 0, not object 7.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1620}, "estimated_cost": 0.006817500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-23.jsonl"}
