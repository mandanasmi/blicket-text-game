This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 1, 4, and 3 are added, and the light remains on. This doesn't provide information about these objects since the light was already on.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light stays on, indicating object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light stays on, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light stays on, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 7, 1, 4, and 2 are removed, and the light remains off, providing no new information about these objects.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Objects 2, 4, 1, and 5 are placed on the machine, and the light remains off, suggesting none of these are blickets.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light remains off, confirming object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on, confirming again that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light remains on, providing no new information about object 3.\n   - Object 7 is added, and the light remains on, providing no new information about object 7.\n   - Objects 4, 3, 0, and 7 are removed, and the light turns off after object 0 is removed, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was off, and it did not turn on. This suggests object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - The light only turns on when object 0 is on the machine, indicating that object 0 is the only confirmed blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket because it was placed on the machine when the light was off, and it did not cause the light to turn on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 566, "prompt_tokens": 1239, "total_tokens": 1805}, "estimated_cost": 0.008757500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-9.jsonl"}
