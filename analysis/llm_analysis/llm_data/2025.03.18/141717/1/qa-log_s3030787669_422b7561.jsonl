This suggests that object 7 alone is not a blicket.\n   - When object 5 was added, the light turned on. This indicates that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - After placing all objects on the machine, the light was on. When object 5 was removed, the light stayed on, but when object 3 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 3 is also a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 7, 6, 0, 4, 2, and 1 did not affect the light when object 3 was on the machine, indicating these objects are not necessary to keep the light on.\n\n3. **Re-testing:**\n   - When object 3 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turned the light off, further confirming its status as a blicket.\n   - Removing object 5 turned the light off, confirming object 5 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine multiple times, but it never caused the light to turn on by itself, nor did it keep the light on when other objects were removed.\n   - The light turned off when object 5 or object 3 was removed, but not when object 7 was removed, indicating object 7 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 371, "prompt_tokens": 1237, "total_tokens": 1608}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
