Ensure only one answer is included.", "question_obj_idx": 7, "question_obj_name": "object 7", "response_msg": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions and the state of the machine's light.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Object 1 is on the machine, and the light is on.\n\n2. **Adding Object 5:**\n   - Object 5 is added, and the light remains on. This suggests object 5 might be a blicket, but it could also be that object 1 is the blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Object 1:**\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light turns off. This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Adding Objects 4, 7, 6, 0, 2:**\n   - Each of these objects is added one by one, and the light remains off. This suggests none of these objects are blickets.\n\n5. **Adding Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light turns on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n\n6. **Removing Objects 6, 0, 7:**\n   - These objects are removed, and the light remains on. This further supports that these objects are not blickets.\n\n7. **Removing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n\n8. **Adding Object 1:**\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light turns on. This confirms object 1 is a blicket.\n\n9. **Adding Objects 2, 3, 6, 5, 7:**\n   - The light remains on with these additions. Since object 1 is already on the machine, the light being on doesn't provide new information about these objects.\n\n10. **Removing Object 1:**\n    - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests that at least one of the other objects (2, 3, 6, 5, 7) is a blicket.\n\n11. **Removing Objects 4, 0, 7, 5, 3, 6:**\n    - The light remains on until object 3 is removed, at which point the light turns off. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n\n12. **Final Test with Object 1:**\n    - Object 1 is added again, and the light turns on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n\nThroughout these interactions, object 7 was added and removed multiple times without affecting the light when object 1 or 3 was not on the machine. This strongly suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 560, "prompt_tokens": 1239, "total_tokens": 1799}, "estimated_cost": 0.0086975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-22.jsonl"}
