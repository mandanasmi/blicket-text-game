This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Objects 5, 7, 2, 1, and 4 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on.\n   - Objects 3 and 0 were added, and the light stayed on.\n   - Removing object 6 turned the light off, confirming object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 also turned the light off, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 6 is on the machine, either alone or with other objects.\n   - Object 0 also seems to be a blicket since its removal turned the light off when it was on with object 6.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, and the light never turned on or stayed on because of it.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket, as it never caused the machine to turn on or contributed to keeping it on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 1237, "total_tokens": 1640}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-55.jsonl"}
