This suggests that these objects either do not affect the light or are not necessary for it to be on.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Objects 1 and 3 are removed, and the light remains on until object 3 is removed. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n4. **Re-adding Objects:**\n   - Object 3 is put back on, and the light turns on. This further supports that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Testing Other Objects:**\n   - Objects 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are manipulated, and the light's behavior is observed:\n     - When object 4 is added, the light turns on, suggesting object 4 might be a blicket.\n     - Removing object 4 turns the light off, confirming object 4 is a blicket.\n     - Object 5 is added, and the light turns on, but removing object 5 turns the light off, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n     - Object 3 is added again, and the light turns on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n6. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 is added and removed multiple times, but the light's state does not change based on its presence or absence.\n   - The light remains on or off due to the presence of other objects (like 3 and 4), not object 7.\n\nFrom this analysis, object 7 does not appear to affect the light's state, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 425, "prompt_tokens": 1242, "total_tokens": 1667}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073549999999999996, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
