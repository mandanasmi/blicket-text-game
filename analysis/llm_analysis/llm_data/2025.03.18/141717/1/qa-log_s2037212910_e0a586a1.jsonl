This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Objects 0 and 1 were added, and the light stayed on. This suggests they might also be blickets.\n   - Object 4 was initially on the machine, and the light was off. When it was removed, the light stayed on, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was added, and the light stayed on, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 turned the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 6 also turned the light off, confirming object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 5, 3, 7, 0, and 1 did not turn the light off, suggesting they are not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Re-adding Objects:**\n   - Re-adding object 2 turned the light back on, confirming its status as a blicket.\n   - Adding objects 5, 0, 6, 1, 3, and 7 did not change the light status when object 2 was already on the machine, indicating they do not independently affect the light.\n\n5. **Final Analysis:**\n   - The light turned off only when objects 2 and 6 were removed, indicating they are the necessary blickets.\n   - Object 7 was added and removed multiple times without affecting the light status, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 1239, "total_tokens": 1652}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072275, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/17/action_log_trial-46.jsonl"}
