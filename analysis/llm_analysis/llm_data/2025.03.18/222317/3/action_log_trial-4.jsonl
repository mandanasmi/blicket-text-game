Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- If there are multiple objects required to make the machine turn on, all objects required are blickets.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When either object 2 or object 6 is removed, the machine turns off. This suggests that both object 2 and object 6 are required to turn on the machine, indicating they are both blickets.\n\nWhen object 7 was placed on the machine, the machine remained on, but it was already on due to the presence of object 2 and object 6. Removing object 7 did not affect the machine's state, as it stayed on with object 2 and object 6.
