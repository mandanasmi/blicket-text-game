When object 0 is on the machine alone, the light is off, and when object 2 is on the machine alone, the light is also off. This suggests that both objects 0 and 2 are required to turn on the machine, indicating they are both blickets.\n\nObject 7 was initially on the machine, and the light was off. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket, as it does not contribute to turning on the machine when placed alone or with other non-blicket objects.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
