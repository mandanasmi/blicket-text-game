Object 3 is added, and the light remains off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nNow, let's focus on object 5:\n- When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light remained on, but object 1 was also on the machine at that time. Therefore, we cannot conclude that object 5 is a blicket based on this interaction alone.\n- There is no other interaction involving object 5 that provides additional information.\n\nSince the only time object 5 was on the machine, object 1 was also present, and object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket, we cannot definitively say that object 5 is a blicket. The evidence suggests that object 5 does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 447, "prompt_tokens": 684, "total_tokens": 1131}, "estimated_cost": 0.00618, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/7/action_log_trial-24.jsonl"}
