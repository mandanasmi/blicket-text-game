This further supports the idea that object 4, in combination with object 1, turns the machine on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on when both objects 1 and 4 are on it. Object 1 alone can turn the machine on, but object 4 cannot. However, object 4 contributes to turning the machine on when combined with object 1, indicating that object 4 is a blicket because its presence affects the state of the machine when combined with another blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 4 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 903, "total_tokens": 1261}, "estimated_cost": 0.0058375, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/3/action_log_trial-13.jsonl"}
