This suggests that object 4 alone does not have the property to turn the machine on.\n   - When object 4 was removed, the machine remained off, indicating that object 4's presence or absence did not affect the machine's state.\n   - The machine turned on when object 7 was placed on it, suggesting object 7 is a blicket.\n   - The machine turned off when object 1 was removed, suggesting object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - The machine turned on again when object 0 was placed back on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the presence or absence of object 4 did not affect the machine's state, object 4 does not have the property of a blicket. A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine. Since object 4's presence or absence did not change the machine's state, it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the definition of a blicket, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 490, "prompt_tokens": 876, "total_tokens": 1366}, "estimated_cost": 0.00709, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/3/action_log_trial-5.jsonl"}
