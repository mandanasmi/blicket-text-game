There is no evidence that object 5 is needed to turn the machine on or off.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence involving object 5, and the fact that the machine's behavior can be explained by the presence of objects 0 and 1, we conclude that object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 391, "prompt_tokens": 769, "total_tokens": 1160}, "estimated_cost": 0.005832500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/3/action_log_trial-20.jsonl"}
