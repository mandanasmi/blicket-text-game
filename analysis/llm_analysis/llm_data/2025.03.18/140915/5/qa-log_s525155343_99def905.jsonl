This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Key Observations:**\n   - When object 1 was placed on the machine, the machine turned on. This indicates that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 6 was removed from the machine, the machine turned off, suggesting that object 6 might also be a blicket, but it requires object 1 to be present to turn the machine on.\n   - When object 1 was placed back on the machine with object 6, the machine turned on again, reinforcing the idea that object 1 is a blicket and possibly object 6 as well.\n\n3. **Object 4 Analysis:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine initially, and the machine did not turn on. This suggests that object 4 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was later removed from the machine while the machine was off, and there was no change in the machine's state.
