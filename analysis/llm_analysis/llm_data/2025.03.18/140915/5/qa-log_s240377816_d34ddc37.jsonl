This suggests that object 5 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Actions:**\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the machine stays on. This indicates object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the machine stays on. This indicates object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is placed back on, and the machine stays on. This further confirms object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is removed again, and the machine stays on. This is consistent with previous observations.\n   - Object 6 is placed on the machine, and the machine stays on. This suggests object 6 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the machine stays on.
