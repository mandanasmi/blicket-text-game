This indicates that object 6 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - Objects 3, 4, 2, 1, and 7 are removed one by one, and the machine remains on. This confirms that none of these objects are necessary to keep the machine on, reinforcing that they are not blickets.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the machine turns off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket, but it was not responsible for keeping the machine on since object 6 was the one that turned it on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 6 is confirmed to be a blicket because it turned the machine on when added.\n   - Objects 3, 4, 7, 1, 2, and 0 are not blickets because their presence or absence did not affect the machine turning on or staying on.\n   - Object 5 was never tested, so we have no direct evidence of its effect on the machine. However, since the machine turned on with object 6 and stayed on until object 0 was removed, object 5's status as a blicket cannot be determined from the given interactions.\n\nSince object 5 was not involved in any interaction, we cannot conclude that it is a blicket based on the available evidence.
