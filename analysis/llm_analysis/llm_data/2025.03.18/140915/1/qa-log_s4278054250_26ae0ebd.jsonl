This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Object 5 Interaction:**\n   - When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.

This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket, but its removal coincided with the light turning off, which is consistent with object 5 being the only blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, object 6 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light, either when placed or removed. The light's behavior is consistent with object 5 being the only blicket.
