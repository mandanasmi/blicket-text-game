Initially, the machine is off with object 5 on it. Objects 3, 2, 0, 7, and 1 are added one by one, but the machine remains off. This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. When object 6 is added to the machine, the light turns on. This indicates that object 6 might be a blicket, as it is the only new addition that caused the machine to turn on.\n\n3. After object 6 is added, objects 2, 0, 5, 3, and 1 are removed one by one, and the machine remains on. This further supports that object 6 is likely a blicket because the removal of other objects does not affect the machine's state.\n\n4. When object 1 is removed, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket, as its presence is necessary to keep the machine on.\n\n5. Object 1 is then placed back on the machine, and the light turns on again. This confirms that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n\n6. Finally, object 7 is removed, and the machine remains on, indicating that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom this sequence, we can infer that both objects 6 and 1 are blickets.
