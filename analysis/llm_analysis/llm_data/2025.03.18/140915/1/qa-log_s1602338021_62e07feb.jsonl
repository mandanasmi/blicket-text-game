This indicates object 2 is likely a blicket.\n\n4. **Removing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light stays on. This confirms object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Removing Object 4:**\n   - Object 4 is removed, and the light stays on. This further suggests object 4 is not a blicket, as its removal does not affect the light.\n\n6. **Interaction with Object 6:**\n   - Object 6 is added, and the light remains on. This suggests object 6 might be a blicket, but we need more information.\n\n7. **Removing Object 2:**\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n\n8. **Interaction with Object 1:**\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains off. Object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n9. **Interaction with Object 0:**\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light turns on. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n\n10. **Re-adding Object 4:**\n    - Object 4 is added, and the light stays on. Since object 0 is already a blicket, object 4's addition does not provide new information.\n\n11. **Removing Object 4:**\n    - Object 4 is removed, and the light stays on. This further supports that object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n12. **Removing Object 0:**\n    - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n\n13. **Interaction with Object 5:**\n    - Object 5 is added, and the light remains off. Object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n14. **Interaction with Object 7:**\n    - Object 7 is added, and the light remains off. Object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom the above interactions, object 4 does not seem to affect the machine's light when added or removed, especially when other known blickets are involved. Therefore, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 568, "prompt_tokens": 743, "total_tokens": 1311}, "estimated_cost": 0.0075375, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/7/action_log_trial-29.jsonl"}
