This suggests that neither object 5 nor object 3 is a blicket on their own.\n   \n2. **Object 7 Interaction:**\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - After removing object 5 and then object 3, the light stayed on, confirming that neither object 5 nor object 3 is necessary for the light to be on. This further supports that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Adding Object 4:**\n   - With object 7 still on the machine, adding object 4 kept the light on. This doesn't provide new information about object 5.\n\n5. **Removing Object 7:**\n   - Removing object 7 turned the light off, confirming that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n6. **Testing Other Objects:**\n   - Objects 0, 2, 6 were tested individually, and the light remained off, indicating they are not blickets.\n   - When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that object 1 is also a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 5 was tested initially, and the light was off. It was also removed when the light was on (due to object 7), and the light remained on. This indicates that object 5 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n- The only objects that turned the light on were objects 7 and 1. Therefore, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 384, "prompt_tokens": 685, "total_tokens": 1069}, "estimated_cost": 0.0055525, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/7/action_log_trial-11.jsonl"}
