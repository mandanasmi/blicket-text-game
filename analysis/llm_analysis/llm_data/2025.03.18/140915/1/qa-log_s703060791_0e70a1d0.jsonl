Removing object 1 turns the machine off, confirming that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n\n7. Finally, adding object 3 does not turn the machine on, which suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom this analysis, it appears that object 1 is the only object that consistently keeps the machine on. Object 4 initially seemed to be a blicket, but since the machine stayed on after removing it, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 854, "total_tokens": 1235}, "estimated_cost": 0.005945000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/7/action_log_trial-31.jsonl"}
