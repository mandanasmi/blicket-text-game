The machine was on with object 3, and it stayed on until object 2 was removed, confirming that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 is a blicket because it turned the machine on.\n   - Object 2 is not a blicket because removing it turned the machine off.\n   - Objects 0, 4, and 6 are not blickets because their removal did not affect the machine's state.\n\nSince object 5 was never tested, we have no direct evidence of its blicket status. However, based on the interactions, the machine turns on with object 3, and no other object has shown the ability to turn the machine on or keep it on when object 3 is not present. Therefore, without evidence of object 5 interacting with the machine, we cannot conclude that it is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 482, "prompt_tokens": 618, "total_tokens": 1100}, "estimated_cost": 0.006364999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/3/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
