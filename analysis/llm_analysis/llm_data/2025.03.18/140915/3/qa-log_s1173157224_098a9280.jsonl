This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Removing objects 6 and 2 did not turn off the light, confirming they are not blickets.\n   - Adding object 6 again with object 0 still on the machine kept the light on, which is consistent with object 0 being a blicket.\n   - Adding object 7 with object 0 on the machine kept the light on, but when object 0 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was added, and the light turned on, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 0 again with object 3 on the machine kept the light on, consistent with both being blickets.\n   - Adding object 5 with object 0 on the machine kept the light on, but removing object 0 turned the light off, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 4:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine alone, and the light remained off. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was also placed on the machine alone, and the light remained off, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the interactions, object 4 does not cause the machine to turn on when placed alone. Therefore, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 391, "prompt_tokens": 834, "total_tokens": 1225}, "estimated_cost": 0.005995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/7/action_log_trial-17.jsonl"}
