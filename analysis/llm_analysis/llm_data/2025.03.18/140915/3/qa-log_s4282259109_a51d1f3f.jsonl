This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket, and the machine was on due to object 6.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on only when object 6 is on it, indicating that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Since object 5 was never placed on the machine, we have no direct evidence of its effect. However, based on the interactions, the machine's behavior seems to be controlled solely by object 6. Therefore, without evidence to suggest otherwise, we assume object 5 is not a blicket.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 678, "total_tokens": 1016}, "estimated_cost": 0.005075, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/3/action_log_trial-24.jsonl"}
