This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - After object 2 turned the machine on, object 0 was removed, and the light stayed on. This confirms that object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 5 turned the light off, suggesting that object 5, in combination with object 2, can turn the machine on. This implies that object 5 might be a blicket, but it requires object 2 to activate the machine.\n   - Removing object 7 did not affect the light status, confirming that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Re-testing Object 5:**\n   - When object 5 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on.
