Initially, object 5 is on the machine, and the light is off. This suggests that object 5 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n2. Objects 3, 2, 0, 7, and 1 are sequentially placed on the machine, and the light remains off.

Objects 2, 0, 5, 3, and 1 are removed one by one, and the light remains on until object 1 is removed. This indicates that object 1, in combination with object 6, keeps the light on.
