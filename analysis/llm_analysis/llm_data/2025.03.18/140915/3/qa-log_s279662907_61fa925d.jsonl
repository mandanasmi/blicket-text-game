This suggests that object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - The fact that the light stayed on after object 4 was removed implies that one or more of the other objects (2, 6, or 5) must be responsible for the light being on.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 4 is not a blicket because the light remained on even after it was removed from the machine.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 862, "total_tokens": 1277}, "estimated_cost": 0.006305, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/7/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
