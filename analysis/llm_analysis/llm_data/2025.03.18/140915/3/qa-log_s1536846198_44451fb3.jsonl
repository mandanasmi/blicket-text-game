This suggests that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 7 is also a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - After object 5 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 5 alone can activate the machine.\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, and it remained on even after objects 0, 1, 2, 4 were removed. This suggests that these objects do not affect the machine's state when object 7 is present.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 4:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine with other objects (0, 1, 2, 3, 6) and the light remained off, indicating that object 4 alone or in combination with these objects does not activate the machine.\n   - When object 7 was on the machine, the light was on, and removing object 4 did not turn the light off. This suggests that object 4 does not contribute to the machine's activation.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on with object 5 or object 7, indicating these are blickets.\n   - Object 4 does not activate the machine on its own or in combination with non-blicket objects, and its presence or absence does not affect the machine's state when a blicket (object 7) is present.\n\nTherefore, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 418, "prompt_tokens": 920, "total_tokens": 1338}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064800000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/130041/3/action_log_trial-25.jsonl"}
