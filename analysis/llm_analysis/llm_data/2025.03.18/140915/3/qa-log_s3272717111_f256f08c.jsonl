This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n   \n2. **Key Interaction:**\n   - When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 has the ability to turn the machine on, either by itself or in combination with other objects.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - After object 6 was placed on the machine, objects 5 and 1 were removed, and the light remained on. This suggests that neither object 5 nor object 1 is necessary for the machine to be on, reinforcing the idea that object 6 is responsible for the light being on.\n   - Finally, when object 7 was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 7 was not contributing to the machine being on, further isolating object 6 as the key factor.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The fact that the light turned on when object 6 was placed on the machine and remained on until object 6 was the only object left strongly suggests that object 6 is a blicket.
