This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Object 0 Interaction:**\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - After object 0 was placed, the light was on. Objects 7 and 3 were removed, and the light stayed on. This suggests that neither object 7 nor object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, reinforcing that object 0 is the key object.\n   - When object 1 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket, as its removal did not affect the light when object 0 was present.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light turned on with object 0 and stayed on after removing object 7, object 7 does not contribute to turning the machine on.
