This is inconsistent with the previous observation where object 0 seemed to turn the machine on. This suggests that the rule might involve a combination of objects or that object 0 alone is not sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\n5. **Inference:**\n   - Since the machine turned on when both object 0 and object 2 were on it, but turned off when object 2 was removed, it suggests that object 2 might actually be a blicket, and the machine requires both object 0 and object 2 to be on to turn on.
