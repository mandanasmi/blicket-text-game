This suggests that object 0 could be a blicket.\n\n3. **Interaction with Object 2:**\n   - With object 0 still on the machine, object 2 is added, and the light remains on.

This strongly indicates that object 0 is indeed a blicket, as its removal directly causes the light to turn off.\n\n5. **Interaction with Object 1:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on.
