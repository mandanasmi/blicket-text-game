However, it was also removed from the machine, and the light remained on, which suggests that the light being on is not dependent on object 6 alone.\n   - The light was consistently on when other objects (4, 5, and 7) were present, but we have not seen the light turn off when object 6 was removed.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the light was on with object 6 on the machine but also remained on when it was removed, we cannot definitively conclude that object 6 is a blicket. It may or may not be a blicket, but the evidence does not support it being a necessary condition for the machine to turn on.\n\nThus, based on the information collected, we conclude that object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
