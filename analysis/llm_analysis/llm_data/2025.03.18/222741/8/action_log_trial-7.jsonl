This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was initially on the machine, and when it was taken off, the light remained off. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket, as the light did not turn off when it was removed.\n\n2. **Further Testing**: \n   - Object 6 was repeatedly placed on the machine, and the light consistently turned on, confirming its status as a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was taken off the machine, and the light remained on, which is contradictory. However, since the light was on when object 6 was present, it indicates that object 6 is the cause of the light being on, not object 7.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the interactions, object 6 is a blicket, while objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are not.
