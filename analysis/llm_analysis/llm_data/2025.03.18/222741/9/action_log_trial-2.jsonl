Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'.

When object 7 was put on the machine, the light turned on, and when it was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 7 has blicktness. \n\nAdditionally, when object 1 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, suggesting that it does not have blicktness. Since the machine turned on with object 7 and not with object 1, it supports the conclusion that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
