You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- If there are multiple objects required to make the machine turn on, all objects required are blickets.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This indicates that at least one of them is a blicket.\n2. **Object 6**: When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light was off when it was the only object present. This suggests that object 6 is not a blicket.\n3. **Object 7**: The light turned on when object 7 was placed on the machine, but we have not tested it in isolation to confirm if it is a blicket or if it requires another object to activate the machine.\n\nSince we have not tested object 7 alone or in combination with other objects to see if it can turn the machine on by itself, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket based on the information we have.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
