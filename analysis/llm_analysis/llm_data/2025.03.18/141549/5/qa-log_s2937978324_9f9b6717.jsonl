The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n\nBased on the information above, is object 7 a blicket?\n\nPlease provide a detailed chain-of-thought explaining your reasoning, and then output the final answer in the format '> True/False'.

The lack of interaction means we have no evidence to support it being a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 1279, "total_tokens": 1603}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064375000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-24.jsonl"}
