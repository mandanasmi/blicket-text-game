This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is removed, the light turns off, confirming object 2's role in turning the light on.\n   - When object 4 is placed on the machine, the light remains off.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine while object 2 is already on, the light remains on, indicating object 1 does not affect the light.\n   - When object 5 is placed on the machine while the light is on, the light remains on, suggesting object 5 does not affect the light.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine while the light is on, the light remains on, suggesting object 3 does not affect the light.\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine while the light is on, the light remains on, suggesting object 7 does not affect the light.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was off, and the light remained off.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was on (with object 2), and the light remained on.\n   - There is no evidence that object 7 independently causes the light to turn on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2, indicating object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 does not independently cause the light to turn on, nor does it affect the light when it is already on.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 475, "prompt_tokens": 1283, "total_tokens": 1758}, "estimated_cost": 0.0079575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-27.jsonl"}
