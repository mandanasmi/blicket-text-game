This suggests that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Observations:**\n   - After object 2 was placed, additional objects (4, 5, 3, 1, 0, 7) were added or removed, but the light remained on. This suggests that once the machine is on, adding or removing non-blicket objects does not affect the state of the machine.\n\n3. **Specific Observations with Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine after the light was already on (due to object 2 being on the machine). The light remained on.\n   - Object 7 was placed again on the machine, but the light was already on, so this does not provide new information.\n   - Object 7 was never the sole object placed on the machine to test if it could turn the machine on by itself.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 7 was only placed on the machine when the light was already on, we cannot definitively say that object 7 is a blicket based on the given interactions. The light being on could be due to other objects (like object 2) being on the machine.\n   - There is no evidence from the interactions that object 7 independently causes the machine to turn on.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, object 7 is not confirmed to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 1279, "total_tokens": 1655}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-47.jsonl"}
