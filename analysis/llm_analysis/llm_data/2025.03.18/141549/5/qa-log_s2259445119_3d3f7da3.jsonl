Ensure only one answer is included.", "question_obj_idx": 7, "question_obj_name": "object 7", "response_msg": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions and the state of the machine.\n\n1. **Initial State**: The machine is off, and object 7 is on the machine. This suggests that object 7 alone does not turn the machine on, as the machine is off with object 7 on it.\n\n2. **Removing Object 7**: When object 7 is removed from the machine, the machine remains off. This further supports that object 7 does not affect the machine's state when it is the only object on the machine.\n\n3. **Other Objects**: \n   - Objects 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, and 6 were placed on the machine at various times, and the machine remained off.\n   - When object 5 was placed on the machine, the machine turned on. This indicates that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - The machine remained on when object 3 was added and when object 0 was removed, suggesting that object 5 alone is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the machine was off when object 7 was on it alone, and the machine turned on only when object 5 was placed on it, object 7 does not have any effect on the machine's state. Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 1281, "total_tokens": 1569}, "estimated_cost": 0.0060825, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-41.jsonl"}
