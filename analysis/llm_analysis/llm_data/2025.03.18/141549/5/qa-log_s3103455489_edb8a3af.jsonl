When removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 6: Placing or removing object 6 does not affect the machine's state, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 and 5: Placing these objects on the machine does not turn the light on unless object 0 or 3 is also on the machine, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Object 7:**\n   - Since object 7 was never placed on the machine, we cannot directly observe its effect on the machine.\n   - However, given that the machine's state never changed when object 7 was interacted with (always on the floor), and considering the behavior of other objects, it is reasonable to infer that object 7 does not affect the machine.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is likely not a blicket, as it does not seem to have any influence on the machine's state.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 1281, "total_tokens": 1691}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
