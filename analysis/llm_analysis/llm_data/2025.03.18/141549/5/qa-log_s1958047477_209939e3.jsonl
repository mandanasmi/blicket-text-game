The lack of evidence against it, combined with the fact that it was not tested, suggests it could potentially be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 364, "prompt_tokens": 1282, "total_tokens": 1646}, "estimated_cost": 0.006845, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-13.jsonl"}
