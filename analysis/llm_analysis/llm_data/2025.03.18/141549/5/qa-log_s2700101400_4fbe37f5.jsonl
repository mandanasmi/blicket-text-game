This is the first instance where the machine turns on.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the machine remains on.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the machine remains on.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the machine turns off.\n   - Object 7 is placed back on the machine, and the machine turns on again.\n\n4. **Analysis:**\n   - The machine turns on when object 7 is placed on it, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - The machine turns off when object 7 is removed, even if other objects remain on the machine.\n   - This indicates that object 7 has a direct influence on the state of the machine.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the presence of object 7 correlates with the machine being on, and its removal correlates with the machine turning off, object 7 is a blicket. It is the only object whose presence or absence directly affects the machine's state.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect of object 7 on the machine, we conclude that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 1281, "total_tokens": 1646}, "estimated_cost": 0.006852499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
