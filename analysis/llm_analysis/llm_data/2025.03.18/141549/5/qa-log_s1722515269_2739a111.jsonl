This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine, and the light remains on, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is placed and removed, and the light remains on, suggesting object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is placed on the machine, and the light remains on, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off, suggesting object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is placed on the machine, and the light remains on, suggesting object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Object 7:**\n   - Every time object 7 is placed on the machine, the light remains off.\n   - When object 7 is removed, the light remains on, indicating that object 7 does not affect the state of the machine's light.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not influence the machine's light and therefore does not have the property of a blicket. The machine's light is primarily influenced by object 0, and possibly object 2, but not by object 7.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 497, "prompt_tokens": 1280, "total_tokens": 1777}, "estimated_cost": 0.00817, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
