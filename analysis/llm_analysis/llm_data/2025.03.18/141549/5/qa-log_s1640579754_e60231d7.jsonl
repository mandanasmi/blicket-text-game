Object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, nor does its removal cause the machine to turn off when object 2 is present.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's state independently. Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 315, "prompt_tokens": 1284, "total_tokens": 1599}, "estimated_cost": 0.00636, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-5.jsonl"}
