This further supports that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Interactions Involving Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine when the light is off, and the light remains off. This suggests that object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n   - Object 3 is removed from the machine when the light is on, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 3 is not necessary to keep the light on.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine again when the light is on, and the light remains on.

The machine's state is unaffected by object 7's presence or absence when object 0 is not on the machine.\n   - Therefore, object 7 does not have blicktness, as it does not influence the machine's state.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 311, "prompt_tokens": 1286, "total_tokens": 1597}, "estimated_cost": 0.006325000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-29.jsonl"}
