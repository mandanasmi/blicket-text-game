This suggests that these objects do not independently affect the light.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - After the light turns off, placing objects 2, 6, 5, and 1 on the machine does not turn the light back on. This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n   - When object 0 is placed back on the machine, the light turns on again, confirming object 0's status as a blicket.\n   - Placing object 7 on the machine while object 0 is already on the machine keeps the light on, but this does not provide information about object 7's independent effect.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The key observation is that the light turns on and off solely based on the presence of object 0. Object 7 does not independently affect the light, as the light remains on or off depending on object 0's presence.\n   - Since the light does not turn on when object 7 is placed on the machine without object 0, object 7 does not have the property of a blicket.\n\nTherefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 1286, "total_tokens": 1633}, "estimated_cost": 0.006685, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-37.jsonl"}
