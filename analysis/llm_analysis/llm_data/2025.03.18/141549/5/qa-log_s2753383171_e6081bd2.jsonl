With object 0 on the machine, removing object 6 does not turn the machine off, indicating object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n6. Removing object 4 does not turn the machine off, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n7. Removing object 3 turns the machine off. This suggests that object 3, in combination with object 0, is necessary to keep the machine on. This indicates that object 3 is a blicket because its presence affects the state of the machine.\n\n8. After object 3 is removed and the machine turns off, adding object 1 does not turn the machine back on, reinforcing that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n9.

The machine turns off when object 3 is removed, indicating that object 3 has a direct effect on the machine's state.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 399, "prompt_tokens": 1283, "total_tokens": 1682}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}

Since object 7 does not influence the machine's state, it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the state of the machine, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 384, "prompt_tokens": 1283, "total_tokens": 1667}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070475, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}
