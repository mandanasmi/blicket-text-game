The light remains on.\n   - Object 7 is removed from the machine, and the light remains on, indicating object 7 is not necessary to keep the light on.\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine again when the light is on, and the light remains on.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light turns off when object 4 is removed, regardless of other objects on the machine, indicating object 4 is a necessary blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 7 is removed, suggesting object 7 does not contribute to the machine being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the removal of object 7 does not affect the state of the machine (it remains on), object 7 does not have the property of a blicket. A blicket would affect the machine's state when removed.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 1282, "total_tokens": 1598}, "estimated_cost": 0.006364999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-52.jsonl"}
