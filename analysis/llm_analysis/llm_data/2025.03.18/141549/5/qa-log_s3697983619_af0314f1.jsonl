The light remains on.\n   - Object 7 is later removed from the machine, and the light remains on, indicating that object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - The light turns off when object 1 is removed, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n   - The light remains off when object 6 is placed on the machine, suggesting object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - The light turns on when object 0 is placed on the machine, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when objects 3, 4, and 5 are placed on the machine, suggesting they do not independently affect the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Object 7:**\n   - Since the light was already on when object 7 was placed on the machine and remained on when object 7 was removed, object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n   - Therefore, object 7 does not have a direct effect on the machine's state and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 375, "prompt_tokens": 1282, "total_tokens": 1657}, "estimated_cost": 0.006954999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-14.jsonl"}
