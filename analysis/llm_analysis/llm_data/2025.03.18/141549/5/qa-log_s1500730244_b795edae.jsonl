This suggests that object 6 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is added, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 4 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 6 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on, suggesting object 5 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Interactions with Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 7 is removed while the light is on (due to other objects), and the light remains on.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The light does not turn on when object 7 is placed on the machine, indicating that object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n   - The light remains on when object 7 is removed, but this is because other objects (like object 6) are likely causing the machine to stay on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since placing object 7 on the machine does not turn the light on, and removing it does not affect the light when it is on due to other objects, object 7 does not seem to have any effect on the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 1282, "total_tokens": 1663}, "estimated_cost": 0.007015, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-7.jsonl"}
