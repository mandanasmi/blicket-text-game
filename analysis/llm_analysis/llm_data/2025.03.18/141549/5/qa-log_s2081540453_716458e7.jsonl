This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - After object 3 is placed on the machine, other objects (including object 7) are placed on the machine, but the light remains on. This suggests that once the machine is on, additional objects do not affect the state unless they are removed.\n\n4. **Removal of Objects:**\n   - Object 1 is removed from the machine, and the light remains on. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed from the machine, and the light remains on. This suggests object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since placing object 7 on the machine does not turn the light on, and removing other objects does not turn the light off, object 7 does not seem to have any effect on the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket, as it does not influence the machine's state.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 356, "prompt_tokens": 1280, "total_tokens": 1636}, "estimated_cost": 0.00676, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-25.jsonl"}
