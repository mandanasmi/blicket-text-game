This indicates that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on, further suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Re-adding Object 3**:\n   - Object 3 is re-added to the machine while the light is on, and the light remains on. This does not provide new information about object 3's status as a blicket because object 0 is still on the machine, keeping the light on.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The key observation is that the light turns on with object 0 and remains on regardless of the presence or absence of object 3.
