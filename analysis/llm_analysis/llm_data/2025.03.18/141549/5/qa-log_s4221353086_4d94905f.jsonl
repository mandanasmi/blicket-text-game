This suggests that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - After object 4 is placed on the machine, the light remains on regardless of other objects being added or removed, as long as object 4 remains on the machine.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was off, and it did not turn the light on. This suggests that object 7 alone does not have the property to turn the machine on.\n   - After object 4 is placed on the machine and the light is on, adding or removing other objects, including object 7, does not affect the light status as long as object 4 remains on the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 7 does not turn the machine on when placed alone, and the light status does not change when object 7 is added or removed while object 4 is on the machine, object 7 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket, as it does not influence the machine's state.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 1279, "total_tokens": 1629}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
