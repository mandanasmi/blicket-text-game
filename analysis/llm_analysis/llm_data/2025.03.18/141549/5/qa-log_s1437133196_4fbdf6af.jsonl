The definition of a blicket requires that the object's state is not independent of the machine's state. Without testing object 7, we have no information about its effect on the machine.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 457, "prompt_tokens": 1281, "total_tokens": 1738}, "estimated_cost": 0.0077725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-35.jsonl"}
