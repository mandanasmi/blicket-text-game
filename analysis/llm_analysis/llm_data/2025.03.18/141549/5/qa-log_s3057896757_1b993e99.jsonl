Again, inconclusive for object 6.\n   - Objects 0, 3, 2, and 7 are repeatedly placed on the machine, and the light remains on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket, but it doesn't isolate which one.\n   - Objects 3, 0, 4, and 2 are removed sequentially, and the light remains on until object 2 is removed. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light turns off. This suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is placed back on the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turned off only when object 6 was removed, indicating object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2's removal also turned the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was removed, and the light remained on, indicating object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.

This suggests object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Objects 3 and 6 are added, and the light remains on. This suggests that objects 3 and 6 might also be blickets.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light remains on. This suggests object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains on, suggesting that object 2 might not be the sole reason for the light being on.\n\n3. **Critical Observations:**\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light turns off. This strongly suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - After object 6 is removed, the light turns off, even though object 7 is still on the machine. This indicates that object 7 does not contribute to the light being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns off when object 6 is removed, confirming object 6 is a blicket.\n   - The light does not turn on when object 7 is placed on the machine, nor does it stay on when object 6 is removed, indicating object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not affect the state of the machine and is therefore not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 382, "prompt_tokens": 1281, "total_tokens": 1663}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
