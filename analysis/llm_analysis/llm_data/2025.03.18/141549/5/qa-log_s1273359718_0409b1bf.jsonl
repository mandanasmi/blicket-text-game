This does not provide information about object 7's status as a blicket.\n   - Later, object 7 is placed on the machine when the light is off (with objects 3, 5, and 4 involved at different times), and the light remains off. This suggests that object 7 does not independently cause the light to turn on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 and object 6, indicating they are blickets.\n   - Object 7 does not cause the light to turn on when placed on the machine alone or with other non-blicket objects.\n   - Therefore, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket, as its presence does not correlate with the machine turning on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 352, "prompt_tokens": 1284, "total_tokens": 1636}, "estimated_cost": 0.00673, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-23.jsonl"}
