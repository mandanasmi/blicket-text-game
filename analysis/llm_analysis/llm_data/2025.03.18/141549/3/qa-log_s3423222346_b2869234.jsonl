This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 is added to the machine when the light is already on (with object 0 on the machine), and the light remains on. This does not provide information about object 7's individual effect.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light turns off only when object 0 is removed and not when object 7 is removed, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket. The light's behavior is consistent with object 0 being the only necessary object for the light to be on.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 421, "prompt_tokens": 1240, "total_tokens": 1661}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073100000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-33.jsonl"}
