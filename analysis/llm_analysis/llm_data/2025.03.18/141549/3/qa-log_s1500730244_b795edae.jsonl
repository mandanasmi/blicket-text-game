This suggests object 6 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is added, and the light remains on. This suggests object 4 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light stays on, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing that object 6 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 5 is added, and the light turns on. This suggests object 5 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is added, and the light remains off, suggesting object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is added again, and the light turns on, confirming object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light stays on, further indicating object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on with objects 6, 4, and 5, suggesting these are blickets.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. Additionally, when object 7 was removed, the light stayed on, indicating it had no effect on the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 1241, "total_tokens": 1642}, "estimated_cost": 0.007112499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-7.jsonl"}
