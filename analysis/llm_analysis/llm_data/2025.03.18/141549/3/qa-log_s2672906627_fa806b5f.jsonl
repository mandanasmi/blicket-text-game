This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is already on the machine when the light is on, suggesting it might not be a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine while the light is on, but object 2 is already on the machine, so we can't determine if object 7 is a blicket from this alone.\n   - Object 4 is removed, and the light turns off, suggesting object 4 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 4 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on, reinforcing that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light remains on, suggesting object 5 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine while the light is on, but object 4 is already on the machine, so we can't determine if object 1 is a blicket from this alone.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 5 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on when object 2 or object 4 is on it, indicating they are blickets.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was already on due to object 2, so we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket based on the available information.\n   - There is no instance where object 7 alone or in combination with non-blicket objects turns the machine on.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not confirmed to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 575, "prompt_tokens": 1239, "total_tokens": 1814}, "estimated_cost": 0.008847500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
