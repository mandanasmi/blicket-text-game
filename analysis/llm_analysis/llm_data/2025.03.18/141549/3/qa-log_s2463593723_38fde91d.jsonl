This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 7, 5, 3, and 6 are removed, and the light remains off. This suggests that none of these objects are necessary to keep the light on.\n\n4. **Re-adding Objects**:\n   - Objects 5, 3, 6, and 4 are re-added, and the light remains off. This further supports that these objects are not blickets.\n   - Object 7 was on the machine when the light was on, but removing it did not affect the light status when object 0 was removed.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The light turned off only when object 0 was removed, indicating that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was on the machine when the light was on, but its removal did not affect the light status when object 0 was removed. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 1241, "total_tokens": 1579}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064824999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-9.jsonl"}
