This is the first instance where the light turns on, indicating that object 7 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing the idea that object 7 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is added again, and the light turns on again, further supporting that object 7 is a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 6 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light turns off, confirming that object 7 is crucial for the light to be on.\n   - Object 0 is added later, and the light turns on, suggesting object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on only when object 7 is on the machine, and it turns off when object 7 is removed. This consistent behavior strongly suggests that object 7 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions and the machine's responses, object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 391, "prompt_tokens": 1238, "total_tokens": 1629}, "estimated_cost": 0.007005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
