This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 3, as the light was already on due to object 2.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 6 was added, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 6 might also be a blicket.\n   - Objects 0, 4, and 7 were added, and the light stayed on. Since object 2 was already on the machine, these actions do not provide new information about these objects.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Object 3 was removed, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 was removed, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 0 might not be a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was removed, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 4 might not be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was removed, and the light stayed on. This is surprising, as object 2 initially turned the light on. However, object 6 was still on the machine, which might be a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 6 was removed, and the light turned off. This strongly suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 was placed back on, and the light stayed off. This confirms object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was placed on, and the light stayed off. This suggests object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The key observation is that when object 3 was removed, the light stayed on, indicating object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on. The light only turned off when object 6 was removed, suggesting object 6 is a blicket.\n- Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 500, "prompt_tokens": 1240, "total_tokens": 1740}, "estimated_cost": 0.0081, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
