This suggests that object 4 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 7 is added to the machine while object 4 is on it, and the light remains on. This does not provide information about object 7 being a blicket because object 4 is already causing the light to be on.\n   - When object 4 is removed, the light turns off, even if object 7 is still on the machine. This indicates that object 7 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n4. **Additional Interactions:**\n   - Object 4 is added again, and the light turns on. Object 7 is already on the machine, but the light was off before object 4 was added.\n   - Removing object 4 again turns the light off, confirming that object 4 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 4 is on the machine, regardless of whether object 7 is present or not.\n   - Object 7 does not independently cause the light to turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 355, "prompt_tokens": 1239, "total_tokens": 1594}, "estimated_cost": 0.006647500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-9.jsonl"}
