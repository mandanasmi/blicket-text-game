This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 2 is placed again, and the light turns on.\n   - Object 4 is added to the machine with object 2, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off, even though object 4 is still on the machine. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine multiple times, and each time the light remains off.\n   - Object 7 is on the machine with other objects (e.g., objects 0, 1, 3, 6, 5), and the light remains off.\n   - The only time the light turns on is when object 2 is on the machine, either alone or with other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, object 7 does not cause the machine to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects. The only object that consistently causes the machine to turn on is object 2. Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 342, "prompt_tokens": 1243, "total_tokens": 1585}, "estimated_cost": 0.0065275, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-39.jsonl"}
