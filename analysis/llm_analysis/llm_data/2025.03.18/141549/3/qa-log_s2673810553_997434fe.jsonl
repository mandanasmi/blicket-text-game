This is the first instance where the light changes from off to on, indicating that object 7 might be a blicket.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - After object 7 is placed on the machine, the light remains on even when other objects (5, 3, 4, 2) are added or removed.\n   - Importantly, when object 7 is removed, the light remains on, suggesting that object 7 alone is not responsible for keeping the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turning on when object 7 is placed on the machine suggests that object 7 is a blicket.\n   - The fact that the light remains on after object 7 is removed indicates that there might be other blickets or a combination rule, but the initial activation strongly suggests object 7 has blicktness.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is likely a blicket because it was the first object to cause the light to turn on.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 311, "prompt_tokens": 1239, "total_tokens": 1550}, "estimated_cost": 0.006207500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
