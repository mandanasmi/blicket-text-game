The machine's light does not provide any evidence of object 7's status as a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 1243, "total_tokens": 1525}, "estimated_cost": 0.0059275000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-61.jsonl"}
