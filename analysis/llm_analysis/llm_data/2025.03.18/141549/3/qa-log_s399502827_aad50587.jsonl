This suggests that object 7 does not affect the machine's light status.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, but this is because object 5 was removed, not due to object 7.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light only turns on with object 5 and not with object 7, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 1241, "total_tokens": 1637}, "estimated_cost": 0.007062499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-21.jsonl"}
