This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - With object 3 on the machine, adding object 6 kept the light on, and removing object 6 turned the light off. This suggests that object 6 is also a blicket.\n   - With object 6 on the machine, adding object 0 kept the light on, and removing object 3 turned the light off. This suggests that object 0 is also a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine multiple times, and each time the light remained off.\n   - Object 7 was never involved in any scenario where the light turned on, either alone or in combination with other objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turned on with objects 3, 6, and 0, indicating they are blickets.\n   - Object 7 was tested multiple times, and the light never turned on, suggesting it does not have the property of blicktness.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 382, "prompt_tokens": 1243, "total_tokens": 1625}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069275, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
