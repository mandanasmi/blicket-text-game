However, it was placed when other objects were already on the machine.\n   - Importantly, when object 4 was removed, the light remained on with object 3 still on the machine. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket because the light stayed on without object 4, which was previously confirmed as a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation:**\n   - The light remained on with object 3 on the machine, even after removing object 4, which was a known blicket. This indicates that object 3 itself can keep the light on, confirming it as a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 472, "prompt_tokens": 1240, "total_tokens": 1712}, "estimated_cost": 0.00782, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}

This suggests that object 7 alone is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 5 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests that object 4 is also likely a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off initially. However, when object 5 was added, the light turned on. Later, object 1 was placed on the machine with other objects, and the light was on. This suggests that object 1 might not be a blicket on its own but could be part of a combination that turns the light on.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light was on. This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket or part of a combination that keeps the light on.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light was on. This suggests that object 6 might be a blicket or part of a combination that keeps the light on.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light was on. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket or part of a combination that keeps the light on.\n   - Object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light was on. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket or part of a combination that keeps the light on.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine initially, and the light remained off. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket on its own.\n   - Throughout the interactions, object 7 was never part of a combination that turned the light on. It was taken off the machine multiple times, and the light remained on, indicating that object 7 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\nBased on the above observations, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket, as it neither turned the light on by itself nor was part of any combination that turned the light on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 502, "prompt_tokens": 1240, "total_tokens": 1742}, "estimated_cost": 0.008119999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}
