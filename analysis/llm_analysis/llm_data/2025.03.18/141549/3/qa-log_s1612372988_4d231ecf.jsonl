This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Adding Object 2**: \n   - Object 2 is added to the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Adding Object 6 and 7**: \n   - Objects 6 and 7 are added to the machine while object 2 is still on it, and the light remains on. This does not provide information about whether objects 6 or 7 are blickets because object 2 is already known to be a blicket and could be keeping the light on.\n\n5. **Removing Object 7**: \n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n\n6. **Removing Object 6**: \n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 6 is not necessary for the light to be on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n\n7. **Adding Object 4**: \n   - Object 4 is added to the machine, and the light remains on. This does not provide information about whether object 4 is a blicket because object 2 is still on the machine.\n\n8. **Removing Object 5**: \n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 5 is not necessary for the light to be on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n\nThroughout these interactions, the only time the light turned on was when object 2 was placed on the machine. The light remained on regardless of the presence of objects 5, 6, 7, and 4, suggesting that these objects do not contribute to the light being on.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 509, "prompt_tokens": 1239, "total_tokens": 1748}, "estimated_cost": 0.0081875, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-31.jsonl"}
