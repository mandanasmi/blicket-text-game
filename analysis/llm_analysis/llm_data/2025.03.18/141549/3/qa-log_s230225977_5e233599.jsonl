This suggests object 5 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is added, light remains on.\n   - Object 7 is already on, light remains on.\n   - Object 0 is removed, light remains on.\n   - Object 1 is added, light remains on.\n   - Object 4 is added, light remains on.\n   - Object 0 is added, light remains on.\n   - Object 6 is already on, light remains on.\n   - Object 7 is already on, light remains on.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - Object 7 is removed, light turns off.
