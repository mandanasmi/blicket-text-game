This suggests that neither object 6 nor object 7 alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Interactions:**\n   - When object 1 is added to the machine with objects 6 and 7, the light remains off. This indicates that object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Objects 4, 5, and 2 are added sequentially, and the light remains off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - When object 0 is added to the machine, the light turns on. This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming that object 0 is necessary to turn the light on.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light remains off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added again, and the light remains off, which is unexpected. However, this could be due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the sequence, but it doesn't affect the conclusion about object 7.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light was off when only objects 6 and 7 were on the machine, and the light turned on only when object 0 was added, it suggests that object 7 alone does not have the property to turn the machine on.\n   - The light turning on with object 0 and off without it strongly indicates that object 0 is the only blicket or at least the primary blicket in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 383, "prompt_tokens": 1247, "total_tokens": 1630}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069475000000000006, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
