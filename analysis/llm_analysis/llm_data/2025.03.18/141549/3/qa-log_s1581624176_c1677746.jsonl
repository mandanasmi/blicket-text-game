Therefore, the presence of object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on in this scenario.\n\n3. **Further Analysis:**\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, even though object 3 is still on the machine. This further confirms that object 3 does not have the ability to turn the machine on by itself.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains off, which is consistent with the previous observations.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on when object 0 is on it, regardless of the presence of object 3. Object 3 alone does not turn the machine on, and its presence does not affect the machine's state when object 0 is not present.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 1242, "total_tokens": 1580}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064849999999999994, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-16.jsonl"}

This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 7 while the light is on (with object 0 on the machine) does not turn the light off, indicating object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 4 on the machine while the light is on (with object 0) does not change the light status, but when object 0 is removed, the light turns off, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine does not turn the light on, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 7 on the machine alone does not turn the light on, indicating object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on only when object 0 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 7 does not turn the light on by itself and does not affect the light status when object 0 is present.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 1242, "total_tokens": 1588}, "estimated_cost": 0.006565, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-16.jsonl"}
