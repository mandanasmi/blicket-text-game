This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Adding Object 0**: The light remains on when object 0 is added. This doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 0, as object 3 is still on the machine.\n\n3. **Adding Object 7**: The light remains on when object 7 is added. Again, this doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 7, as object 3 is still on the machine.\n\n4. **Removing Object 3**: The light turns off when object 3 is removed. This confirms that object 3 is a blicket and was responsible for the light being on.\n\n5. **Subsequent Actions**: After object 3 is removed, various objects (including object 7) are placed on the machine, but the light remains off. This includes:\n   - Object 4 is added, light is off.\n   - Object 0 is added again, light is off.\n   - Object 7 is added again, light is off.\n   - Object 6 is added, light is off.\n   - Object 5 is added, light is off.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the light remains off when object 7 is on the machine without object 3, it indicates that object 7 does not have the property of blicktness. The light only turned on when object 3 was on the machine, and it turned off when object 3 was removed, regardless of the presence of object 7.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 1237, "total_tokens": 1611}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068325, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-58.jsonl"}
