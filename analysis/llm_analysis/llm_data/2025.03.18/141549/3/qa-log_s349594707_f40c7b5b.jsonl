Ensure only one answer is included.", "question_obj_idx": 7, "question_obj_name": "object 7", "response_msg": "To determine if object 7 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions and the state of the machine's light.\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Objects 2 and 4 are on the machine, and the light is off.\n\n2. **Removing Objects**:\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is removed later when the light is on, and the light stays on. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Adding Objects**:\n   - Object 7 is added to the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests object 7 alone does not turn the light on.\n   - Object 6 is added, and the light turns on. This suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Interactions**:\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light stays on. This further suggests object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light stays on. This indicates that there might be another blicket on the machine.\n   - Object 4 is added back, and the light stays on. This does not change the status of object 4 as a non-blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light stays on. This suggests object 0 might be a blicket, as the light remains on without object 6.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 7 was on the machine when the light was off and was removed when the light was on without affecting the light status. This strongly suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 370, "prompt_tokens": 1241, "total_tokens": 1611}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068024999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}
