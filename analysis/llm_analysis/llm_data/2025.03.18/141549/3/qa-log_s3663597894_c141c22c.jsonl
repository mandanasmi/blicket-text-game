This indicates that object 5 is a blicket.\n\n3. After object 5 is on the machine and the light is on, object 7 is removed, and the light remains on. This further suggests that object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on, reinforcing that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n4. The light remains on with object 5 on the machine, even when other objects are added or removed, until object 5 is removed. This confirms that object 5 is the key object (blicket) that turns the machine on.\n\n5. When object 5 is removed, the light turns off, even if other objects like object 3 or object 6 are on the machine. This indicates that neither object 3 nor object 6 is a blicket.\n\n6. Object 7 was initially on the machine with the light off, and when it was removed while the light was on (due to object 5), the light stayed on. This confirms that object 7 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket because it does not cause the machine to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 1242, "total_tokens": 1593}, "estimated_cost": 0.006615, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-20.jsonl"}
