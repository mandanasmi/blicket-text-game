The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take object 6 off the machine\nobject 6 is already on the floor. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n\nBased on the information above, is object 7 a blicket?\n\nPlease provide a detailed chain-of-thought explaining your reasoning, and then output the final answer in the format '> True/False'.

When object 1 is on the machine, the light is on. When object 1 is removed, the light turns off.\n   - Object 7 does not independently cause the light to turn on or off. It was present when the light was both on and off, suggesting it does not have blicktness.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 382, "prompt_tokens": 1240, "total_tokens": 1622}, "estimated_cost": 0.00692, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
