This suggests object 0 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - With objects 0, 3, 5, and 6 on the machine, the light was on. Removing object 3 turned the light off, suggesting object 3 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was on the machine when the light was both on and off, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was on the machine when the light was both on and off, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine initially with object 3, and the light was off.\n   - Object 7 was removed, and the light remained off.\n   - Object 7 was never on the machine when the light was on, and its presence did not turn the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turned on with objects 0 and 3, indicating they are likely blickets.\n   - Object 7's presence did not affect the light turning on, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 326, "prompt_tokens": 1237, "total_tokens": 1563}, "estimated_cost": 0.0063525000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-14.jsonl"}
