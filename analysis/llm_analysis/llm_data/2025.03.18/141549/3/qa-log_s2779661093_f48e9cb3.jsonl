This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Observations:**\n   - With object 0 on the machine, additional objects (6, 5, 1, 4, 7, 2) were placed, and the light remained on. This does not provide information about these objects individually because object 0 is already on the machine, keeping the light on.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - When object 0 was removed, the light turned off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine while object 0 was already on it, so the light stayed on. This does not confirm if object 7 is a blicket because object 0 was already causing the light to be on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no instance where object 7 was placed on the machine without object 0 being present to see if it alone could turn the light on.\n   - Therefore, based on the given interactions, we cannot definitively conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, object 7 cannot be confirmed as a blicket based on the available evidence.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 326, "prompt_tokens": 1238, "total_tokens": 1564}, "estimated_cost": 0.0063549999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-50.jsonl"}
