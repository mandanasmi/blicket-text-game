This suggests that object 4 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - After object 4 was placed on the machine, the light remained on even when other objects were added or removed, except when object 4 was not removed, so we can't confirm if other objects are blickets based on these interactions alone.\n   - Object 1 was added after object 4, and the light stayed on. This does not confirm object 1 as a blicket because object 4 was already on the machine.\n\n4. **Object 7 Specific Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was off (along with objects 0, 5, 6, and 3), and the light remained off. This suggests that object 7 alone does not turn the light on.\n   - When object 7 was on the machine with object 4, the light was on, but this is due to object 4 being a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light did not turn on when object 7 was placed on the machine without object 4, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 371, "prompt_tokens": 1238, "total_tokens": 1609}, "estimated_cost": 0.006805, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
