However, since object 3 did not turn the machine on when placed alone, it is unlikely to be a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 1242, "total_tokens": 1649}, "estimated_cost": 0.007175000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-18.jsonl"}

This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 was added, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was removed, and the light stayed on, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was removed, and the light stayed on, suggesting object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was added, and the light stayed on, suggesting object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was removed, and the light stayed on, indicating object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was removed, and the light stayed on, suggesting object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 4 was added, and the light stayed on, suggesting object 4 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was removed, and the light stayed on, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was added again, and the light stayed on, confirming object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was removed, and the light stayed on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was added again, and the light stayed on, suggesting object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was removed, and the light stayed on, confirming object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 2 was added, and the light stayed on, confirming object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turned on when object 5 was added, and it stayed on with object 0. This suggests that objects 5 and 0 are blickets.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine initially, and the light did not turn on. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 553, "prompt_tokens": 1242, "total_tokens": 1795}, "estimated_cost": 0.008635, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-18.jsonl"}
