There is no evidence that object 7 is a blicket, as the light never turned on in its presence.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the state of the machine, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 445, "prompt_tokens": 1240, "total_tokens": 1685}, "estimated_cost": 0.007549999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-39.jsonl"}
