This suggests that object 5 might also be a blicket, or it could be that object 4 alone is sufficient to keep the light on.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was off, and it did not turn the light on. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - There is no evidence from the interactions that object 7, when combined with other objects, turns the light on. The only time the light turned on was when object 4 was placed on the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 7 did not turn the light on when placed on the machine, and there is no evidence of it contributing to turning the light on in combination with other objects, it is reasonable to conclude that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 360, "prompt_tokens": 1238, "total_tokens": 1598}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066949999999999996, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
