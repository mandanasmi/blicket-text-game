This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 4 while object 2 is on the machine keeps the light on, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2's status as a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Placing object 6 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 6 turns the light off, confirming object 6's status as a blicket.\n\n4. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine when the light is already on (with object 2 or 6), so it does not provide new information about its status.\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine without objects 2 or 6, the light remains off, indicating object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on with objects 2 and 6, and not with object 7 alone or in combination with non-blicket objects.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 1243, "total_tokens": 1612}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-23.jsonl"}
