This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 7 to the machine (with objects 0, 2, and 3) keeps the light off. This suggests object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Throughout all interactions, the machine's light never turns on. This indicates that none of the objects tested, including object 7, are blickets, or the rule for activation requires a specific combination that was not tested.\n\nGiven the consistent lack of activation of the machine's light with object 7 on the machine, it is reasonable to conclude that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 463, "prompt_tokens": 1231, "total_tokens": 1694}, "estimated_cost": 0.0077075, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-61.jsonl"}
