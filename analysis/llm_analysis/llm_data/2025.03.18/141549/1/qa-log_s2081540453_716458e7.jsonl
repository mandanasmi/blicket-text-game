This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - After object 3 is placed on the machine and the light is on, other objects (1, 5, 0, 4) are placed on the machine, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light stays on, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light stays on, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was off, and the light did not turn on. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - The light only turned on when object 3 was placed on the machine, and it remained on regardless of other objects being added or removed, as long as object 3 was present.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light did not turn on when object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light only turned on with object 3, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 1228, "total_tokens": 1575}, "estimated_cost": 0.00654, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-25.jsonl"}
