This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 7 is removed while object 0 is still on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 4 is added to the machine with object 0, the light remains on. This suggests object 4 might also be a blicket, but it doesn't affect the status of object 7.\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off, indicating object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 0, and remains on regardless of object 7's presence or absence.\n   - The light does not turn on with object 7 alone.\n   - Therefore, object 7 does not have the property of a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 1231, "total_tokens": 1548}, "estimated_cost": 0.0062475000000000004, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-16.jsonl"}
