This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - After object 3 is removed, the light turns off, confirming that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine while object 3 is on it, the light remains on. However, this does not confirm that object 7 is a blicket, as object 3 is already known to be a blicket.\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine without object 3, the light remains off. This suggests that object 7 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 3 is on the machine. Object 7 does not turn the light on by itself, nor does it contribute to turning the light on when object 3 is absent.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket, as it does not have the property required to activate the machine.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 1236, "total_tokens": 1541}, "estimated_cost": 0.00614, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-1.jsonl"}
