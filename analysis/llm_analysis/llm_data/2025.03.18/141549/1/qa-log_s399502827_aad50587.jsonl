This indicates that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - Object 3 is placed back on the machine without object 5, and the light remains off.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time the machine's light turns on is when object 5 is on the machine. Object 3, whether alone or with other objects (except object 5), does not cause the light to turn on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not activate the machine on its own or contribute to the activation when combined with other non-blicket objects.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1584}, "estimated_cost": 0.006614999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-21.jsonl"}

Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 400, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1630}, "estimated_cost": 0.007075, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-21.jsonl"}
