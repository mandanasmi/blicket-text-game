This strongly suggests that object 7 is a blicket, as it appears to be necessary for the light to turn on initially.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 411, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1641}, "estimated_cost": 0.007185, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
