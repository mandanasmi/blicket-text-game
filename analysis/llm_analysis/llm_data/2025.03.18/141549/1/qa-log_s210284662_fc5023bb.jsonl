This suggests that object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - **Object 6:** When placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 5:** When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This confirms that object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Objects 1, 2, and 6 are confirmed blickets as they consistently cause the machine to turn on when placed on it.\n   - Objects 0, 4, and 5 are not blickets as they do not cause the machine to turn on.\n   - Object 7 has not been tested, but based on the interactions, we cannot infer its status as a blicket without direct evidence.\n\nSince object 7 has not been tested, and there is no indirect evidence from the interactions that can confirm its status, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 373, "prompt_tokens": 1233, "total_tokens": 1606}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068125, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-15.jsonl"}
