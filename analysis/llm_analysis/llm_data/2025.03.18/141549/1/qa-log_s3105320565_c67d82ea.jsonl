This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket, or the combination of these objects is necessary to turn the light on.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - After the light turns on, objects 7 and 6 are removed, but the light remains on. This indicates that neither object 7 nor object 6 is necessary for the light to be on, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Further Analysis:**\n   - The light remains on with objects 2, 3, 4, and 1 on the machine. This further supports the idea that object 2 is likely a blicket, and possibly the only necessary one, as the removal of other objects (like 7 and 6) did not affect the light.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the removal of object 7 did not turn the light off, and the light turned on without object 7 initially, it is reasonable to conclude that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 1231, "total_tokens": 1588}, "estimated_cost": 0.006647500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-49.jsonl"}
