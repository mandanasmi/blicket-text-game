This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Objects 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are on the floor, and the light is off.\n\n2. **Key Interactions:**\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 6 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 4 on the machine while the light is on (with object 6) does not change the state, but removing object 4 does not turn the light off, suggesting object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine while the light is on (with object 6) does not change the state, but removing object 3 does not turn the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 7 on the machine while the light is on (with object 6) does not change the state, but since the light remains on, we cannot conclude object 7 is a blicket based on this interaction alone.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 1 and object 6, indicating they are blickets.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine when the light was already on due to object 6. There is no evidence that object 7 independently causes the light to turn on.\n   - Therefore, based on the interactions, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 1227, "total_tokens": 1642}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072175, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
