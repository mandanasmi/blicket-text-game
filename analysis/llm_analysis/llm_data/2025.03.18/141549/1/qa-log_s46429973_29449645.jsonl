This indicates that object 4 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - After object 4 was placed on the machine, the light stayed on even when objects 1, 2, and 6 were added or removed. This suggests that these objects do not affect the light when object 4 is present.\n   - The light turned off only when object 4 was removed, confirming that object 4 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 was initially placed on the machine with other objects (6, 0, 5, 1), and the light was off. This suggests that object 7 alone or in combination with these objects does not turn the light on.\n   - Object 7 was removed after object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on, indicating that object 7 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light was off when object 7 was on the machine without object 4, and removing object 7 did not affect the light when object 4 was present, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 368, "prompt_tokens": 1229, "total_tokens": 1597}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067525, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-7.jsonl"}
