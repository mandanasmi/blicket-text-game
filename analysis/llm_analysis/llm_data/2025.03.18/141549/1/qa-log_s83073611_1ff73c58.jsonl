This suggests that object 7 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n2. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - Object 5 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 5 was removed, the light turned off, reinforcing that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on, suggesting object 4 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was placed on the machine with object 4, and the light remained on. However, object 1 alone did not turn the light on earlier, so object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on, suggesting object 2 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on, suggesting object 6 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on, suggesting object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on, suggesting object 0 might be a blicket.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was only tested once, and the light did not turn on when it was placed on the machine. There were no subsequent tests with object 7 that resulted in the light turning on.\n   - Since the light did not turn on with object 7 alone, and there is no evidence of the light turning on with object 7 in combination with other objects, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 421, "prompt_tokens": 1229, "total_tokens": 1650}, "estimated_cost": 0.007282500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}
