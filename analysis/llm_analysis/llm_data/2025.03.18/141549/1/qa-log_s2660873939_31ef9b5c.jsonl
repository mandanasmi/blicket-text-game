This suggests that object 4 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 7 is added after object 4, and the light remains on. This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 7 because object 4 is already on the machine.\n   - When object 4 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing the idea that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is on the machine without object 4, and the light is off. This suggests that object 7 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The light turns on again when object 4 is placed back on the machine, regardless of whether object 7 is present or not.\n   - Object 7 is on the machine multiple times without object 4, and the light remains off each time.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 4 is on the machine, and it turns off when object 4 is removed, regardless of the presence of object 7.\n   - Object 7 does not independently cause the light to turn on, indicating that it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 1228, "total_tokens": 1585}, "estimated_cost": 0.00664, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-9.jsonl"}
