This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests object 7 alone is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Objects 6 and 7 are on the machine, and the light is off. This further supports that neither object 6 nor object 7 alone is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added to the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 0, 5, and 4 are added one by one, and the light remains on. This suggests these objects might also be blickets, or object 1 is sufficient to keep the light on.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light stays on, confirming object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light stays on, suggesting object 5 might not be a blicket, or object 1 is sufficient.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 1 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Re-adding Objects:**\n   - Object 7 is re-added, and the light remains off until object 1 is re-added, confirming object 7 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 1 is on the machine, and it turns off when object 1 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects, including object 7.\n   - Object 7 was on the machine multiple times without turning the light on, both alone and with other objects, until object 1 was added.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket because it does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 445, "prompt_tokens": 1229, "total_tokens": 1674}, "estimated_cost": 0.0075225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
