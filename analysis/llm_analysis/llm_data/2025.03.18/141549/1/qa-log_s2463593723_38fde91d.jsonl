This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Objects 4, 5, 6, 3, and 7 are on the machine, and the light is off. This suggests none of these objects are blickets.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light remains off.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light was on initially with objects 0 and 3 on the machine.\n   - Removing object 0 turned the light off, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n   - With object 0 off the machine, adding or removing other objects (including object 7) did not turn the light on, suggesting these objects are not blickets.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light turned off when object 0 was removed and did not turn back on with object 7 on the machine, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the state of the machine's light, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1571}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064849999999999994, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-9.jsonl"}
