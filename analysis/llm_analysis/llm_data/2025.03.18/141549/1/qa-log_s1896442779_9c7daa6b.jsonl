This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 1 being a blicket since object 4 is already on the machine.\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine after the light is already on due to object 4. Therefore, object 7's effect on the machine cannot be determined from this interaction alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turning on is directly associated with object 4 being placed on the machine. There is no evidence that object 7 independently causes the light to turn on.\n   - Since the light was already on when object 7 was placed on the machine, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket based on the given interactions.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions provided, object 7 is not confirmed to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 1227, "total_tokens": 1565}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064475, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
