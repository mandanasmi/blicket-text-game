This suggests object 5 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine multiple times, but the light remains on or off depending on the presence of other objects (like object 6 or 5). There is no evidence that object 7 alone affects the light.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The light turns off only when object 6 is removed, and it turns back on when object 5 is placed on the machine after object 6 is removed. This suggests that objects 6 and 5 are likely blickets.\n   - Object 7 does not seem to have any effect on the light when manipulated, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 328, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1558}, "estimated_cost": 0.0063549999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-60.jsonl"}
