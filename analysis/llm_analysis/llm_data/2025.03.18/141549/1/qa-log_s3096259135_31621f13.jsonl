This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - After removing object 6, the light remained on, indicating object 6 is not a blicket.\n   - After removing object 1, the light turned off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light remained off.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n   - After removing object 3, the light turned off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Specific Observations with Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine multiple times, and each time the light remained off.\n   - Object 7 was removed from the machine, and the light remained off.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 7 does not cause the machine to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects that were tested. Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1562}, "estimated_cost": 0.006395, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-29.jsonl"}
