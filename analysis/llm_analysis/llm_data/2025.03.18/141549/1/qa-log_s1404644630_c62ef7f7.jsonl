This suggests that the presence of other objects (possibly object 7) might interfere with object 0's ability to turn the light on.\n\n7. **Removing Object 7**: After object 7 is removed, the light remains off, which doesn't provide direct evidence of object 7 being a blicket.\n\n8. **Final Analysis**: The only time the light turned on was when object 0 was added to the machine initially. Object 7 was on the machine at that time, but since the light was off when only objects 6 and 7 were on the machine, object 7 alone cannot be a blicket. The light turning on with object 0 suggests that object 0 is the blicket, and object 7 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 420, "prompt_tokens": 1236, "total_tokens": 1656}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072900000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
