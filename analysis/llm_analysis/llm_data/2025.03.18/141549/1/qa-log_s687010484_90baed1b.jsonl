This indicates that object 6 is also a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 3 is placed on the machine while the light is already on, but this does not confirm object 3 as a blicket since the light was already on due to other objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on when placed on the machine. The light only turns on with the presence of objects 6 and 7.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 349, "prompt_tokens": 1233, "total_tokens": 1582}, "estimated_cost": 0.0065725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}

This suggests that none of these objects are blickets when placed alone or together.\n\n3. **Object 7 Interaction:**\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This is the first instance where the light turns on, suggesting object 7 might be a blicket.\n   - After object 7 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing the idea that object 7 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Further Testing with Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on again.\n   - Other objects (0, 2, 3, 6) are added or removed while object 7 is on the machine, and the light remains on, indicating these objects do not affect the light status when object 7 is present.\n   - Finally, when object 6 is removed while object 7 is still on the machine, the light turns off, confirming that object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on only when object 7 is on the machine, and it turns off when object 7 is removed. This consistent behavior strongly indicates that object 7 is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect on the machine's light, object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 404, "prompt_tokens": 1233, "total_tokens": 1637}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}
