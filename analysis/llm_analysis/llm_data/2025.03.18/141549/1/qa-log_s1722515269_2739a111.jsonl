This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is on the machine when the light is off, but when object 0 is added, the light turns on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - After object 0 is placed on the machine, the light remains on regardless of other objects being added or removed, as long as object 0 is present.\n\n3. **Specific Analysis of Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 is placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, but the light remains off until object 0 is added.\n   - When object 7 is removed while object 0 is on the machine, the light remains on, indicating object 7 does not affect the light status.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on only when object 0 is on the machine, and it remains on regardless of the presence of other objects, including object 7.\n   - Object 7 does not independently cause the light to turn on, nor does its removal affect the light when object 0 is present.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 384, "prompt_tokens": 1228, "total_tokens": 1612}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069099999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
