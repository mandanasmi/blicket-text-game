This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - After object 1 was placed on the machine, objects 2 and 6 were also placed on the machine, and the light remained on. This suggests that objects 2 and 6 might also be blickets, or they do not affect the machine's state when object 1 is present.\n   - When object 1 was removed, the light turned off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - Additionally, when object 3 was removed and the light turned off, it further suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, and by extension, object 7 is likely not a blicket either since it behaved similarly to object 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since placing object 7 on the machine did not turn the light on, and it was not involved in any interaction where the light was on, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the state of the machine's light, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 1228, "total_tokens": 1593}, "estimated_cost": 0.006719999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-45.jsonl"}
