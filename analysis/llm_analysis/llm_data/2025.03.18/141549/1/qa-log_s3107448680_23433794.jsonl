This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - When object 6 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off until object 6 is also placed on the machine. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off. Object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1, 2, 5, and 7 are placed on the machine at various times, and the light remains off. This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 6 is on the machine, either alone or with other objects.\n   - Object 7, when placed on the machine, does not cause the light to turn on, either alone or with other objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light does not turn on when object 7 is on the machine, and it only turns on with object 6, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the state of the machine's light, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1588}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066549999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
