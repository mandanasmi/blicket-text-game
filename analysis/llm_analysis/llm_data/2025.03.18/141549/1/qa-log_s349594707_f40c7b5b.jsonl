This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is removed later when the light is on, and the light stays on. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Adding Objects:**\n   - Object 7 is added to the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests object 7 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - Object 6 is added to the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light stays on. This suggests object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 6 is removed, and the light stays on. This suggests there might be another blicket on the machine.\n   - Object 4 is added back, and the light stays on. This does not change the status of object 4 as a non-blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light stays on. This does not provide new information about object 0.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light stays on. This does not provide new information about object 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turned on when object 6 was added, indicating object 6 is a blicket.\n   - The light remained on after object 6 was removed, suggesting there might be another blicket on the machine, but object 7 was already tested alone and did not turn the light on.\n   - Object 7 was on the machine when the light was off and did not cause the light to turn on when added alone.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket because it did not cause the machine to turn on when it was the only new object added, and removing it did not affect the light status when it was on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 470, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1700}, "estimated_cost": 0.007775000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}
