This suggests object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 3 was added, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was added, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 6 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 was added, and the light stayed on. This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Objects 3, 0, 4, and 2 were removed sequentially, and the light stayed on until object 6 was removed, at which point the light turned off. This confirms object 6 is a blicket.\n   - After removing object 6, the light turned off, even though object 0 was still on the machine. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 5:**\n   - Object 5 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 5 might be a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 was on the machine when the light was off and did not contribute to turning it on when other objects were added. \n   - The light turned on with the addition of objects 2, 3, 6, and possibly 5, but not with object 7 alone or in combination with non-blicket objects.\n\nBased on these observations, object 7 does not appear to be a blicket because it did not contribute to turning the machine's light on in any scenario.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 423, "prompt_tokens": 1229, "total_tokens": 1652}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
