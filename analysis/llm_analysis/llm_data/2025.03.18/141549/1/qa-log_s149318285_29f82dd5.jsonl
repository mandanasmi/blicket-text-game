This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was added while the light was on, and the light stayed on. This doesn't confirm if object 4 is a blicket since the light was already on due to object 5.\n   - Removing object 5 turned the light off, reinforcing that object 5 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine alone, and the light remained off. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 was placed again, and the light turned on, confirming object 5's status as a blicket.\n   - Objects 3, 0, and 1 were added while the light was on due to object 5, so their status is unclear.\n   - Removing object 5 turned the light off again, confirming its role as a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was never placed on the machine during any interaction.\n   - The light's behavior was never directly tested with object 7.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 7 was never placed on the machine, we have no evidence to suggest it is a blicket.\n   - The only confirmed blicket is object 5, as it consistently turned the light on when placed on the machine.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket.
