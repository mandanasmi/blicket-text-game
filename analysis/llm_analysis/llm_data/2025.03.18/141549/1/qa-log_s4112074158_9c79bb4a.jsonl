However, since the light turned on with object 0 and remained on with object 0, it is likely that object 0 is the sole blicket.\n\nGiven the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be necessary for the light to be on, and there is no evidence that it independently causes the light to turn on. Therefore, object 3 is likely not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 513, "prompt_tokens": 1226, "total_tokens": 1739}, "estimated_cost": 0.008195000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}

This suggests that neither object 1 nor object 7 alone is a blicket.\n\n2. **Object 0 Interaction:**\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 7 is not necessary for the light to be on, reinforcing that object 7 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 remains on the machine, and the light stays on regardless of other objects being added or removed.\n\n4. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 7 is placed back on the machine, and the light remains on. However, since object 0 is still on the machine, we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket.\n   - Other objects (2, 6, 3, 5) are added and removed, but the light remains on as long as object 0 is on the machine.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 0 and stays on regardless of the presence of object 7. Object 7 does not independently cause the light to turn on, nor does it affect the light when object 0 is present.\n   - Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 1226, "total_tokens": 1591}, "estimated_cost": 0.006715, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}
