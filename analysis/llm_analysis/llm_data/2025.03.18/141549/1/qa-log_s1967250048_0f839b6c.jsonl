This suggests that neither object 3 nor object 5 alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Adding Objects**: \n   - Adding object 6, 2, 1, and 3 to the machine did not turn the light on.\n   - Adding object 0 turned the light on. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects**:\n   - Removing object 2, 3, 5, and 1 did not turn the light off, indicating they are not necessary to keep the light on.\n   - The light remained on when object 0 was on the machine, even when other objects were removed.\n\n4. **Adding Object 7**:\n   - When object 7 was added to the machine, the light was already on due to object 0. \n   - The light remained on when object 7 was added, but this does not provide evidence that object 7 is a blicket because object 0 was already keeping the light on.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The light turned on when object 0 was added, and it stayed on regardless of other objects being added or removed, except for object 0.\n   - Object 7 was added when the light was already on, so we cannot conclude that object 7 is a blicket based on the available information.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 7 is not confirmed to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 1230, "total_tokens": 1576}, "estimated_cost": 0.006535, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-49.jsonl"}
