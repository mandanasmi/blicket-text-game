When object 7 is removed, the light turns off, suggesting object 2 alone does not keep the light on.\n   - Object 7 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on again.\n\n3. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 7 is on the machine, and the light is on. Additional objects (4, 6, 1, 5, 0) are added, and the light remains on.\n   - When object 7 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that none of the other objects alone can keep the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, object 7 consistently turns the machine on when placed on it and turns it off when removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This strongly suggests that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 1229, "total_tokens": 1572}, "estimated_cost": 0.0065025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
