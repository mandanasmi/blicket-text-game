This suggests object 5 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 4 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing that object 5 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Object 2 is added, and the light turns on, suggesting object 2 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 7 Analysis:**\n   - Object 7 is put on the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests object 7 is not a blicket.\n   - There are no interactions where object 7 is on the machine and the light is on, which would indicate it is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when objects 5 or 2 are on the machine, and it turns off when they are removed.\n   - Object 7 does not cause the light to turn on when placed on the machine, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 326, "prompt_tokens": 1229, "total_tokens": 1555}, "estimated_cost": 0.0063325, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/16/action_log_trial-10.jsonl"}
