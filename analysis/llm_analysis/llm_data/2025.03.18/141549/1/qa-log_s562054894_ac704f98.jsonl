This suggests that object 4 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 7 is removed, and the light turns off. This suggests that object 7 might be a blicket because its removal caused the light to turn off.\n\n4. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 7 is added back, and the light turns on again, reinforcing the idea that object 7 is a blicket.\n   - Object 5 is added, and the light remains on, but when object 5 is removed, the light stays on, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 4 is added and stays on until object 7 is removed. This suggests that both objects 4 and 7 are necessary for the light to be on.\n   - The light turns on when object 7 is added back, even without object 4 being added again, confirming that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 7 is a blicket because its presence is necessary for the machine's light to turn on.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 416, "prompt_tokens": 1233, "total_tokens": 1649}, "estimated_cost": 0.007242499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/6/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}
