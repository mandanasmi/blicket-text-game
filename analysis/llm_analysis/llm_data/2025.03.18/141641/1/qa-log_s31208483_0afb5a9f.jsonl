This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n- The machine does not turn on with object 3 and any other combination of objects except when object 0 is present, reinforcing that object 3 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nObject 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on and does not appear to contribute to the machine turning on in combination with other objects, except when object 0 is present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 453, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1658}, "estimated_cost": 0.0075425, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-56.jsonl"}
