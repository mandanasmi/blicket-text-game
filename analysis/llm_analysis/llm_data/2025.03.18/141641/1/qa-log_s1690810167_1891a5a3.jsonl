Again, no new information since object 1 is still on the machine.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. No new information since object 1 is still on the machine.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 1 while other objects are on the machine results in the light staying on until object 3 is removed. This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine results in the light being off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 alone on the machine results in the light being off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, even when other non-blicket objects (0 and 2) are present. This further supports that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on, but removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 when it is the only object on the machine turns the light off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when it is placed on the machine, and the light turns off when it is removed, indicating that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 500, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1705}, "estimated_cost": 0.008012499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
