This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Removing object 3 while other objects are on the machine (e.g., object 1) keeps the light on, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 while other objects are on the machine (e.g., object 3) turns the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on when object 1 is present.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light turns on with object 3 alone, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed and only object 0 or object 2 is left, reinforcing that object 3 contributes to turning the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, turns the light on, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed and only non-blickets (object 0 or object 2) are left, further confirming object 3's status as a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 421, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1626}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-15.jsonl"}
