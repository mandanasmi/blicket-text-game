It neither turns the light on nor keeps it on when other objects are removed.\n   - The light turns on with object 0 or object 2, indicating they are likely blickets.\n   - Object 3 does not exhibit the behavior of a blicket, as it does not influence the machine's state.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 398, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1605}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-38.jsonl"}
