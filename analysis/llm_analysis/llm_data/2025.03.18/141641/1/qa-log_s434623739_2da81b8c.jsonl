This suggests object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Adding objects 0, 2, and 1 again keeps the light off.\n   - Adding object 3 turns the light on. This reinforces that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off again.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - Adding object 1 with object 3 turns the light on, but removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Adding object 3 alone turns the light on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on only when object 3 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects. This consistent behavior indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions and the machine's responses, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 355, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1565}, "estimated_cost": 0.006575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-3.jsonl"}
