This suggests object 3 alone is not a blicket.\n\n14. Object 0 is added, and the light remains off. This confirms object 0 alone is not a blicket.\n\n15. Object 2 is removed, and the light remains off. This confirms object 2 alone is not a blicket.\n\n16. Object 1 is added, and the light remains off. This suggests object 1 alone is not sufficient to turn the light on, but it is necessary.\n\n17. Object 3 is removed, and the light remains off. This confirms object 3 alone is not a blicket.\n\n18. Object 1 is removed, and the light remains off. This confirms object 1 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n19. Object 2 is added, and the light remains off. This confirms object 2 alone is not a blicket.\n\n20. Object 0 is removed, and the light remains off. This confirms object 0 alone is not a blicket.\n\n21. Object 0 is added, and the light remains off. This confirms object 0 alone is not a blicket.\n\n22. Object 2 is removed, and the light remains off. This confirms object 2 alone is not a blicket.\n\n23. Object 3 is added, and the light remains off. This confirms object 3 alone is not a blicket.\n\nFrom the above analysis, object 3 never causes the machine to turn on when it is the only change made. The light only turns on when object 1 is involved, suggesting that object 1 is the key blicket. Object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's state when added or removed, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 745, "prompt_tokens": 1212, "total_tokens": 1957}, "estimated_cost": 0.01048, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-10.jsonl"}
