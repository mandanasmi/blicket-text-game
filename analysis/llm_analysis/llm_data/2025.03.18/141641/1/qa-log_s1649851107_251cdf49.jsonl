This suggests that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine with other objects, but it does not turn on when object 3 is alone. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket by itself.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, so it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 452, "prompt_tokens": 1204, "total_tokens": 1656}, "estimated_cost": 0.00753, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-41.jsonl"}
