This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light remains on, indicating object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 does not affect the light, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine does not change the light status, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Removing object 3 while object 2 is on the machine keeps the light on, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 back on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Consistent Patterns:**\n   - The light turns on with object 3 alone, and it turns off when object 2 is removed, regardless of other objects. This indicates that both object 2 and object 3 are blickets.\n   - Object 0 and object 1 do not independently affect the light, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently causes the light to turn on when placed on the machine, either alone or with other objects. This behavior is consistent with being a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the consistent pattern of the light turning on with object 3, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 373, "prompt_tokens": 1206, "total_tokens": 1579}, "estimated_cost": 0.006745000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-42.jsonl"}
