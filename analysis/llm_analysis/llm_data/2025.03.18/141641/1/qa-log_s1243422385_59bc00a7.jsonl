This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 0, 1, or 2 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on, but we need to see if they can turn it on independently.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - When object 0, 1, and 2 are removed one by one, the light remains on until object 3 is removed, at which point the light turns off. This strongly suggests that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - When object 2 is placed alone, the light remains off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed alone, the light turns on, suggesting object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed back on the machine, the light turns on, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while other objects are on the machine turns the light off, further confirming object 3's status as a blicket.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The light turns on with object 1 alone, suggesting object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 0 does not seem to affect the light independently, as removing it does not turn the light off when object 3 is present.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently causes the light to turn on or remain on when it is on the machine, and the light turns off when it is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This behavior confirms that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 422, "prompt_tokens": 1204, "total_tokens": 1626}, "estimated_cost": 0.00723, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-5.jsonl"}
