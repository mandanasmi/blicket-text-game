This strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the necessity of object 3 to keep the machine on, we conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1608}, "estimated_cost": 0.007042499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-12.jsonl"}
