This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light remains on, indicating that object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light remains on, suggesting object 0 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 and object 0 while object 3 is still on the machine keeps the light on, reinforcing that object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, which strongly indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 after object 3 is removed keeps the light off, confirming object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine with object 0 keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine with object 0 and object 2 keeps the light on, reinforcing that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine keeps the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket by itself.\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine with object 0 keeps the light on, reinforcing that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when it is placed on the machine, and the machine turns off when object 3 is removed. This strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 505, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1710}, "estimated_cost": 0.0080625, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-3.jsonl"}
