This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 is not solely responsible for the light.\n   - Removing object 0 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is not solely responsible for the light.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating object 1 is a necessary blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine results in the light being off, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 alone on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 alone on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine does not turn the light on, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket because removing it turns the light off.\n   - Object 0 is confirmed to be a blicket because placing it alone turns the light on.\n   - Object 3, when placed alone, does not turn the light on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 468, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1673}, "estimated_cost": 0.0076925, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-21.jsonl"}
