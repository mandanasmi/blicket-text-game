The presence or absence of object 3 does not affect the light when object 2 is not on the machine.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 439, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1649}, "estimated_cost": 0.007415, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-29.jsonl"}
