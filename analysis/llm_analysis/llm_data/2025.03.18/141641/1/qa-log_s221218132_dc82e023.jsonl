This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2, 3, and 0 each have instances where their removal turns the machine off, indicating they are blickets.\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, turns the machine on. This is a strong indication that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - The removal of object 3 from a combination that turns the machine on results in the machine turning off, further confirming that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the above analysis, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1563}, "estimated_cost": 0.006592499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-61.jsonl"}
