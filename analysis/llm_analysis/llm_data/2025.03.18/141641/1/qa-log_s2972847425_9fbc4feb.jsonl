This suggests object 1 might be a blicket, but further evidence is needed.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3 while the light is on does not turn the light off. This suggests object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 does not turn the light off, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine when the light is off does not turn the light on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine when the light is off does not turn the light on, confirming object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times when the light was off, and it never turned the light on. This strongly suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - The light only turns on with objects 0 and 2, indicating they are the blickets.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 468, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1673}, "estimated_cost": 0.0076925, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
