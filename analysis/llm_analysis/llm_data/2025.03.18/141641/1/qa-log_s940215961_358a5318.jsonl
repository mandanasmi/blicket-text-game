This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is added, the light remains on. This does not provide new information about object 0 since the light was already on.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 0 keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, strongly indicating that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 and object 2 after this point keeps the light off, suggesting neither are blickets.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 1 and object 0 on the machine keeps the light off.\n   - Adding object 3 again keeps the light off, but adding object 2 turns the light on. This suggests that object 2 might also be a blicket, but it doesn't affect the status of object 3.\n   - Removing object 1 and object 0 keeps the light on, reinforcing that they are not blickets.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, suggesting object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 after this point keeps the light off, confirming object 3's role as a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Tests:**\n   - Placing object 0, object 1, and object 2 on the machine keeps the light off.\n   - Adding object 3 turns the light on, confirming that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nThroughout these interactions, object 3 consistently causes the light to turn on when it is placed on the machine, and the light turns off when it is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 485, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1690}, "estimated_cost": 0.0078625, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-17.jsonl"}
