The machine turns on when object 3 is combined with certain other objects (specifically object 0 or object 2), but not with object 1. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket on its own, as it does not activate the machine independently.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 416, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1623}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071775, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
