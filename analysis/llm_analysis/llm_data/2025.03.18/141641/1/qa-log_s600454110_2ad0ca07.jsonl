This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 0, 1, or 2 is placed on the machine individually, the light does not turn on. This suggests that these objects are not blickets on their own.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine, adding or removing other objects (0, 1, 2) does not affect the light being on, reinforcing that object 3 is the key to turning the light on.\n\n3. **Testing Combinations:**\n   - When object 3 is on the machine, the light is on regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - When object 3 is off the machine, the light is off, even if other objects are on the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The consistent pattern is that the light is on whenever object 3 is on the machine, and off when it is not. This strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket, as it alone can turn the machine on.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1515}, "estimated_cost": 0.0061125, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-8.jsonl"}
