This doesn't confirm object 3 as a blicket because object 1 is already known to be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine without object 1, the light is off. This indicates that object 3 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on with object 1 alone, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - The machine does not turn on with object 3 alone, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1590}, "estimated_cost": 0.006862499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-10.jsonl"}
