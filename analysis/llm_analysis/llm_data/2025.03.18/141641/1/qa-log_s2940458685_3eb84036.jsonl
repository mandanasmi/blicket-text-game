This suggests that object 0 might also be a blicket, but it requires object 3 to be present to turn the light on.\n   - Object 2 does not seem to affect the light when added or removed, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine, either alone or in combination with other objects. This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 364, "prompt_tokens": 1204, "total_tokens": 1568}, "estimated_cost": 0.00665, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
