This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is removed, the light turns off, confirming object 2 is necessary to keep the light on.\n\n2. **Subsequent Observations:**\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, confirming object 0 is necessary to keep the light on.\n\n3. **Object 3 Analysis:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on if object 2 or object 0 is also on the machine.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light remains on if object 2 or object 0 is still on the machine.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine without object 2 or object 0, the light does not turn on.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light does not turn off if object 2 or object 0 is still on the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on.\n   - The light only turns on with object 2 or object 0, indicating they are the blickets.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the light when added or removed, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 356, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1561}, "estimated_cost": 0.006572499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-41.jsonl"}
