This suggests object 3 might be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 2 might be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 0 might be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3 does not turn off the light, suggesting object 3 alone is not responsible for the light being on.\n   - Removing object 0 does not turn off the light, suggesting object 0 alone is not responsible for the light being on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns off the light, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns off the light, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 0 alone on the machine does not turn on the light, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine turns on the light, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns off the light, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 and object 2 are confirmed blickets because their removal turns off the light.\n   - Object 3 is confirmed a blicket because placing it alone on the machine turns on the light, and removing it turns off the light.\n   - Object 0 is not a blicket because placing it alone on the machine does not turn on the light.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 443, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1648}, "estimated_cost": 0.0074424999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}
