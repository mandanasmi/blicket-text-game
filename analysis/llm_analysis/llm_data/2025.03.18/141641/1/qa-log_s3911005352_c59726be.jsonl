This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n- Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, does not turn the light on. This indicates that object 3 is not a blicket.\n- The presence or absence of object 3 does not affect the light when object 0 is on the machine, further supporting that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 1654}, "estimated_cost": 0.0074800000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
