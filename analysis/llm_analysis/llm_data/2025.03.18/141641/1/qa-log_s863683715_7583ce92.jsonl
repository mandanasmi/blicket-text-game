This suggests that neither object 3, 1, nor 2 are blickets.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine with object 0, and then object 0 is removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent factor for the light turning on is the presence of object 0. Object 3, when tested alone or with other non-blicket objects (1 and 2), does not turn the light on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 400, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1607}, "estimated_cost": 0.007017499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
