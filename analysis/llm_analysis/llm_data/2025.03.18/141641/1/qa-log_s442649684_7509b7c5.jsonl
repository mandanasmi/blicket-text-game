The light remains off when object 3 is placed on the machine alone or with object 1, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on in any scenario where it is placed on the machine alone or with non-blicket objects. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 576, "prompt_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 1784}, "estimated_cost": 0.00878, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-44.jsonl"}
