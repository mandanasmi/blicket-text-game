This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on.\n   - Removing object 1 does not turn the light off, indicating object 1 alone is not responsible for the light being on.\n   - Removing object 0 does not turn the light off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, strongly suggesting that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. **Repeated Tests:**\n   - The sequence of adding objects 0, 2, and 3 is repeated, and the light turns on only when object 3 is added.\n   - Removing object 3 again turns the light off, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - Adding object 1 after object 3 does not change the light status, and removing object 1 does not turn the light off, indicating object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - The light turns off only when object 3 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The consistent pattern is that the light turns on when object 3 is on the machine and turns off when object 3 is removed. This strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 1204, "total_tokens": 1590}, "estimated_cost": 0.00687, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-17.jsonl"}
