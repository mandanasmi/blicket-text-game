This suggests object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 3 since the light was already on.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 also keeps the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 0 again turns the light on, but this is in the presence of object 1, which we suspect is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Removing object 3 while object 0 is on keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 alone turns the light on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 0 alone does not turn the light on, confirming object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine alone or with non-blicket objects, does not turn the light on.\n   - Object 1 consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine, confirming it as a blicket.\n   - Object 0 and object 2 do not turn the light on when placed alone, confirming they are not blickets.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on when placed alone or with other non-blicket objects. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1656}, "estimated_cost": 0.007485, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-51.jsonl"}
