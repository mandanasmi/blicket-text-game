This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light remains on.\n   - Removing object 0 keeps the light on, indicating object 0 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 1 keeps the light on, indicating object 1 is not necessary.\n   - Removing object 2 keeps the light on, indicating object 2 is not necessary.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, strongly suggesting object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Additional Tests:**\n   - Placing object 1 and object 0 together turns the light on, but when object 3 is removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 3 is crucial for the light to be on.\n   - Placing object 3 alone turns the light on, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 consistently turns the light off, regardless of other objects present.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine and turns off when it is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This consistent behavior indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1567}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066324999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-60.jsonl"}
