This suggests that these objects alone are not blickets.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - When object 3 is removed from the machine, the light turns off, even if other objects are on the machine. This strongly indicates that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed back on the machine, the light turns on again, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Additional Tests:**\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine with object 3, the light remains on even after removing object 3. This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket, but it does not affect the status of object 3.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off unless object 1 is present, which suggests that object 1 can also keep the light on, but object 3 is independently capable of turning the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine and turns it off when removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This behavior is characteristic of a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the consistent effect of object 3 on the machine, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 373, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1578}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067425, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-44.jsonl"}
