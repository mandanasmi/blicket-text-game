However, when object 0 is removed and object 2 remains, the light stays on, indicating object 0 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - The critical test is when object 0 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on, and when removed, the light turns off.

This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine turns the light on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine keeps the light off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The light turns off when object 2 is removed, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 0 is removed, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine with other objects does not affect the light when the light is already on, but placing it alone keeps the light off.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 3, when placed alone on the machine, does not turn the light on. This indicates that object 3 is not a blicket. The machine turns on with object 2 or object 0, but not with object 3 alone.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 491, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1696}, "estimated_cost": 0.007922499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-58.jsonl"}
