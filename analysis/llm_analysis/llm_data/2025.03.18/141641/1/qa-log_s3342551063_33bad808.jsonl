This suggests object 2 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 0, 2, or 3 while object 1 is still on the machine keeps the light on. This reinforces that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 after object 1 is removed also turns the light off, but this is because object 1 was the only confirmed blicket at that point.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine alone turns the light on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns on with object 0 alone, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - The light does not turn on with object 2 or 3 alone, suggesting neither is a blicket.\n   - The light turns on with object 1 alone, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1641}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-24.jsonl"}
