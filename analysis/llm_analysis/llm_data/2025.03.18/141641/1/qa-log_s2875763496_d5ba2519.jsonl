This is inconsistent with the previous observation and suggests that object 3 alone might not be a blicket.\n\n3. **Combination Testing:**\n   - When object 0 and 3 are on the machine together, the light turns on. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, and object 3 might not be necessary for the light to turn on.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine without object 0, the light remains off, further suggesting that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 0, and not with object 3 alone. Object 3 does not consistently cause the light to turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1545}, "estimated_cost": 0.0063974999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-31.jsonl"}
