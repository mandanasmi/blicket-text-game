The machine turns on when either object 0 or object 1 is present, indicating they are blickets. Object 3 does not have this effect, so it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 429, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1634}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}
