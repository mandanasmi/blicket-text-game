This suggests that object 0 might also be a blicket, but it doesn't confirm anything about object 3.\n   - When object 2 is added, the light remains on, suggesting object 2 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3 while the light is on (with other objects present) does not turn the light off. This suggests object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on, reinforcing that object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 and object 1 while the light is on (with other objects present) does not turn the light off, but removing object 2 turns the light off. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine with object 0 results in the light being off, suggesting neither object 3 nor object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine with object 3 turns the light on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns off when object 2 is removed, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 1 is removed, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on, nor does its removal affect the light when other blickets are present.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because it does not independently cause the machine to turn on, nor is it necessary for the machine to remain on when other objects are present.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 499, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1704}, "estimated_cost": 0.0080025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-19.jsonl"}
