This confirms that object 2 is necessary for the light to be on, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine without object 2, the light remains off, indicating that object 1 alone is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing with Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, but the light never turns on when object 3 is involved without object 2.\n   - Specifically, when object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2, the light remains off until object 1 is added. This suggests that object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on in any scenario, either alone or in combination with other objects, unless object 2 and object 1 are involved. This indicates that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1591}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
