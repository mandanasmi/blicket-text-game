This suggests that object 2 might not be a blicket on its own but could be part of a combination rule with object 1.\n   - Object 3, when added to any combination, does not affect the light status unless object 1 is present. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket as it consistently turns the machine on.\n   - Object 2 might be a blicket in combination with object 1, but not on its own.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the machine on in any scenario, either alone or in combination, unless object 1 is present. This indicates that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 404, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1609}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070525, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-49.jsonl"}
