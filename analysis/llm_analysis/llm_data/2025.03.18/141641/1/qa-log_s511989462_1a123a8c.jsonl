This suggests object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting other objects might be blickets.\n   - Removing object 1 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting other objects might be blickets.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 after object 0 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 might not be a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 alone on the machine keeps the light off, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 alone on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with other objects, the light turns on only if object 2 or object 0 is present, indicating object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, and the light only turns on when other confirmed blickets (object 2 or object 0) are present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 473, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1678}, "estimated_cost": 0.007742499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
