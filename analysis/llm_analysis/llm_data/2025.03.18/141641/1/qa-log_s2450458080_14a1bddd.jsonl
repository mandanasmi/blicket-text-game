This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket, or it works in combination with another object to turn the light on.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, further suggesting that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 2 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on, indicating that object 2 might also be a blicket or works in combination with object 3.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is crucial for the light to be on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is on the machine, either alone or in combination with other objects. Removing object 3 consistently turns the light off.\n   - This pattern strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket, as it appears to be necessary for the machine to turn on.\n\nBased on the interactions and the resulting states of the machine, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 372, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1579}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067374999999999996, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
