This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 keeps the light on, but since object 1 is already on, we can't conclude anything about object 3 yet.\n   - Adding object 0 keeps the light on, but again, object 1 is still on the machine.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 (while 1, 3, and 0 are on) keeps the light on.\n   - Removing object 3 (while 1 and 0 are on) keeps the light on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 (while 1 is off) keeps the light off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 1 alone turns the light on, confirming it as a blicket.\n   - Adding object 0 keeps the light on, but object 1 is already on.\n   - Adding object 2 keeps the light on, but object 1 is still on.\n   - Adding object 3 keeps the light on, but object 1 is still on.\n\n4. **Removing Objects Again:**\n   - Removing object 2 (while 1, 0, and 3 are on) keeps the light on.\n   - Removing object 0 (while 1 and 3 are on) keeps the light on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 alone turns the light on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone turns the light on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 keeps the light on, but object 3 is already on.\n   - Adding object 2 keeps the light on, but object 3 is still on.\n   - Adding object 0 keeps the light on, but object 3 is still on.\n   - Removing object 3 (while 1, 2, and 0 are on) turns the light off, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can turn the machine on by itself.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 561, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1766}, "estimated_cost": 0.008622499999999998, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}
