This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 does not affect the light when object 1 is on the machine, suggesting object 0 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Adding object 3 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on, but this doesn't confirm if object 3 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - When object 1 is removed, the light remains on if object 3 is on the machine. This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, confirming that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on when object 1 is not present.\n   - Object 2 does not turn the light on by itself, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed, even if other objects are present, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine, even if object 1 is not present, further confirming object 3's status as a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 is a blicket because the light turns off when it is removed and turns on when it is placed on the machine, independent of other objects.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 339, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1546}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064075, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-0.jsonl"}
