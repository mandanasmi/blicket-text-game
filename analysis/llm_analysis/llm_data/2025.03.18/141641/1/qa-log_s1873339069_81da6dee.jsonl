However, when object 3 is alone, the light is off. This suggests that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2, the light is off. This suggests that object 2 does not activate the machine either.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the machine on, as seen in multiple instances where the light remains off when only object 3 is on the machine.\n   - The light turns on when object 0 or object 1 is on the machine, regardless of whether object 3 is present or not. This indicates that object 0 and object 1 are likely blickets, and object 3 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 3 alone does not activate the machine, and the presence of object 3 does not affect the machine's state when other objects are present, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the state of the machine's light, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 1598}, "estimated_cost": 0.00692, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
