This suggests neither object 1 nor object 0 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 after object 2 is already removed keeps the light off. This doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Repeating the process with different combinations consistently shows that removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming its status as a blicket.\n   - In all scenarios, the light turns off only when object 2 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 2 is the only object that consistently causes the light to turn on and off when placed or removed. This indicates that object 2 is the sole blicket.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine without object 2, does not turn the light on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1612}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070825, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-43.jsonl"}
