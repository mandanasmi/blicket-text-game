This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on if object 2 is already there, but when object 3 is alone, the light is off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Analysis:**\n   - The light turns off when object 1 is removed, indicating that object 1 is not a blicket, as the light was dependent on object 2.\n   - The light turns off when object 2 is removed, confirming that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed, but only if object 2 is not present. This further supports that object 3 is not a blicket, as the light's state is dependent on object 2.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 2 is the only object that consistently causes the light to turn on when placed on the machine, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - Objects 0, 1, and 3 do not cause the light to turn on when placed alone on the machine, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 405, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1610}, "estimated_cost": 0.007062499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
