This suggests object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is added to the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 while object 1 is still on the machine turns the light off, suggesting object 2 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is added to the machine with object 1, the light turns on, but removing object 0 turns the light off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is added to the machine with object 1, the light remains on, but removing object 3 does not affect the light, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Testing:**\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off.\n   - When object 1 is added to the machine with object 2, the light remains off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is added to the machine with object 1 and object 2, the light turns on, but removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is added to the machine with object 1 and object 2, the light remains on, but removing object 3 does not affect the light, confirming object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket because it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.\n- Object 2 does not turn the light on by itself, and its presence does not affect the light when object 1 is on the machine.\n- Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, and its presence does not affect the light when object 1 is on the machine.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 582, "prompt_tokens": 1204, "total_tokens": 1786}, "estimated_cost": 0.008830000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-4.jsonl"}
