This suggests object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is added, the light remains on. This suggests object 1 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 does not affect the light; it stays on.\n   - Removing object 0, the light stays on, indicating object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 when the light is off does not change the state, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 1 alone turns the light on, confirming it is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 with object 1 keeps the light on, but object 2 alone does not turn it on, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 with object 1 keeps the light on, but object 3 alone does not turn it on, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 with object 1 keeps the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 alone never turns the light on.\n   - The light turns on with object 1 alone, and stays on with combinations including object 1.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the light when added or removed if object 1 is not present.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, nor does it seem to contribute to the machine being on when combined with other objects. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 1204, "total_tokens": 1650}, "estimated_cost": 0.007470000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-52.jsonl"}
