This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light stays on. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light stays on. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added back, and the light stays on. This confirms object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light stays on. This suggests another object is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 2 is added back, and the light turns on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light stays on. This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light stays on. This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light stays on. This confirms object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light stays on. This confirms object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. This strongly suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light turns on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is added, and the light stays on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light stays on. This doesn't provide new information about object 0.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light stays on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light stays on. This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light stays on. This confirms object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nThroughout these interactions, the key observations are:\n- The light turns off when object 3 is removed while other objects are on the machine, indicating object 3 is necessary to keep the light on.\n- The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine, even when other objects are not blickets.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 660, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1867}, "estimated_cost": 0.0096175, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-50.jsonl"}
