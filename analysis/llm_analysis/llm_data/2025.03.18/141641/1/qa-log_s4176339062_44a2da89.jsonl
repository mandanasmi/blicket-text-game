The machine's state is unaffected by the presence or absence of object 3.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 464, "prompt_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 1672}, "estimated_cost": 0.00766, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-18.jsonl"}
