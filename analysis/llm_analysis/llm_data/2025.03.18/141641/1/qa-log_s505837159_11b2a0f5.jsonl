This suggests object 2 might be a blicket under certain conditions.\n   - Removing object 3 when object 2 is on the machine does not affect the light, indicating object 3 is not contributing to the light being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket because it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - Object 2 turns the light on only in the absence of object 1, suggesting it might be a blicket under specific conditions.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on when placed alone and does not affect the light when removed, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 432, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1639}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073375, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-27.jsonl"}
