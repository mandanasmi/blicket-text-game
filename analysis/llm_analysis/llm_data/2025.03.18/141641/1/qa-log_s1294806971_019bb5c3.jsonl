This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2, 3, and 0 sequentially does not turn off the light, indicating that none of these objects are solely responsible for keeping the light on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns off the light, confirming that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - The sequence of placing and removing objects is repeated multiple times, consistently showing that removing object 1 turns off the light, while removing other objects does not affect the light if object 1 is still on the machine.\n   - In one instance, removing object 2 turns off the light, but this only happens when object 1 is already removed, suggesting object 2 might also be a blicket, but it is not conclusive.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns off only when object 1 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This strongly indicates that object 1 is the primary blicket.\n   - Object 3 is never shown to be necessary for the light to be on, as the light remains on or off based on the presence of object 1.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because the light's state is not dependent on its presence. The light turns off only when object 1 is removed, indicating that object 1 is the key blicket. Object 3 does not independently affect the light's state.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 471, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1676}, "estimated_cost": 0.007722499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-14.jsonl"}
