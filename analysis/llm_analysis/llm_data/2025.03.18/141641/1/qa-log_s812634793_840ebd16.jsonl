This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket by itself but may be part of a combination that turns the light on.\n   - Object 0, when placed on the machine, turns the light on, indicating it is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 2, when placed on the machine, turns the light on, indicating it is likely a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, and thus, it is not a blicket. The light turns on when object 3 is combined with other objects, but this does not make it a blicket on its own.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 481, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1686}, "estimated_cost": 0.0078225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-0.jsonl"}
