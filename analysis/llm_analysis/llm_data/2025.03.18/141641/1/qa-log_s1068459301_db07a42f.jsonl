This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 1 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 while object 0 is still on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 and object 3 after object 0 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting neither object 1 nor object 3 alone can turn the light on.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 0 back on the machine turns the light on again, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 while other objects are on the machine turns the light off, reinforcing that object 0 is necessary to keep the light on.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, suggesting object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 and object 1 after object 2 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting neither object 1 nor object 3 alone can turn the light on.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns off when object 0 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 2 is removed, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not independently affect the light when object 0 or object 2 is removed, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on or keep it on when other confirmed blickets (object 0 and object 2) are removed. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 507, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1712}, "estimated_cost": 0.0080825, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-56.jsonl"}
