The light turns off when object 3 is removed, indicating that object 3 has a direct effect on the machine's state.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 505, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1762}, "estimated_cost": 0.008192500000000002, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
