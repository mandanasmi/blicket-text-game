However, since object 1 alone can turn the light on, this does not provide evidence that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine without object 1, the light remains off. This suggests that object 3 does not have the ability to turn the light on by itself.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 1 is on the machine, either alone or with other objects. Object 3 does not affect the light when object 1 is absent.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have any independent effect on the machine's light and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1610}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066725000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-16.jsonl"}
