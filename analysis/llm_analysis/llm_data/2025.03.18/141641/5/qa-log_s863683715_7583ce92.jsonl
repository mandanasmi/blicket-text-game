This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is on the machine alone, the light is off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Combinations:**\n   - When object 0 and object 3 are on the machine together, the light turns on. Since object 0 alone can turn the light on, object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n   - When object 0, object 1, and object 3 are on the machine, the light is on. Again, object 0 is the likely cause.\n   - When object 0, object 1, object 2, and object 3 are on the machine, the light is on. Object 0 is likely the cause.\n   - When object 3, object 1, and object 2 are on the machine without object 0, the light is off. This suggests none of these objects are blickets.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Removing object 0 while object 3 is on the machine turns the light off, reinforcing that object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 to the machine when object 0 is not present does not turn the light on, further indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, nor does it contribute to turning the machine on when combined with other non-blicket objects. The only consistent factor for the machine turning on is the presence of object 0.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 450, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1709}, "estimated_cost": 0.0076475, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
