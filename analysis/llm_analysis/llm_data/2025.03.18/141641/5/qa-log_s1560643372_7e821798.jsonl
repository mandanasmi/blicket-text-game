The machine's light turns on only when object 1 is present, indicating that object 1 is likely a blicket.\n   - Since object 3 does not influence the machine's state, it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 816, "prompt_tokens": 1264, "total_tokens": 2080}, "estimated_cost": 0.01132, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-10.jsonl"}
