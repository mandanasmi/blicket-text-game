However, this does not necessarily mean object 3 is a blicket, as object 0 is already known to turn the light on.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2, the light remains on. Again, object 2 is already known to turn the light on.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone or with object 1, the light remains off. This suggests object 3 does not independently turn the light on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light never turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine alone or with non-blicket objects. The light only turns on when object 3 is placed with known blickets (object 0 or object 2), which are already capable of turning the light on by themselves.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have any independent effect on the machine's light and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1631}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068825, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-7.jsonl"}
