Since object 3 does not affect the machine's state independently or in combination with other objects (except when object 0 is present, which seems to be the key object), object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 361, "prompt_tokens": 1256, "total_tokens": 1617}, "estimated_cost": 0.00675, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-4.jsonl"}
