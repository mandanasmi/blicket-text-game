This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing with Object 0:**\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light turns on. However, when object 0 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 0 might be a blicket when combined with object 1.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine alone or with other objects (except object 1), does not cause the light to turn on.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the light when object 1 is on the machine, as the light remains on or off depending on object 1's presence.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's light, either alone or in combination with other objects. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1672}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072925, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-8.jsonl"}
