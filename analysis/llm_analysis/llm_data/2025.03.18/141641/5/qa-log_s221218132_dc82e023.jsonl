The light turns on or off based on the presence of objects 1 and 2, not object 3.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's state. The machine's state changes are dependent on objects 1 and 2, indicating that they are likely the blickets. Object 3 does not meet the criteria of a blicket, as its presence or absence does not correlate with the machine's state.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 465, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1722}, "estimated_cost": 0.007792500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-61.jsonl"}
