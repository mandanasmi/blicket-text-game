This further suggests that object 3 alone or with object 0 is not sufficient to turn on the machine.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine with object 2, the light turned on. This indicates that object 2 is likely a blicket, as it consistently turns the light on when present.\n\n3. **Further Analysis:**\n   - Object 2 seems to be the key to turning the light on, as it consistently does so when placed on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, nor does it contribute to turning the light on when combined with objects other than object 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not have any independent effect on the machine's light. The light only turns on when object 2 is present, indicating that object 2 is the blicket.\n   - Since object 3 does not affect the machine's state independently, it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1642}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069925000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-0.jsonl"}
