Since object 3 does not affect the machine's state (the light remains off when object 3 is on the machine without object 0), object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the definition of a blicket, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1615}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-9.jsonl"}
