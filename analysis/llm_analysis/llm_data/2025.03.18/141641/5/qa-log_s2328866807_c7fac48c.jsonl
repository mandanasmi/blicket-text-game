The light remains off when object 3 is added or removed, unless object 0 and 2 are involved.\n- The machine's state changes are consistent with object 0 and object 2 being the blickets, as they are the ones that consistently cause the machine to turn on when used together.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nObject 3 does not influence the machine's state and does not appear to be a blicket. The machine's state changes are independent of object 3's presence.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 626, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1883}, "estimated_cost": 0.009402500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}
