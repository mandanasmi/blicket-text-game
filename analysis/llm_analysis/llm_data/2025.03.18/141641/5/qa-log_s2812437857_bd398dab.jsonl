Removing object 1 turns the light off.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light remains off unless object 1 is also on the machine.\n\n3. **Combinations Involving Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0, the light is on. However, object 0 alone can turn the light on, so object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on in this scenario.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light is on. However, object 1 alone can turn the light on, so object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on in this scenario.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2, the light remains off, indicating that object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently or in combination with other objects (except those that can already turn the light on by themselves) cause the machine's light to turn on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's state and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 388, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1647}, "estimated_cost": 0.007027499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-21.jsonl"}
