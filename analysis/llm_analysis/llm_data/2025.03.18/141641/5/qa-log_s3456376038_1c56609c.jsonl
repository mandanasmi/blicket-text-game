This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, confirming that object 0 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - When object 0 is on the machine with other objects, the light is on, but when object 0 is removed, the light turns off, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n3. **Specific Observations with Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is on the machine with object 0, the light is on.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine without object 0, the light is off.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 0 is on the machine does not affect the light being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light's state is dependent on the presence of object 0. The presence or absence of object 3 does not affect the light's state when object 0 is not on the machine.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's light and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1609}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066475, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-13.jsonl"}
