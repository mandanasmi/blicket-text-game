This suggests object 0 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 turned the light off, indicating object 2 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 and object 0 also turned the light off, but since the light was already off after removing object 2, this doesn't provide new information.\n   - Removing object 3 when the light was off didn't change the state.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 1 and object 0 together kept the light off.\n   - Adding object 2 turned the light on, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 kept the light on, but since the light was already on, this doesn't confirm object 3 as a blicket.\n\n4. **Removing Objects Again:**\n   - Removing object 0 turned the light off, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 and object 2 when the light was off didn't change the state.\n   - Placing object 2 alone kept the light off, suggesting object 2 alone isn't sufficient to turn the light on.\n\n5. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 0 turned the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 kept the light on, but since object 0 was already on, this doesn't confirm object 1 as a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 kept the light on, but again, object 0 was already on.\n   - Removing object 3 when the light was on didn't change the state, suggesting object 3 isn't necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turned the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 0 is confirmed to be a blicket because its presence consistently turns the light on.\n- Object 2 might be a blicket because its presence with object 0 turns the light on, but it doesn't turn the light on by itself.\n- Object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because its presence or absence does not independently affect the light's state. The light turns on and off without any clear dependency on object 3.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 581, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1838}, "estimated_cost": 0.0089525, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-29.jsonl"}
