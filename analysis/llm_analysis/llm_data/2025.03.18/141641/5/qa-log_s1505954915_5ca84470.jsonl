Initially, it does not turn the light on, but later it does. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket, but its effect is conditional or depends on the presence of other objects.\n   - Given the final interaction where placing object 3 on the machine turns the light on, it suggests that object 3 has a non-zero mutual information with the machine's state, indicating it is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the final interaction where object 3 alone turns the machine on, we conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 424, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1683}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073875, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
