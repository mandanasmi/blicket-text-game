Removing objects 0, 1, and 2 one by one does not turn the light off, but removing object 3 turns the light off.\n   - This suggests that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, indicating it has a special property (blicktness).\n\n3. **Further Confirmation:**\n   - In multiple sequences, placing object 3 on the machine turns the light on, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Removing object 3 consistently turns the light off, even if other objects are present.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The consistent pattern is that the light turns on when object 3 is on the machine and turns off when it is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket, as its presence directly correlates with the machine's state (on/off).\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1556}, "estimated_cost": 0.006132500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-25.jsonl"}
