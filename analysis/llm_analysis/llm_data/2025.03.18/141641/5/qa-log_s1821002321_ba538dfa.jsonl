This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - When objects 1 and 2 are on the machine, the light is on. Removing object 2 turns the light off, indicating object 2 is necessary for the light to be on in this combination.\n   - When objects 1, 2, and 3 are on the machine, the light is on. Removing object 3 does not turn the light off, indicating object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Further Analysis:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and in combination with other objects, but it never causes the light to turn on by itself or in any combination where the light was previously off.\n   - The light turns on when object 1 is added to a combination that includes object 2, regardless of object 3's presence.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 alone or with object 1 in combination with object 2. Object 3 does not independently or necessarily contribute to the light turning on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of a blicket, as its presence does not affect the state of the machine's light.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 1256, "total_tokens": 1663}, "estimated_cost": 0.007210000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-47.jsonl"}
