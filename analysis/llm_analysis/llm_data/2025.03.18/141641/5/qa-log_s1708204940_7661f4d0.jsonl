This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing Object 3**: \n   - When object 3 is removed while object 2 is on the machine, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 3 might not be a blicket because the machine was on due to object 2, and removing object 3 did not affect the machine's state.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine without object 2, the machine remains off. This further suggests that object 3 is not a blicket because it does not turn the machine on by itself.\n\n3. **Further Tests**:\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the machine turns on, regardless of whether object 3 is present or not. This indicates that object 2 is the key to turning the machine on, not object 3.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times without object 2, and the machine remains off each time.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The machine only turns on when object 2 is on it, regardless of the presence of object 3. Object 3 does not independently affect the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness, as it does not influence the machine's state.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 1262, "total_tokens": 1616}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066949999999999996, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-34.jsonl"}
