However, when object 0 is removed, the light turns off, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light turns on. However, when object 1 is removed, the light turns off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2, the light remains off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light is off, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 0 or object 1 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of object 3. This suggests that object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n   - The light does not turn on when object 3 is placed on the machine alone, which further supports that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's light turning on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 1260, "total_tokens": 1611}, "estimated_cost": 0.00666, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
