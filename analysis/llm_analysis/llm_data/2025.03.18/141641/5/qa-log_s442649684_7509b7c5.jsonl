This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is removed from the machine, the light turns off, indicating object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light remains off, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Interactions Involving Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0, the light remains on. However, object 0 is already known to be a blicket, so this doesn't provide information about object 3.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light remains off. Since object 1 is not a blicket, this further suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed from the machine, the light remains off, which is consistent with object 3 not being a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine only turns on when object 0 or object 2 is on the machine. Object 3, when placed on the machine alone or with non-blicket objects, does not turn the machine on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 1260, "total_tokens": 1629}, "estimated_cost": 0.006840000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-44.jsonl"}
