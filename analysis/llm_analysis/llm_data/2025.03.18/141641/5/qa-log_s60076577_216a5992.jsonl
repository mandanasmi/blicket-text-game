This indicates that object 3 contributes to keeping the light on when object 0 is not present.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with other objects (1 and 2) and without object 0, the light remains off. This suggests that object 3 alone or with non-blicket objects does not turn the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently turn the machine on, nor does it keep the machine on when object 0 is removed. The light only turns on when object 0 is present, and object 3 does not affect the light when object 0 is absent.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of a blicket, as it does not influence the machine's state independently.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 393, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1650}, "estimated_cost": 0.007072500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-52.jsonl"}
