This suggests object 1 is not a blicket, and object 3 is responsible for the light being on.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine with object 2, the light is on. Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket, and object 3 is responsible for the light being on.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine with object 0, the light is on. Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket, and object 3 is responsible for the light being on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when it is placed on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed, even if other objects remain on the machine.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is indeed a blicket because its presence directly correlates with the machine turning on, and its removal correlates with the machine turning off.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 359, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1618}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067374999999999996, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-5.jsonl"}
