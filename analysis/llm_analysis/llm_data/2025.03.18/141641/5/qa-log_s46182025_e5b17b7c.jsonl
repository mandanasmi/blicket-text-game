This suggests object 1 is crucial for the light to be on.\n   - Removing objects 0, 3, and 2 after object 1 is removed keeps the light off. This indicates that none of these objects alone can turn the light on.\n\n3. **Adding Objects Back**:\n   - Adding objects 0, 3, and 2 back on the machine does not turn the light on.\n   - Adding object 1 back on the machine turns the light on. This strongly suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Testing**:\n   - Removing object 2 while object 1 is on turns the light off, confirming object 1's role.\n   - Adding objects 2, 3, and 0 without object 1 does not turn the light on.\n   - Adding object 1 with any combination of other objects turns the light on.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The light only turns on when object 1 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 3, when tested alone or with other objects except object 1, does not turn the light on.\n\nFrom this analysis, object 3 does not affect the machine's state independently and does not seem to be a blicket. The machine's state is dependent on object 1, and object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 1266, "total_tokens": 1635}, "estimated_cost": 0.006855, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-55.jsonl"}
