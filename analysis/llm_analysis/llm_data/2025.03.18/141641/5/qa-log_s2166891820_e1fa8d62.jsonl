This suggests object 1 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Tests:**\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, indicating object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is added back, and the light remains off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Object 0 is added back, and the light remains off until object 1 is added, turning the light on. This suggests object 0 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on, reinforcing that object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 does not affect the light.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light turns on, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on, indicating object 3 does not contribute to the light being on.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 1 is consistently associated with the light turning on, indicating it is a blicket.\n- Object 3, when placed on the machine alone or with other objects, does not cause the light to turn on. It does not seem to affect the machine's state when added or removed, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 490, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1749}, "estimated_cost": 0.008047499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-58.jsonl"}
