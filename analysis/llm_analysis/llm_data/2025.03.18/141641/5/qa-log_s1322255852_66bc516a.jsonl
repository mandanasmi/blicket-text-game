The fact that the machine turns on when object 3 is placed on it alone, after all other objects are removed, confirms that object 3 has blicktness.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect of object 3 on the machine, we conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1625}, "estimated_cost": 0.006807499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}
