This suggests that object 2 might also be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n\n3. **Testing Combinations:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light remains off. This suggests that object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light turns on, and when object 2 is removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, but it never causes the light to turn on.\n   - The light only turns on when object 1 or object 2 is on the machine, indicating that these are the blickets.\n\nBased on the above observations, object 3 does not influence the machine's state and therefore is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 348, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1605}, "estimated_cost": 0.0066225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-49.jsonl"}
