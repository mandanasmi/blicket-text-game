This suggests object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is added, the machine remains on, but this doesn't provide information about object 3 since object 1 is already on the machine.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 0 turns the machine off, suggesting object 0 might not be a blicket since its removal turns the machine off.\n   - Removing object 2 also turns the machine off, but since the machine was already off, this doesn't provide new information.\n\n3. **Adding Objects:**\n   - Adding object 0 turns the machine on, suggesting object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 keeps the machine on, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 2 keeps the machine on, but since object 0 is already on, this doesn't provide new information.\n\n4. **Further Tests:**\n   - Removing object 1 turns the machine off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 turns the machine on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the machine off, suggesting object 0 might not be a blicket.\n   - Adding object 0 turns the machine on, suggesting object 0 might be a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Observations:**\n   - The machine turns on when object 0 is added and turns off when object 0 is removed, but this behavior is inconsistent. The machine also turns on and off with object 1, which is a confirmed blicket.\n   - The machine turns on with object 1 alone, but not with object 0 alone, indicating object 0 might not be a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe interactions suggest that object 1 is a blicket, as it consistently turns the machine on when added and off when removed. Object 0, however, does not consistently turn the machine on or off by itself. The machine turns on when object 0 is added, but it also turns off when object 0 is removed, which is inconsistent with the behavior of a blicket.
