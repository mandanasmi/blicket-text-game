Removing object 0 turns the light off. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1: Placing object 1 on the machine does not turn the light on unless object 0 is also on the machine. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2: Placing object 2 on the machine does not turn the light on unless object 0 is also on the machine. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Interactions with Object 3:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine does not turn the light on, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Removing object 3 when the light is on (due to object 0 or object 2) does not turn the light off.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The state of the machine's light is unaffected by the presence or absence of object 3. The light never turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine, nor does it turn off when object 3 is removed while the light is on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's state and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 1259, "total_tokens": 1617}, "estimated_cost": 0.006727499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
