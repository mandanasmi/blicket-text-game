Removing object 0 turns the machine off, indicating object 3 alone does not keep the machine on.\n\n4. **Final Test:**\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the machine turns on. Then, object 3 is added, and the machine remains on. Removing object 0 turns the machine off, indicating object 3 alone does not keep the machine on.\n   - In another sequence, object 0 is not on the machine, but object 3 is placed on the machine along with other non-blicket objects, and the machine turns on. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket since the machine turns on without object 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on when object 3 is placed on it without object 0 being present, indicating that object 3 has the ability to turn the machine on independently. This suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 513, "prompt_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 1770}, "estimated_cost": 0.0082725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-12.jsonl"}
