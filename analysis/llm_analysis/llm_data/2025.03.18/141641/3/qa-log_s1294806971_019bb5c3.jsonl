This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 and object 3 while object 1 is still on the machine keeps the light on, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 after object 1 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 2 alone turns the light on, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 alone does not occur, so we cannot confirm its status independently.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - In the final sequence, removing object 1 turns the light on, but removing object 2 turns it off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 after object 2 is removed keeps the light off, confirming object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 and object 2 are confirmed blickets.\n   - Object 0 is confirmed not to be a blicket.\n   - Object 3's status is uncertain because the light never turns off when only object 3 is removed, and it is never tested alone.\n\nGiven the interactions, object 3's status as a blicket cannot be confirmed. The light turns off only when object 1 or object 2 is removed, indicating they are necessary for the light to be on. Object 3 does not independently affect the light status, so it is likely not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 505, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1721}, "estimated_cost": 0.00809, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-14.jsonl"}
