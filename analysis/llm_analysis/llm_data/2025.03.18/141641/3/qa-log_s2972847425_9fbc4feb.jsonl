This suggests object 1 might be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3 while other objects are on the machine does not turn the light off. This suggests object 3 might not be necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 does not turn the light off, suggesting object 1 might not be a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine results in the light being off. This strongly suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine when the light is off does not turn it on, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n   - The light turns on with object 0 or object 2, indicating they are blickets.\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the light on, and removing it does not affect the light when other objects are present. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the evidence, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness, as it does not independently cause the machine to turn on, nor does its removal affect the machine's state when other blickets are present.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 495, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1711}, "estimated_cost": 0.00799, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
