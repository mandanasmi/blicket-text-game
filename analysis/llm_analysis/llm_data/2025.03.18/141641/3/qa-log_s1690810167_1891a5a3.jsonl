This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 1, 2, and 3 sequentially keeps the light on, but removing object 0 turns the light off. This indicates object 0 is a blicket.\n   - In a subsequent test, removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine results in the light being off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 and 2 together keeps the light off, reinforcing that object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Removing object 3 while the light is on (with other objects) keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 might not be necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket because placing it on the machine alone turns the light on.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 451, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1667}, "estimated_cost": 0.00755, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
