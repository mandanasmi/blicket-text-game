This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - When object 0 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 0.\n   - When object 3 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 is not solely responsible for the light being on.\n   - Removing object 1 keeps the light on, suggesting object 1 is not solely responsible for the light being on.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 when object 0 is already removed keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 alone on the machine keeps the light off, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 alone turns the light on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 0 to object 2 turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - Removing object 0 while object 2 is on keeps the light on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 and object 3 with object 2 and object 0 doesn't change the light status, suggesting neither object 1 nor object 3 are blickets.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 alone, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 0 is removed, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself and does not affect the light when added or removed with other objects, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 550, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1766}, "estimated_cost": 0.00854, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
