This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the machine on when placed with any combination of other objects, except when object 2 is present. However, object 2 alone can turn the machine on, indicating that object 3 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 and object 2 are confirmed blickets because they can independently turn the machine on.\n   - Object 3 never turns the machine on by itself or in combination with other objects unless object 2 is present, which can turn the machine on by itself. Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 287, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1503}, "estimated_cost": 0.00591, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-49.jsonl"}
