This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is added, the light remains on. This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is added, the light remains on. This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is added, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 0, 2, or 3 while object 1 is still on the machine keeps the light on, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 after object 1 is removed also turns the light off, but since the light was already off, it doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 0 alone turns the light on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 alone turns the light on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns on with object 0 alone, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns on with object 1 alone, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - The light does not turn on with object 2 alone, confirming object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - The light does not turn on with object 3 alone, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above observations, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 468, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1684}, "estimated_cost": 0.00772, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-24.jsonl"}
