This suggests that object 3 could be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 3 might be necessary for the light to be on.\n\n2. **Subsequent Tests:**\n   - When object 1 is removed, the light turns off, suggesting object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - In multiple sequences, removing object 3 results in the light turning off, even if other objects are still on the machine.\n\n3. **Consistent Pattern:**\n   - The light turns off every time object 3 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This consistent pattern strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The consistent behavior of the machine turning off when object 3 is removed, and turning on when it is placed, suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect on the machine, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1504}, "estimated_cost": 0.00592, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-61.jsonl"}
