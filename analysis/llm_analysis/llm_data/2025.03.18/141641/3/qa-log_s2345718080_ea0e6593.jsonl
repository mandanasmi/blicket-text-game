This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Removing object 0 or object 2 while the light is on causes the light to turn off, indicating that both object 0 and object 2 are necessary to keep the light on.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine with other objects, does not affect the light status. The light remains on or off depending on the presence of objects 0 and 2.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, nor does it maintain the light when other objects are removed. It does not seem to contribute to the light being on in any combination.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 339, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1557}, "estimated_cost": 0.006435, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-38.jsonl"}
