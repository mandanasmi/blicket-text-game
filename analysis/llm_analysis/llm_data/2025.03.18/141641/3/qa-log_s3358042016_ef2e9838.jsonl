This behavior strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1498}, "estimated_cost": 0.005860000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-3.jsonl"}
