This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine with other objects (e.g., object 0, object 2), and the light remains on.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, even if other objects are present, suggesting object 3 is necessary for the light to be on in those cases.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Objects:**\n   - Object 0 and object 2 are placed on the machine, and the light turns on. However, when object 1 is removed, the light turns off, indicating neither object 0 nor object 2 is a blicket on their own.\n   - Object 1 is confirmed as a blicket since the light turns on when it is placed on the machine alone.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently causes the light to turn on when placed on the machine and causes the light to turn off when removed, even in the presence of other objects. This behavior is consistent with being a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1592}, "estimated_cost": 0.006784999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-31.jsonl"}
