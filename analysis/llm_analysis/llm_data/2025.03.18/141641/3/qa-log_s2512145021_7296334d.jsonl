Removing objects 1, 2, and 3 sequentially keeps the light on, suggesting that object 0 might be a blicket, or that the machine might stay on due to some other rule.\n\n7. Removing object 0 turns the light off. This strongly suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n8. Adding object 3 alone keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n9. Adding object 2 turns the light on. This suggests object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n10. Adding object 1 keeps the light on. No new information about object 1.\n\n11. Adding object 0 keeps the light on. No new information about object 0.\n\n12. Removing objects 3, 2, and 1 sequentially keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n\n13. Adding object 2 keeps the light on. No new information about object 2.\n\n14. Removing object 0 keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n15. Adding object 1 keeps the light on. No new information about object 1.\n\n16. Adding object 3 keeps the light on. No new information about object 3.\n\n17. Removing object 1 keeps the light on. No new information about object 1.\n\n18. Adding object 0 keeps the light on. No new information about object 0.\n\n19. Removing objects 3 and 2 sequentially keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n\n20. Adding object 3 keeps the light on. No new information about object 3.\n\n21. Adding object 2 keeps the light on. No new information about object 2.\n\n22. Adding object 1 keeps the light on. No new information about object 1.\n\n23. Removing object 3 keeps the light on. No new information about object 3.\n\n24. Removing object 0 keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n25. Removing object 1 keeps the light on. No new information about object 1.\n\n26. Adding object 3 keeps the light on. No new information about object 3.\n\nFrom the above interactions, the key observations are:\n- The light turns off only when object 0 is removed, suggesting object 0 is a blicket.\n- The light turns on when object 2 is added, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n- Object 3 alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 715, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1933}, "estimated_cost": 0.010195, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
