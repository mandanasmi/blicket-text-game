This suggests that neither object 2 nor object 3 can turn the light on by themselves.\n\n3. **Testing Object 0:**\n   - Adding object 0 to the machine turns the light on, even when object 1 is not present. This indicates object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 while object 1 is on keeps the light on, confirming object 1 is also a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is on the machine without object 1 or 0, the light is off.\n   - Adding object 3 to the machine with object 0 keeps the light on, but this is due to object 0 being a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 0 is on keeps the light on, indicating object 3 does not affect the light.\n\n5. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light only turns on with object 0 or object 1 on the machine.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, nor does it contribute to turning the light on when combined with non-blicket objects.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is not a blicket because it does not have the ability to turn the machine's light on by itself or in combination with other non-blicket objects.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1644}, "estimated_cost": 0.007305, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
