The machine's behavior can be explained by object 1 being a blicket, and object 3 does not independently or necessarily contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1727}, "estimated_cost": 0.0081575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-41.jsonl"}
