This suggests object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is added, the light remains on. This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 also turns the light off, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 does not affect the light when it is off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - When object 1 and object 2 are placed together, the light is off, indicating that neither object alone is sufficient to turn the light on.\n   - When object 0 is added to object 1 and object 2, the light turns on, suggesting object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 or object 3 while object 0 is on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Object 3 alone never turns the light on.\n   - Object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on when combined with other objects.\n   - The light turns on with combinations that do not include object 3, indicating object 3 is not necessary for the light to turn on.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1621}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-4.jsonl"}
