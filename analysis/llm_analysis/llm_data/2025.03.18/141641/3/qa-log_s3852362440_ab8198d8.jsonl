This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is added, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light remains on.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine, even when object 2 is not present. This suggests that object 3 can independently cause the light to turn on, indicating that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 583, "prompt_tokens": 1217, "total_tokens": 1800}, "estimated_cost": 0.0088725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-42.jsonl"}
