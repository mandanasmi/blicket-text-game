It only turns on when combined with object 1 or 2, which are already confirmed blickets.\n\nTherefore, object 3 does not have any independent effect on the machine and is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 458, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1673}, "estimated_cost": 0.007617499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-47.jsonl"}
