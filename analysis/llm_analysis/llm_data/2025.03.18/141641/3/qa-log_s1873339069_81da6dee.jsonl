Object 2 alone does not turn the light on, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Analysis:**\n   - The light turns on when object 0 and object 1 are on the machine, regardless of object 3's presence. This suggests that object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n   - The light turns off when object 0 and object 1 are removed, even if object 3 is still on the machine. This further supports that object 3 does not have blicktness.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not activate the machine on its own.\n   - The presence of object 3 does not affect the machine's state when other objects (0 or 1) are present.\n   - The machine's activation is consistently linked to objects 0 and 1, not object 3.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 375, "prompt_tokens": 1219, "total_tokens": 1594}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
