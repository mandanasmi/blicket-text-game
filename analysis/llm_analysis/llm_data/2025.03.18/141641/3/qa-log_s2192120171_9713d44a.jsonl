Object 2's presence doesn't affect the light.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off. Confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added back, and the light turns on. Confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. Supports object 3 being a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Tests:**\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light turns on. Supports object 3 being a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on. Object 1's presence doesn't affect the light.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off. Confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is added, and the light remains off. Object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains off. Object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light turns on. Confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. Supports object 3 being a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine and turns off when it is removed, except when object 0 is present. This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket, as it consistently affects the machine's light when object 0 is not present.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 622, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1840}, "estimated_cost": 0.009265, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-5.jsonl"}
