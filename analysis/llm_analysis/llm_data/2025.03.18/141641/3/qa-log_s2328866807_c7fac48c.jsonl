Removing object 0 turns the light off, even if object 2 is still on the machine.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - Object 0 is the only object that consistently turns the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself or in combination with other objects unless object 0 is present.\n   - Object 2, when placed on the machine with other objects, turns the light on only if object 0 is present, suggesting object 2 might have a conditional effect.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's light by itself or in combination with other objects unless object 0 is present. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not contribute to turning the machine on independently or in a necessary combination.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect on the machine, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1606}, "estimated_cost": 0.00694, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}
