The light remains off until object 3 is added, at which point the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket, but we need to consider the context.\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n   - The key sequence is when object 0 is not on the machine, and objects 2 and 3 are placed. The light turns on when object 3 is added, suggesting that object 3 can turn the light on independently of object 0.\n   - This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can activate the machine without the presence of object 0.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 423, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1639}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072699999999999996, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-12.jsonl"}
