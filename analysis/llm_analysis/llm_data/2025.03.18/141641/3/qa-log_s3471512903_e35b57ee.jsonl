This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the light on, and in combinations, it does not seem to affect the light status when added or removed, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 0 is a blicket because it can turn the light on by itself.\n   - Object 2 is a blicket because it is necessary for the light to be on in certain combinations.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the light status in any combination, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect on the machine's light, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 458, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1674}, "estimated_cost": 0.00762, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-14.jsonl"}
