Ensure only one answer is included.", "question_obj_idx": 3, "question_obj_name": "object 3", "response_msg": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions and the state of the machine's light.\n\n1. **Initial Observations:**\n   - Initially, object 0 is on the machine, and the light is off.\n   - Object 2 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added back, and the light remains on. This doesn't change the status of object 0.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests there is another blicket on the machine.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - Object 2 is added back, and the light turns on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't change the status of object 3.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't change the status of object 1.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light remains on. This doesn't change the status of object 0.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light turns on. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is added, and the light remains on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't change the status of object 0.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on. This doesn't change the status of object 1.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on. This doesn't change the status of object 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe key observations are when object 3 is removed, the light turns off, and when object 3 is added, the light turns on. This strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 612, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1830}, "estimated_cost": 0.009165, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-50.jsonl"}
