This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 2 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating object 1 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine results in the light being off, suggesting object 3 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine turns the light on, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while others are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket because removing it turns the light off.\n   - Object 0 is confirmed to be a blicket because placing it on the machine turns the light on.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself and is not necessary to keep the light on when other objects are present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 484, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1700}, "estimated_cost": 0.00788, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-21.jsonl"}
