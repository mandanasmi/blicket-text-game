However, when object 0 is placed with object 3, the light remains off. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket, and the previous instance of the light turning on was due to object 2 being present.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, and the light never turns on due to its presence. This strongly indicates that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 2 is confirmed to be a blicket.\n   - Object 0's effect seems dependent on the presence of object 2, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 never causes the light to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects, confirming it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 435, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1653}, "estimated_cost": 0.007395, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-11.jsonl"}
