This suggests object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on. This does not provide new information about object 3.\n   - Removing object 2 does not change the light status (still on).\n   - Removing object 3 while object 1 is on the machine keeps the light on. This suggests object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off. This further supports that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Adding object 2 turns the light on. This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 2 is on the machine keeps the light on. This suggests object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off. This further supports that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 alone does not turn the light on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 alone does not turn the light on. This suggests object 1 might not be a blicket when alone, but it could be part of a combination.\n   - Adding object 2 alone does not turn the light on. This suggests object 2 might not be a blicket when alone, but it could be part of a combination.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns on when object 1 and object 2 are on the machine together, but not when they are alone.\n   - Object 3 never causes the light to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects.\n\nBased on the above analysis, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket, as it never causes the machine to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 559, "prompt_tokens": 1223, "total_tokens": 1782}, "estimated_cost": 0.0086475, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-10.jsonl"}
