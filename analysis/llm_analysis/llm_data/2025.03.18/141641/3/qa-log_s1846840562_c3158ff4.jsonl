This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is added to the machine with object 2, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - When object 0 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 0.\n   - When object 3 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3, 1, and 0 sequentially while object 2 is still on the machine keeps the light on. This suggests that none of these objects are necessary to keep the light on when object 2 is present.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 2 back on the machine turns the light on again, confirming its status as a blicket.\n   - Adding objects 1, 3, and 0 sequentially with object 2 keeps the light on, but doesn't provide new information about their individual status.\n   - Removing object 2 while other objects are on the machine turns the light off, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Without Object 2:**\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 and 3 with object 0 keeps the light on, but doesn't provide new information about their individual status.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 2 and 0 on the machine turns the light on. Removing object 2 keeps the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 3 with object 0 keeps the light on, but removing object 0 turns the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine with object 3 keeps the light off, confirming neither object 1 nor object 3 are blickets.\n\nBased on the above analysis, object 3 is not a blicket because the light does not turn on when it is the only object on the machine, and it does not keep the light on when other known blickets are removed.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 555, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1771}, "estimated_cost": 0.00859, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-41.jsonl"}
