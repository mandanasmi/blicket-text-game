This doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 3 because object 0 is already on the machine.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. Again, object 0 is still on the machine, so this doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 1.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. Object 0 is still on the machine, so this doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 2.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3, 2, and 1 sequentially while object 0 is still on the machine keeps the light on, indicating these objects are not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine keeps the light off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 back on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine while object 0 is on keeps the light on, but this doesn't confirm object 3 is a blicket since object 0 is already a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 0 is on keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 1 alone on the machine keeps the light off, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine while object 0 is on keeps the light on, but again, this doesn't confirm object 3 is a blicket since object 0 is already a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 while object 3 is on keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key observation is when object 0 is removed and object 3 is left on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests that object 3 can independently keep the light on, indicating that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 579, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1795}, "estimated_cost": 0.008830000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-25.jsonl"}
