This suggests object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This could suggest object 3 is a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This could suggest object 1 is a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3, 1, and 2 sequentially still leaves the light on, indicating that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 alone on the machine results in the light being off, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 alone on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine results in the light being off, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - The light turns on when object 2 is placed on the machine, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 0 is added, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on, as seen when it is placed alone on the machine.\n   - The light only turns on when object 2 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of object 3.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 448, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1664}, "estimated_cost": 0.00752, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-58.jsonl"}
