This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket, as it doesn't affect the light.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off. This again suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is placed back, and the light turns on. This confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 1 is placed, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 2 is placed, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 3 is placed, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 0 is placed, and the light remains off.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine, and turns off when it is removed, indicating that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Object 0 also seems to be a blicket, as its presence or absence affects the light.\n   - Objects 1 and 2 do not seem to affect the light, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 535, "prompt_tokens": 1221, "total_tokens": 1756}, "estimated_cost": 0.0084025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-20.jsonl"}
