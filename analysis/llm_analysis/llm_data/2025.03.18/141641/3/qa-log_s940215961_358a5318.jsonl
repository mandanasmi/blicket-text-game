This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 keeps the light on.\n   - Removing object 0 keeps the light on.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 keeps the light off.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - Placing object 0 and object 3 together keeps the light off.\n   - Adding object 2 turns the light on, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 keeps the light on.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket when object 2 is present.\n   - Removing object 1 keeps the light off.\n   - Removing object 2 keeps the light off.\n   - Removing object 0 keeps the light off.\n\n4. **Final Test:**\n   - Placing object 0, object 1, and object 2 together keeps the light off.\n   - Adding object 3 turns the light on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe machine turns on when object 3 is placed on it, either alone or with other objects, except when object 2 is present. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket, as it consistently causes the machine to turn on when added, except when object 2 is present, which might have a different interaction rule. However, the consistent pattern when object 3 is added alone or with non-blicket objects indicates it is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 572, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1788}, "estimated_cost": 0.00876, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-17.jsonl"}
