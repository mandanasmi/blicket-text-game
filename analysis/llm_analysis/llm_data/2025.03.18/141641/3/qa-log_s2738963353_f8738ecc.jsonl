This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light remains on, but when object 3 is placed alone, the light is off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Analysis:**\n   - Removing object 2 while other objects are on the machine turns the light off, confirming object 2 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 1 or object 3 while object 2 is on the machine does not turn the light off, indicating that neither object 1 nor object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 alone, and it turns off when object 2 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This strongly indicates that object 2 is the only blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on, nor does its removal affect the light when object 2 is present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1592}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068000000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
