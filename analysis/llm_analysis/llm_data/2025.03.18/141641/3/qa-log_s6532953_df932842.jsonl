Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0, when placed on the machine with object 1, keeps the light on. Removing object 0 does not turn the light off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2, when placed on the machine with object 1, keeps the light on. Removing object 2 does not turn the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - Object 3 alone turns the machine on, which is a strong indication that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed, even if other objects are present, further confirming that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can independently turn the machine on and its removal turns the machine off.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 339, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1555}, "estimated_cost": 0.00643, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-26.jsonl"}
