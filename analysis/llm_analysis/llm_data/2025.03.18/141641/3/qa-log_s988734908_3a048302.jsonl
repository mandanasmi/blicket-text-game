This suggests object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - When object 2 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 2.\n   - When object 3 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 1, the light stays on. Object 1 is likely not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0, the light stays on. This suggests object 0 might not be the sole reason for the light being on.\n   - Removing object 3, the light turns off. This suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2, the light stays off. This suggests object 2 might not be a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 back on the machine, the light turns on. This reinforces that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 back on the machine, the light stays on. This doesn't change the status of object 0.\n   - Placing object 2 back on the machine, the light stays on. This doesn't change the status of object 2.\n   - Placing object 1 back on the machine, the light stays on. This doesn't change the status of object 1.\n\n4. **Removing Objects Again:**\n   - Removing object 0, the light stays on. Object 0 might not be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3, the light turns off. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2, the light stays off. Object 2 is likely not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1, the light stays off. Object 1 is likely not a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Tests:**\n   - Placing object 1 alone, the light stays off. Object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 alone, the light turns on. Object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2, the light stays on. This doesn't change the status of object 2.\n   - Placing object 3, the light stays on. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns off only when object 3 is removed, and turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine. This strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 612, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1827}, "estimated_cost": 0.0091575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
