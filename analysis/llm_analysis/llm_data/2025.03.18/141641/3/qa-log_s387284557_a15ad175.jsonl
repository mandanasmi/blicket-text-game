This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on. Removing object 1 does not turn the light off, indicating object 1 might not be necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 does not affect the light, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, strongly indicating that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 does not affect the light, confirming object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Repeated Tests:**\n   - The sequence of adding objects 0, 2, and 3 again results in the light turning on only when object 3 is added.\n   - Adding object 1 after object 3 does not change the light status, and removing object 1 does not turn the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off again, confirming object 3's role in turning the light on.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - In all scenarios, the light turns on when object 3 is on the machine and turns off when object 3 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 1, when added after object 3, does not affect the light status, and removing it does not turn the light off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 and object 2 do not affect the light when added or removed, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nBased on the consistent pattern that the light turns on with object 3 and turns off without it, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 454, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1669}, "estimated_cost": 0.007577499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-17.jsonl"}
