This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Adding Objects**:\n   - Adding object 1, 0, or 2 to the machine while object 3 is on does not change the light status (it remains on). This doesn't provide information about object 3 directly.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - When object 3 is off the machine, adding object 2 turns the light on, suggesting object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 with object 2 on the machine keeps the light on, but removing object 2 turns the light off, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 never turns the light on by itself, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Tests with Object 3**:\n   - Repeatedly, when object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, and when it is removed, the light turns off. This consistent behavior strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The light turns on with object 3 alone, and turns off when object 3 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This indicates that object 3 has the property of blicktness.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 371, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1589}, "estimated_cost": 0.006755000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-39.jsonl"}
