This suggests that object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3 while other objects are on the machine (e.g., object 1 or object 0) does not turn the light off, indicating that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on when other objects are present.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating that object 1 is necessary for the light to be on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, indicating that object 0 is necessary for the light to be on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine alone does not turn the light on, confirming it is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine alone turns the light on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine alone turns the light on, confirming it is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, turns the light on. This strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - The interactions show that object 3 can independently cause the machine to turn on, which is a key characteristic of a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 442, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1658}, "estimated_cost": 0.0074600000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-15.jsonl"}
