This doesn't provide information about object 0 alone.\n   - When object 3 is added to the machine with objects 2 and 0, the light remains on. This doesn't provide information about object 3 alone.\n   - When object 1 is added to the machine with objects 2, 0, and 3, the light remains on. This doesn't provide information about object 1 alone.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 1, 0, and 3 sequentially while object 2 is still on the machine keeps the light on, indicating that these objects are not necessary for the light to be on when object 2 is present.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 after object 2 is already removed keeps the light off, which doesn't provide information about object 3 alone.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Repeatedly, when object 2 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, confirming its status as a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 3 is added to the machine with object 2, but this doesn't confirm object 3's status independently.\n   - Removing object 2 while object 3 is on the machine turns the light off, indicating object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 2 is confirmed to be a blicket because the light turns on with it alone.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, as seen when object 2 is removed and the light turns off.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket because it does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 463, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1679}, "estimated_cost": 0.00767, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-43.jsonl"}
