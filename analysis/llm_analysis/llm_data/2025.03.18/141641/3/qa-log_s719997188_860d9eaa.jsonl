Removing object 0 turned the light off, again indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 and 3 were placed together, the light remained off, suggesting neither is a blicket on their own.\n   - When object 0 was added to object 2 and 3, the light turned on. Removing object 0 turned the light off, confirming object 0's status as a blicket.\n\n3. **Key Observations Involving Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine with object 0, and the light was on. Removing object 3 did not turn the light off, indicating object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine with object 2, and the light remained off, suggesting object 3 alone or with object 2 does not turn the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 0, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 3 does not independently or in combination with non-blicket objects (like object 2) turn the light on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1626}, "estimated_cost": 0.00714, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-29.jsonl"}
