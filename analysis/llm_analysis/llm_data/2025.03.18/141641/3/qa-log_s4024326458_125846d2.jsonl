This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was tested multiple times, both alone and with other objects, and the light was always off when object 3 was involved, unless object 0 was also present.\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Object 3 was on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, and the light never turned on unless object 0 was present.\n   - The light turned on with object 0 alone, and with object 2 when object 0 was also present, but never with object 3 alone or with any combination excluding object 0.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1592}, "estimated_cost": 0.006784999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
