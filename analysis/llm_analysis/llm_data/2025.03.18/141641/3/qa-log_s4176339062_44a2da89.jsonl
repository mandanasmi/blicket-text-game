It also does not affect the light when other objects are on the machine, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's light, whether alone or in combination with other objects. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 546, "prompt_tokens": 1219, "total_tokens": 1765}, "estimated_cost": 0.008507500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-18.jsonl"}
