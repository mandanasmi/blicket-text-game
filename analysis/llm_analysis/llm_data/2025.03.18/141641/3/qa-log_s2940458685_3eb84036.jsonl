However, when object 3 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 0 is the one causing the light to turn on.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1 or object 2, the light does not turn on unless object 0 is also present.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the light on, and it does not contribute to turning the light on when combined with other objects unless object 0 is present.\n   - The light turns on with object 0, regardless of whether object 3 is present or not, indicating that object 0 is the blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 does not have the property of a blicket, as it does not independently or necessarily contribute to turning the machine on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 284, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1499}, "estimated_cost": 0.0058775, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
