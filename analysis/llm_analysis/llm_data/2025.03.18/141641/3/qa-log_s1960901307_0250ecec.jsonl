This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 0, 2, or 1 is added to the machine with object 3 already on it, the light remains on. This doesn't provide conclusive evidence about these objects individually.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - When object 3 is removed from the machine, the light turns off. This strongly suggests that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, confirming its status as a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while other objects are on the machine turns the light off, reinforcing that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 1 is on the machine, even if other objects are removed, confirming object 1 is also a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently causes the light to turn on when placed on the machine and causes the light to turn off when removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This behavior confirms that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect on the machine's light, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1626}, "estimated_cost": 0.00714, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-44.jsonl"}
