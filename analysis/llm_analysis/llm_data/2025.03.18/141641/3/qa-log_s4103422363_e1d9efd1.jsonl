This suggests object 2 is not a blicket, but object 0 is the key.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself, nor does it turn the machine on when combined with object 2 or object 1. However, when combined with object 0, the machine turns on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not independently or in combination with non-blickets turn the machine on.\n   - Object 1 does not turn the machine on by itself or in combination with object 3 or object 2, further suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on with object 0, indicating object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not independently or in combination with other non-blickets turn the machine on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 480, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1696}, "estimated_cost": 0.00784, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-43.jsonl"}
