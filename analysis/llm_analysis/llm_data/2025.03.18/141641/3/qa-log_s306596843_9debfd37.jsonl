This suggests object 2 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Adding Object 0**: \n   - When object 0 is added to the machine (with object 2 still on it), the light remains on. This doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 0 since object 2 is already on the machine.\n\n3. **Removing Object 2**:\n   - After removing object 2, the light remains on with object 0 still on the machine. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket because the light stays on without object 2.\n\n4. **Adding Object 1 and 3**:\n   - Adding objects 1 and 3 while object 0 is on the machine keeps the light on. This doesn't change the status since object 0 is already suspected to be a blicket.\n\n5. **Removing Object 0**:\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off. This strongly indicates that object 0 is indeed a blicket because its removal causes the light to turn off.\n\n6. **Re-adding Object 2**:\n   - Re-adding object 2 turns the light back on, confirming object 2 is also a blicket.\n\n7. **Testing with Other Objects**:\n   - When object 0 is re-added, the light turns on again, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 while object 0 is on keeps the light on, further confirming object 0's status as a blicket.\n\n8. **Final Tests**:\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, and when object 0 is added back, the light turns on. This consistent behavior confirms that object 0 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 0 consistently causes the machine to turn on when it is the only object on the machine, and its removal causes the machine to turn off. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 453, "prompt_tokens": 1219, "total_tokens": 1672}, "estimated_cost": 0.0075775, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
