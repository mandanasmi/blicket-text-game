This indicates object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is on the machine and object 2 is removed, the light turns off. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is on the machine and object 3 is removed, the light stays on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light turns on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is added to the machine with object 1 and 2, the light remains on, but this does not confirm object 3 as a blicket since the light was already on due to objects 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Final Testing:**\n   - When object 1 is removed and only object 2 is on the machine, the light is off, confirming object 2 is not a blicket by itself.\n   - When object 1 is removed and only object 3 is on the machine, the light is off, confirming object 3 is not a blicket by itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 1 is a blicket because it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.\n- Object 2 appears to be a blicket when combined with object 1, but not by itself.\n- Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself and does not affect the light when combined with other objects that turn the light on.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 471, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1687}, "estimated_cost": 0.00775, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-16.jsonl"}
