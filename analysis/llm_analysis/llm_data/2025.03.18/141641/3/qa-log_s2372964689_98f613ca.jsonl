Removing object 0 turns the light off, indicating object 0 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - When object 3 is added to the machine with object 0 and object 2, the light remains on. However, removing object 0 turns the light off, indicating object 3 does not contribute to the light being on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, nor does it maintain the light when other objects are removed. The light only turns on with object 0 or object 2, suggesting these are the blickets.\n   - Object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light status, either alone or in combination with other objects, unless a blicket (object 0 or 2) is already present.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1642}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-7.jsonl"}
