This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Tests:**\n   - When object 2 was added to object 3 on the machine, the light remained on.\n   - When object 1 was added to objects 2 and 3, the light remained on.\n   - Removing object 1 did not turn the light off, indicating object 1 alone is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 2 was still on the machine turned the light off, suggesting object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine alone, the light was off.\n   - Adding object 2 turned the light on, indicating object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - Adding object 1 did not change the light status, reinforcing that object 1 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turned the light off, confirming object 2 is necessary for the light to be on when object 3 is not present.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine alone turned the light on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n   - The light turned off when object 3 was removed, even if other objects were present, indicating object 3 is crucial for the light to be on.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that object 3 is a blicket because its presence on the machine consistently results in the light being on, and its removal results in the light turning off, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1628}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071449999999999994, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-1.jsonl"}
