This suggests object 3 might be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 1 might be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n   - When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light remains on. This suggests object 2 might be a blicket, but we need more evidence.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 0 while other objects are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting other objects might also be blickets.\n   - Removing object 1 while other objects are on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting other objects might also be blickets.\n   - Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 3 is likely a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, indicating object 2 is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while other objects are on the machine sometimes turns the light off, reinforcing that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed alone and affects the light when removed, indicating it is a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 380, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1595}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068375, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-34.jsonl"}
