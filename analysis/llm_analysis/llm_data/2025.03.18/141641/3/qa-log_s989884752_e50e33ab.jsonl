Again, no new information about object 2.\n   - When object 0 is added, the light remains on. No new information about object 0.\n   - Removing object 3, 0, and 1 sequentially, the light remains on until object 1 is removed, at which point the light turns off. This confirms object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 after object 1 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine alone keeps the light off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine alone turns the light on, suggesting object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 2 and then object 1 keeps the light on. Removing object 0, 1, and 2 sequentially keeps the light on until object 3 is removed, at which point the light turns off. This confirms object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine alone keeps the light off, confirming object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Adding object 2 and then object 3 keeps the light on. Removing object 0, 2, and 3 sequentially keeps the light on until object 1 is removed, at which point the light turns off. This confirms object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine alone turns the light on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can independently turn the machine's light on when placed on the machine alone.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 503, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1719}, "estimated_cost": 0.00807, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}
