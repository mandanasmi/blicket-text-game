This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 0.\n   - When object 3 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 3.\n   - When object 1 is added, the light remains on. This doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 3, 1, and 0 sequentially keeps the light on, indicating none of these are necessary to keep the light on.\n   - Removing object 2 turns the light off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - Placing object 3 alone on the machine results in the light being off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine with object 3 turns the light on, suggesting object 1 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the light on, and it does not affect the light when other objects are removed or added. This strongly suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 does not have the property of a blicket, as it does not independently or necessarily contribute to turning the machine's light on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 1216, "total_tokens": 1578}, "estimated_cost": 0.00666, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-20.jsonl"}
