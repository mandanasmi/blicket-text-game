This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 0, 1, or 2 is added to the machine with object 3 already on it, the light remains on. This doesn't provide conclusive evidence about these objects individually.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - When object 0, 1, and 2 are removed one by one, the light remains on until object 3 is removed, at which point the light turns off. This strongly suggests that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Tests:**\n   - When object 2 is placed alone, the light is off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed alone, the light turns on, suggesting object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed alone, the light turns on, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The light turns on with object 1 alone and with object 3 alone, suggesting both are blickets.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed, even if other objects are present, confirming object 3's status as a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, and the machine turns off when object 3 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects. This strongly indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1591}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/13/action_log_trial-5.jsonl"}
