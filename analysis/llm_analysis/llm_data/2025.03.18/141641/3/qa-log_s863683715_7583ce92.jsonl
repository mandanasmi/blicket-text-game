Again, object 0 is the likely cause.\n   - When object 0, object 1, object 2, and object 3 are on the machine, the light is on. Object 0 is likely the cause.\n   - When object 3, object 1, and object 2 are on the machine without object 0, the light is off. This further suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n3. **Further Analysis:**\n   - Removing object 0 while object 3 is on the machine turns the light off, indicating object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - Adding object 3 to the machine when object 0 is already on it keeps the light on, but this is due to object 0.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light when it is on the machine alone or in combination with other non-blicket objects. The only time the light turns on with object 3 is when object 0 is also present, which is already known to be a blicket.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 462, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1680}, "estimated_cost": 0.007665, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
