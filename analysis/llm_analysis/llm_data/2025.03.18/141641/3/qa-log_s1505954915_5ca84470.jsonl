The light only turned on with object 3 when it was placed after a sequence involving object 0, suggesting that object 0 is the primary blicket.\n   - Object 3 alone does not have the property to turn the machine on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 392, "prompt_tokens": 1218, "total_tokens": 1610}, "estimated_cost": 0.006965, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/3/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
