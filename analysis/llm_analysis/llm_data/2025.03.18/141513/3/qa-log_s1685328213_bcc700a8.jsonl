Further interactions show that the light is off when object 3 is not on the machine, and it turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine. This consistent pattern supports the conclusion that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n6. The presence of other objects (0, 1, 2) on the machine does not affect the light when object 3 is not present, indicating that these objects are not blickets.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is a blicket because its presence is both necessary and sufficient to turn the machine's light on.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 1211, "total_tokens": 1503}, "estimated_cost": 0.0059475, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-8.jsonl"}
