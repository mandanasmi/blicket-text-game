The light remains on, which suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed back on the machine, and the light remains on. Again, this doesn't provide new information since object 0 is still on the machine.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light remains on when object 1 is removed, indicating that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 3 is removed, indicating that object 3 might not be a blicket, as object 0 alone keeps the light on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The interactions suggest that object 0 is a blicket because the light stays on when only object 0 is on the machine.\n   - Object 3 does not seem to affect the light when added or removed, as long as object 0 is present. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1633}, "estimated_cost": 0.007277499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-0.jsonl"}
