When object 0 is removed, the light stays on, suggesting object 0 might not be a blicket or there are other blickets present.\n   - Object 1 is put on the machine, and the light remains on. When object 1 is removed, the light stays on, suggesting object 1 might not be a blicket or there are other blickets present.\n\n4. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine initially.\n   - The light remains on even when object 3 is removed, indicating that there might be other blickets or a combination of objects that keep the light on.\n   - The light is consistently on when object 3 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The fact that the light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine initially strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket. The light remains on even when object 3 is removed, but this could be due to other objects being blickets or a rule that allows the light to stay on once activated.\n   - However, the initial activation of the light with object 3 is a strong indicator of its blicket status.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is likely a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 479, "prompt_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 1687}, "estimated_cost": 0.00781, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
