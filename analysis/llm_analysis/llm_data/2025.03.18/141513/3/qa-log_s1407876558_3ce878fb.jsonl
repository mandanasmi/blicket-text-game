This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light is off, indicating that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine with object 0, the light remains on, but this is due to object 0 being a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine with object 0, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket, but it is not conclusive without further isolation.\n   - Object 2 is placed on the machine with object 0, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 2 might also be a blicket, but it is not conclusive without further isolation.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not activate the machine, as seen when it was placed on the machine by itself and the light remained off.\n   - The light only turns on when object 0 is on the machine, either alone or with other objects.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not contribute to turning the machine on and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 1212, "total_tokens": 1593}, "estimated_cost": 0.00684, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-41.jsonl"}
