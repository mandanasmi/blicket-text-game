This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - However, there are instances where object 3 is on the machine, and the light is off. This occurs when object 0 is also on the machine, which we know does not turn the light on by itself.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 3:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine alone, indicating it could be a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 3 is on the machine with other known blickets (like object 1 or object 2), which is consistent with the behavior of a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is on the machine with object 0, but this is because object 0 does not activate the machine, and object 3 alone should turn it on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The evidence suggests that object 3, when placed on the machine, can turn the light on, indicating it is a blicket. The instances where the light is off with object 3 on the machine are explained by the presence of object 0, which does not activate the machine.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the machine's responses, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 424, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1631}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-23.jsonl"}
