This confirms that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n10. Object 1 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off, confirming that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n11. Object 3 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket because the light does not turn on when it is the only object on the machine.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket because the light does not turn on when it is the only object on the machine.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 471, "prompt_tokens": 1211, "total_tokens": 1682}, "estimated_cost": 0.0077375, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
