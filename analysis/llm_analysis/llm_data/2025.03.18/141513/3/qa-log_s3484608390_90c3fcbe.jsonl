This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 while object 0 was still on the machine kept the light on, reinforcing that object 0 is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 was added to the machine while object 3 was already on it, and the light remained on. This doesn't provide new information about object 3 since object 0 is already suspected to be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 2 was on the machine turned the light off, which suggests that object 3 was contributing to the light being on.\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n   - The light turned on with object 3 alone on the machine, which strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - The light turned off when object 3 was removed, even when object 2 was on the machine, further supporting that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 1209, "total_tokens": 1560}, "estimated_cost": 0.0065325, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
