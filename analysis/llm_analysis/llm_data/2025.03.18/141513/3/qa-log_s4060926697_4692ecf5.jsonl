Object 0 is also on the machine at this time, but object 2 is a confirmed blicket, so the light could be on due to object 2.\n\n4. **Critical Observations:**\n   - There is no instance where object 0 is the only object on the machine and the light turns on. The light is always on when object 0 is on the machine, but this is always in the presence of other confirmed blickets (object 2 or object 3).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the light never turns on with object 0 alone, and it is always on in the presence of other blickets, we cannot conclusively say that object 0 is a blicket.

Removing object 2 while object 3 remained on kept the light on, reinforcing that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 and object 3 were both on the machine, the light was on. Removing object 3 turned the light off, further confirming object 3's role.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, either alone or in combination with other objects. This behavior is consistent with being a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1569}, "estimated_cost": 0.006637499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
