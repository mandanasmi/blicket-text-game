This suggests that the rule for the machine to turn on requires both object 0 and object 2.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the light when placed on the machine alone or with other objects. It does not contribute to turning the light on.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket because it does not contribute to turning the machine on under any circumstances.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 1212, "total_tokens": 1625}, "estimated_cost": 0.00716, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-8.jsonl"}
