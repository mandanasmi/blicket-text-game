This suggests that object 2 might require another object to activate the machine, but since object 3 alone did not activate the machine, it is unlikely that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, and the light did not turn on unless object 2 was also present. This further supports the idea that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine only turned on when object 1 was placed on it, or when object 2 was placed on it with another object. Object 3 alone never activated the machine, and its presence did not seem to contribute to the machine turning on in any combination that was tested.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 1604}, "estimated_cost": 0.00698, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
