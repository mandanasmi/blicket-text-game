This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - With object 0 on the machine, adding or removing other objects (like object 1 or object 2) does not turn the machine off, indicating that object 0 alone can keep the machine on.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the machine off, even if other objects are present, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times, both alone and with other objects, but the machine never turns on when object 3 is added or removed.\n   - Specifically, when object 3 is on the machine without object 0, the machine remains off.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine only turns on when object 0 is on it, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself or in combination with other objects (except when object 0 is present, which is already known to be a blicket).\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness, as it does not cause the machine to turn on in any scenario.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1586}, "estimated_cost": 0.006784999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-37.jsonl"}
