This does not provide new information about object 2 since object 1 is already known to be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was removed, and the light turned off, confirming again that object 1 is the active blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects:**\n   - Object 1 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This is unusual since object 1 previously turned the light on. This suggests a possible change in the rule or a mistake in the sequence.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off.\n   - Object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off.\n   - Object 2 was placed again, and the light remained off.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 3 was placed multiple times, and the light never turned on.\n   - Object 0 and object 2 were also placed multiple times, and the light never turned on.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 1 is the only object that consistently turned the light on, indicating it is a blicket.\n- Object 3, when placed on the machine, never caused the light to turn on, either alone or in combination with other objects.\n- Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 431, "prompt_tokens": 1211, "total_tokens": 1642}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073375, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
