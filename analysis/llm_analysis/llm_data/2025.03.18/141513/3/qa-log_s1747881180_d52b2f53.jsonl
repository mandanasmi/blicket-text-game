This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - With object 1 and object 3 on the machine, the light is on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, even though object 3 remains on the machine. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket because it doesn't keep the light on by itself.\n\n3. **Additional Tests:**\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine again, the light turns on.\n   - Adding object 2 with object 1 keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 while object 2 is on the machine keeps the light on, supporting the idea that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times, but the light only turns on when either object 1 or object 2 is also on the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 1 or object 2, but not with object 3 alone.\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 329, "prompt_tokens": 1209, "total_tokens": 1538}, "estimated_cost": 0.0063124999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
