This suggests that object 0 might not be necessary for the light to be on when object 2 is present.\n\n6. **Final Analysis:**\n   - The key observation is that the light turns off only when object 2 is removed, regardless of the presence of object 0 or object 3. This strongly indicates that object 2 is the only necessary blicket.\n   - Object 0 turns the light on when placed alone, but since the light remains on without it when object 2 is present, object 0 might not be a blicket. However, the fact that it turns the light on when placed alone suggests it could still be a blicket.\n\nGiven the evidence, object 0 does seem to have the ability to turn the light on by itself, which suggests it is a blicket.
