This confirms that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3 Alone:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added to the machine with object 1, and the light remains on. However, since object 1 is already known to be a blicket, this does not provide new information about object 3.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, further indicating object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not cause the machine's light to turn on when placed alone, and it is not necessary for the light to remain on when other objects are present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 495, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1702}, "estimated_cost": 0.007967499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-25.jsonl"}
