This suggests object 3 alone is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine again, the light turned on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine after object 0 was removed, and the light remained off, reinforcing that object 3 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Object 1 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off, suggesting object 1 alone is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off, suggesting object 2 alone is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Combination Observations:**\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine with object 2, the light turned on. This suggests a combination of objects 2 and 3 might be required to turn the light on.\n   - Object 3 was removed, and the light turned off, indicating that object 3 plays a role in turning the light on when combined with other objects.\n   - Object 1 was placed on the machine with object 3, and the light turned on, suggesting that object 3 can turn the light on when combined with object 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the light on, but it does contribute to turning the light on when combined with other objects (like object 1 or object 2). This suggests that object 3 is a blicket, but it requires another object to activate the machine.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 is a blicket because it contributes to turning the machine on when combined with other objects.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 430, "prompt_tokens": 1206, "total_tokens": 1636}, "estimated_cost": 0.007315, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-22.jsonl"}
