This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket, but it doesn't negate the possibility of object 3 being a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light stayed on. Removing object 2 did not turn the light off, reinforcing that object 2 is not necessary.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key observation is that removing object 3 turned the light off, and placing it back on was not tested again, but the initial interaction strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket. The light turning off when object 3 was removed is a critical piece of evidence.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 450, "prompt_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 1658}, "estimated_cost": 0.00752, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-29.jsonl"}
