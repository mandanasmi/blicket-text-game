This suggests that either object 1 or object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 after object 1 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, and the light remains on. This doesn't provide conclusive evidence about object 3, as object 1 is already known to be a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is removed, the light turns off, even though object 3 is still on the machine. This indicates that object 3 is not a blicket, as it cannot keep the light on by itself.\n\n4. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 1 is on the machine, either alone or with other objects. Object 3, when placed on the machine without object 1, does not turn the light on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 404, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1611}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070574999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-38.jsonl"}
