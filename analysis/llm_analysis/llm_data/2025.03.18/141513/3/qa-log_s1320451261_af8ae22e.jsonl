This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket, but we need to focus on object 3.\n   - Object 2 was added to the machine with object 1, and the light remained on. However, when object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 2 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - Object 3 was not tested again in combination with other objects after its initial test, but its initial test was conclusive.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The fact that placing object 3 on the machine turned the light on, and removing it turned the light off, strongly indicates that object 3 is a blicket. It has the property of blicktness that activates the machine.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the machine's responses, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1572}, "estimated_cost": 0.006645, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
