This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket because its presence is necessary for the light to be on.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 is a blicket because its presence directly affects the machine's light status.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 417, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1622}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071825, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-1.jsonl"}
