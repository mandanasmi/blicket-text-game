However, when object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 3 alone does not keep the light on.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine with object 0, and the light was on. However, since object 0 is not a blicket, object 3 alone should have kept the light on if it were a blicket. But when object 3 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 1 or object 2 alone, indicating they are blickets.\n   - Object 3 does not keep the light on when it is the only object on the machine, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 445, "prompt_tokens": 1209, "total_tokens": 1654}, "estimated_cost": 0.0074725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-21.jsonl"}
