This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 2 alone.\n   - Later, object 2 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 2 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n5. **Interactions with Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine while object 0 is already on it, and the light remains on. This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 3 alone.\n   - Later, object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n6. **Final Observations:**\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, confirming that object 0 is the only necessary object for the light to be on.\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off, confirming object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 and object 3, when placed on the machine without object 0, do not turn the light on, confirming they are not blickets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 0 is the only object that, when placed on the machine, turns the light on. Therefore, object 0 is the only blicket.\n- Object 3, when placed on the machine without object 0, does not turn the light on, confirming it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 456, "prompt_tokens": 1206, "total_tokens": 1662}, "estimated_cost": 0.007575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
