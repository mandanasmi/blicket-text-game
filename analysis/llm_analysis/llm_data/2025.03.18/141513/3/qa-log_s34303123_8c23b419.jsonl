This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - With object 0 on the machine, the light is on.\n   - Object 1 is added to the machine with object 0, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times, and the light remains off each time.\n   - Object 3 is on the machine when the light is off, and removing it does not change the light status.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 0 is on the machine, and it turns off when object 0 is removed.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the light status when placed on the machine, either alone or with other objects.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 405, "prompt_tokens": 1209, "total_tokens": 1614}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-35.jsonl"}
