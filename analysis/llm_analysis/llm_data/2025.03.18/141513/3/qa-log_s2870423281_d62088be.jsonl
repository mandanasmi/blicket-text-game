This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 2 since object 1 is still on the machine.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0, and the light remains off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket since neither object 0 nor object 3 can turn the light on.\n   - Object 1 is added to the machine with object 3, and the light turns on. This is consistent with object 1 being a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, further indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 1 and object 2, indicating they are blickets.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine with object 0, does not turn the light on, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because it does not independently or in combination with object 0 turn the machine on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 399, "prompt_tokens": 1211, "total_tokens": 1610}, "estimated_cost": 0.007017499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-24.jsonl"}
