The machine turns on again when object 1 is placed back on, confirming object 1's status as a blicket.\n\n9. Throughout the interactions, the machine turns on when object 3 is placed on it and turns off when object 3 is removed (unless object 1 is present). This strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 appears to be a blicket because it can independently turn the machine on when placed on it, and the machine turns off when it is removed (unless another blicket, object 1, is present).\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 423, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1633}, "estimated_cost": 0.007254999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-56.jsonl"}
