This is a critical observation. It indicates that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\n6. **Re-adding Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is added back, and the light turns on again. This further supports the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n7. **Further Interactions:**\n   - Throughout the interactions, whenever object 3 is on the machine, the light is on. When object 3 is removed, the light turns off.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is the only object whose presence consistently correlates with the light being on. Therefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 394, "prompt_tokens": 1213, "total_tokens": 1607}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-18.jsonl"}
