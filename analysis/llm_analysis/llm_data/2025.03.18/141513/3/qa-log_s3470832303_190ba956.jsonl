This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Actions:**\n   - Removing object 2 while object 0 is on the machine keeps the light on, indicating object 2 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Placing object 2 back on the machine while object 0 is still there keeps the light on, but this doesn't change the status since object 0 is already a blicket.\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is indeed a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine while object 0 is off keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n3. **Further Analysis:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0 off, the light remains off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - The light only turns on when object 0 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on only when object 0 is on the machine, and it turns off when object 0 is removed, regardless of the presence of objects 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on, nor does it contribute to the light being on when object 0 is absent.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 392, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1599}, "estimated_cost": 0.006937499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-30.jsonl"}
