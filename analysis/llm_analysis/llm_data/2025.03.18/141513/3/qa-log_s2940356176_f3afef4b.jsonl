This doesn't provide new information about object 3 because object 2 is already known to be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine while object 2 is still on it, and the light remains on. Again, this doesn't provide new information about object 1.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on when object 2 is present.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on, further confirming that object 2 alone is sufficient to keep the light on.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3 Independently:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine after object 2 is removed, and the light remains on. However, object 2 is still on the machine, so this doesn't confirm object 3's status independently.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on when object 2 is present.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Throughout the interactions, object 2 is the only object that, when placed on the machine, consistently results in the light turning on.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine without removing object 2, does not provide evidence of being a blicket because the light remains on due to object 2.\n   - There is no instance where object 3 alone is placed on the machine and the light turns on, which would be necessary to confirm that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not independently cause the machine's light to turn on. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 468, "prompt_tokens": 1205, "total_tokens": 1673}, "estimated_cost": 0.0076925, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-34.jsonl"}
