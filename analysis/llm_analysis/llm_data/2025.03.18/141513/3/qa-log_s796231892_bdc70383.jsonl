Again, this doesn't isolate object 3's effect.\n\n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - When object 2 is removed, the light remains on, indicating that another object (possibly object 3 or object 0) is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light remains on, indicating that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light remains on, but when object 2 is removed, the light turns off. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns off only when object 2 is removed, indicating that object 2 is the only necessary blicket.\n   - Object 3's removal does not affect the light, suggesting it does not contribute to the machine turning on.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 355, "prompt_tokens": 1207, "total_tokens": 1562}, "estimated_cost": 0.0065675, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-4.jsonl"}
