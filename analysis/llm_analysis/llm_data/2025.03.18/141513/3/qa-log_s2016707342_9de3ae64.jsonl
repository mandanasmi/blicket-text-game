Since object 1 alone does not turn the light on (as seen when it is removed and the light stays on), this suggests that object 3 might be contributing to the light being on.\n\n7. When object 2 is placed on the machine, the light is on. However, when object 2 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n8. When object 3 is placed on the machine alone again, the light remains off, confirming that object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n9. When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light is on, but since object 1 alone does not turn the light on, this suggests that object 3 might be contributing to the light being on.\n\n10. Finally, when object 3 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 3 was contributing to the light being on when combined with other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, but it might contribute to the light being on when combined with other objects. However, since the light never turns on with object 3 alone, object 3 is not a blicket by itself.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 469, "prompt_tokens": 1213, "total_tokens": 1682}, "estimated_cost": 0.0077225, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-16.jsonl"}
