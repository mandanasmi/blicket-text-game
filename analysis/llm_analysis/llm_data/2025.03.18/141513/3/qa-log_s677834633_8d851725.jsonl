This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Reintroducing Object 2:**\n   - When object 2 is placed back on the machine, the light turns on again, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Multiple Objects on the Machine:**\n   - When both objects 2 and 3 are on the machine, the light is on. However, since object 2 alone can turn the light on, object 3 does not contribute to the light being on.\n   - When object 1 is added to the machine with object 2, the light remains on, but object 1 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n6. **Testing Object 0:**\n   - Object 0 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests object 0 is also a blicket.\n\n7. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 alone, and with object 0 alone, but not with object 3 alone.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself, and the light remains on when object 3 is removed while other objects are on the machine.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because it does not independently cause the machine's light to turn on. The light only turns on when object 2 or object 0 is on the machine, indicating they are the blickets.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 437, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1647}, "estimated_cost": 0.007395, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-3.jsonl"}
