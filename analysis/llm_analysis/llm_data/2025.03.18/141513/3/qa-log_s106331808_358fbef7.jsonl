This indicates that object 0 is a blicket because it can independently turn the light on when placed on the machine.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 0 is indeed a blicket because it consistently causes the machine's light to turn on when placed on the machine and off when removed, unless another blicket (object 1) is present.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 465, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1675}, "estimated_cost": 0.007675, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
