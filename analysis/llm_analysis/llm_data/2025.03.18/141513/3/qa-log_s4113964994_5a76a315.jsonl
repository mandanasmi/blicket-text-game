This suggests that the combination of object 2 and object 3 might be necessary to turn the light on.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light turns off, indicating that object 2 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains off, suggesting that object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine with object 2, and the light turns on. This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is placed on the machine with object 2, and the light turns on. This suggests that object 0 might also be a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 2 is combined with either object 1 or object 0, but not with object 3 alone.\n   - Object 3 does not seem to contribute to turning the light on when combined with object 2, as the light only turns on when object 2 is combined with other objects (1 or 0).\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because it does not contribute to turning the light on in any combination tested.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 1210, "total_tokens": 1596}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068850000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-39.jsonl"}
