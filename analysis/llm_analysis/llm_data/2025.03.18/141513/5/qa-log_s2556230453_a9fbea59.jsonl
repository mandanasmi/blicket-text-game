This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine while object 2 is already on it, the light remains on.

This suggests object 3 is not a blicket, contradicting the previous observation. However, the light turns off when object 3 is placed alone, confirming it is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Object 1 never turns the machine on when it is the only object on the machine.\n   - The machine only turns on when object 1 is present with other objects that are already known to be blickets (object 2 or object 0).\n\nBased on these observations, object 1 does not have any effect on the machine's state when it is the only object on the machine.

The light remains off when object 3 is the only object on the machine.\n   - The machine's state is not dependent on object 3, indicating that object 3 does not have blicktness.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 334, "prompt_tokens": 1249, "total_tokens": 1583}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064624999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-45.jsonl"}
