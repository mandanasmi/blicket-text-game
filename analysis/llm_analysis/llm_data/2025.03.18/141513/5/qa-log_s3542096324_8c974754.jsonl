This indicates that object 3 alone is not responsible for keeping the machine on, but it might still be a blicket if it contributes to turning the machine on.\n\n3. **Other Interactions:**\n   - Object 1 is put on the machine, and the light turns on. Removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is put on the machine, and the light remains off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is put on the machine, and the light remains on, but removing it does not turn the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key interaction is when object 3 is put on the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests that object 3 has the ability to turn the machine on, which is a characteristic of a blicket.\n   - Although the light remains on when object 3 is removed, this does not negate its initial effect of turning the machine on.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1617}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067875, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-56.jsonl"}
