This doesn't provide information about object 3 alone.\n   - Removing object 0 while object 3 is on turns the light off, suggesting object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine turns the light on, indicating object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine alone keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Key Observations with Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0, the light is on, but this is due to object 0, as removing object 0 turns the light off.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2, the light is on, but this is due to object 2, as removing object 2 turns the light off.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the machine's light to turn on. The light only turns on when object 3 is combined with other blickets (object 0 or object 2), but not when object 3 is alone.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 412, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1663}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072475, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-15.jsonl"}
