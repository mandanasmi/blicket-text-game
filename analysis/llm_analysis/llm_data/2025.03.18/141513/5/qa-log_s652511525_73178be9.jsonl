This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket because the machine stays on without object 0.\n   - When object 3 is removed from the machine, the light remains on if object 1 is on the machine, which suggests object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone (after object 0 is removed and object 1 is not on the machine), the light turns on. This strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket because it can independently turn the machine on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key observation is that when object 3 is placed on the machine without object 0 or object 1, the machine turns on. This indicates that object 3 has the ability to turn the machine on by itself, which is the defining characteristic of a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect of object 3 on the machine, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 1250, "total_tokens": 1616}, "estimated_cost": 0.006785, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-50.jsonl"}
