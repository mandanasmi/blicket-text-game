There is no evidence that object 3 affects the machine's state independently.\n   - Object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's state, as the machine turns off when object 0 is removed, regardless of object 3's presence.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket because its presence or absence does not correlate with the machine's state changes.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 1247, "total_tokens": 1612}, "estimated_cost": 0.006767499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
