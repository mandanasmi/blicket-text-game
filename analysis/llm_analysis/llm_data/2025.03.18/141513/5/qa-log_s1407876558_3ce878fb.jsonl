This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine with object 0, the machine remains on, but this is due to object 0, as object 0 alone can turn the machine on.\n   - When object 3 is removed while object 0 is on the machine, the machine remains on, indicating object 3 does not affect the machine's state when object 0 is present.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the machine on, indicating it does not have the property of a blicket.\n   - The machine's state is not dependent on object 3, as it does not change the machine's state when added or removed, except when other objects (like object 0) are involved.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because it does not independently affect the machine's state.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 325, "prompt_tokens": 1253, "total_tokens": 1578}, "estimated_cost": 0.006382499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-41.jsonl"}
