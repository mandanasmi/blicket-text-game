Removing object 1 turned the light off, indicating that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine with object 1, the light stayed on. Removing object 0 did not turn the light off, suggesting object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light stayed on. Removing object 2 did not turn the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Analysis of Object 3:**\n   - After object 1 was placed on the machine and the light was on, object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on. However, this does not provide new information about object 3 because object 1 was already confirmed to be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 was removed while the light was on, the light remained on, indicating that object 3's presence or absence did not affect the machine's state.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time the light was off was when object 1 was not on the machine. Object 3 alone did not turn the light on, and its removal did not turn the light off when the light was on. This suggests that object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket because its presence or absence does not correlate with the machine's state.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 411, "prompt_tokens": 1249, "total_tokens": 1660}, "estimated_cost": 0.007232499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-47.jsonl"}
