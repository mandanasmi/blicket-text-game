However, this does not provide new information about object 3 since object 0 was already causing the light to be on.\n   - Object 3 was removed while the light was on, and the light remained on. This suggests that object 3's presence or absence does not affect the light when object 0 is on the machine.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on. Later, when object 2 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 2 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine again, and the light remained on, but this was when object 2 was on the machine, which was already keeping the light on.\n\n3. **Final Analysis:**\n   - The light only turned on when either object 0 or object 2 was on the machine, and it turned off when both were removed.\n   - Object 3 was never observed to independently cause the light to turn on or off. Its presence or absence did not change the state of the machine when other objects were involved.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light, indicating that it is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1638}, "estimated_cost": 0.00702, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-20.jsonl"}
