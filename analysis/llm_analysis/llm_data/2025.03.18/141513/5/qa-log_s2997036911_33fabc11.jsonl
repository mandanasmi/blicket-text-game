This doesn't provide information about object 3 since object 2 is already known to turn the light on.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - When object 2 is removed, the light turns off, confirming object 2's role as a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine, the light turns on, indicating object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed while object 1 is on the machine, the light remains on, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on when object 1 is present.\n\n3. **Critical Observations:**\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone, there is no direct observation of the light turning on. The light only turns on when object 1 or object 2 is present.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 has never been observed to turn the light on by itself. The light only turns on when object 1 or object 2 is on the machine.\n   - The removal of object 3 does not affect the light when other known blickets (object 1 or object 2) are present.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light independently.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 1249, "total_tokens": 1675}, "estimated_cost": 0.0073825, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-51.jsonl"}
