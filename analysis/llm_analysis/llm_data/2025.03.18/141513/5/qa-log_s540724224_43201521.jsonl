The light remains on or off regardless of object 3's presence, as long as object 0 is on the machine.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 does not have any effect on the machine's light and therefore does not exhibit the properties of a blicket. The machine's state is independent of object 3's state.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 1250, "total_tokens": 1612}, "estimated_cost": 0.006745, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-42.jsonl"}
