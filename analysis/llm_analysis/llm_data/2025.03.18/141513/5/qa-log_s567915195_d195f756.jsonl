This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed while the light is on, the light turns off. This further supports the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Interactions with Other Objects:**\n   - Object 2, when placed on the machine, does not affect the light if object 1 is not present. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 does not affect the light at all, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine, and turns off when object 3 is removed, indicating that object 3 has a direct effect on the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is a blicket because its presence or absence directly correlates with the machine's light turning on or off.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 325, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1573}, "estimated_cost": 0.00637, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-37.jsonl"}
