The light only turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine with other blickets (like object 1), but not when it is placed alone.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not have a direct causal relationship with the machine's state.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 430, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1678}, "estimated_cost": 0.0074199999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-23.jsonl"}
