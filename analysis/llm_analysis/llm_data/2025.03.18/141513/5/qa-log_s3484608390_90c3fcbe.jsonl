This suggests that neither object 1 nor object 2 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Object 0:**\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine with object 2, the light turned on. \n   - When object 2 was removed, leaving only object 0, the light stayed on.\n   - When object 0 was removed, the light turned off.\n   - This indicates that object 0 is a blicket because its presence correlates with the machine being on.\n\n3. **Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, even though object 1 was already on the machine and the light was off. This suggests that object 3 can independently turn the machine on.\n   - When object 3 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 3 was responsible for keeping the light on.\n   - This behavior is consistent with object 3 being a blicket, as its presence affects the machine's state.\n\n4. **Further Confirmation:**\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine again, the light turned on, confirming object 0's status as a blicket.\n   - Object 3's ability to turn the machine on independently of object 0 further supports the conclusion that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 is indeed a blicket because its presence on the machine correlates with the machine's light turning on, and its removal correlates with the light turning off.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 1250, "total_tokens": 1624}, "estimated_cost": 0.006865, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
