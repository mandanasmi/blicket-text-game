This suggests that object 3 does not independently affect the machine's state.\n   - There is no evidence that object 3 alone can turn the machine on or off, indicating that it does not have the property of blicktness.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the machine's state (on) is not dependent on the presence or absence of object 3, object 3 does not have the property of a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the machine's responses, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 1249, "total_tokens": 1611}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067425, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-55.jsonl"}
