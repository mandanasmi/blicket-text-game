This is the first instance where the light turns on, indicating that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off. This further supports the idea that object 3 is a blicket because its presence on the machine correlates with the light being on.\n\n5. **Interactions with Object 1:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine while the light is already on (due to object 3 being on the machine). The light remains on, but this does not provide conclusive evidence about object 1's status as a blicket.\n   - Later, object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, suggesting object 1 might also be a blicket.\n\n6. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine and turns off when it is removed, indicating a direct relationship between object 3 and the machine's light.\n   - Object 3's presence on the machine is consistently associated with the light being on, which strongly suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 is indeed a blicket because its presence on the machine directly correlates with the machine's light turning on.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1674}, "estimated_cost": 0.007379999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-46.jsonl"}
