However, when object 3 is removed, the light turns off, indicating object 3 alone does not keep the light on.\n\n3. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on or stay on when other objects are removed.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on or keep it on. The machine turns off when object 2 is removed, regardless of object 3's presence. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 434, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1682}, "estimated_cost": 0.00746, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-7.jsonl"}
