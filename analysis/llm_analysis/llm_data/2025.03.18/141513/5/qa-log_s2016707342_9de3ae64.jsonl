This suggests that object 3 alone does not turn the machine on.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0, the light is on. However, since object 0 is already known to be a blicket, the light being on in this scenario does not provide new information about object 3.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light is on. Since object 1 alone does not turn the light on (as seen when it was removed and the light stayed on), this suggests that object 3 might be contributing to the light being on in combination with object 1.\n   - When object 3 is removed while the light is on, the light remains on if object 0 is present, but turns off if object 2 is the only other object present. This suggests that object 3 does not independently affect the light.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the machine's light to turn on. The light only turns on with object 3 when other objects (like object 0 or object 1) are present, and these other objects are likely responsible for the light being on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not have the property of a blicket, as it does not independently affect the machine's state.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 395, "prompt_tokens": 1254, "total_tokens": 1649}, "estimated_cost": 0.007085, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-16.jsonl"}
