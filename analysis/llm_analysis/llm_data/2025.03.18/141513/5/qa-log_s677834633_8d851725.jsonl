This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine, the machine remains off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 2 is placed back on the machine, the machine turns on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Further interactions show that the machine remains on when object 2 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The machine remains on when object 2 is on the machine, even if object 1 or object 3 is added or removed.\n   - The machine turns off only when object 2 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine's state is dependent on object 2 being on it. Object 2 is the only object that consistently causes the machine to turn on or off.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the machine's state when added or removed, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 360, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1611}, "estimated_cost": 0.006727500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-3.jsonl"}
