This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, further indicating that object 3 has a direct effect on the machine.\n\n5. **Interactions with Object 1:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on. This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 1 also has a direct effect on the machine.\n\n6. **Combined Interactions:**\n   - When both objects 1 and 3 are on the machine, the light is on.\n   - When object 3 is on the machine with object 0, the light is on.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that object 3 has a consistent effect on the machine's light, turning it on when placed on the machine and turning it off when removed. This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket, as its presence is directly correlated with the machine's light being on.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1661}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072499999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-52.jsonl"}
