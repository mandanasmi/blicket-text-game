This doesn't provide information about object 2 alone.\n   - When object 1 is removed, the light turns off, confirming object 1's role as a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine while object 1 is on it, and the light remains on. This doesn't provide information about object 3 alone.\n   - Later, object 3 is placed on the machine with object 0, and the light is on. However, object 0 alone can turn the light on, as seen in previous interactions.\n   - When object 3 is removed while object 0 is on the machine, the light remains on, indicating object 3's presence or absence doesn't affect the light when object 0 is present.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 1 alone and with object 0 alone, but there is no instance where object 3 alone turns the light on.\n   - The light remains on or off based on the presence of objects 1 or 0, not object 3.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not independently affect the machine's light and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 418, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1666}, "estimated_cost": 0.007300000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-13.jsonl"}
