Removing object 2 also does not affect the light. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Interactions with Object 1:**\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine does not turn the light on. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n6. **Further Confirmation:**\n   - Removing object 3 from the machine turns the light off, confirming that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Repeatedly placing object 3 on the machine consistently turns the light on, reinforcing the conclusion that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is the only object that consistently causes the machine's light to turn on when placed on it and causes the light to turn off when removed. This behavior is characteristic of a blicket, as it directly influences the state of the machine.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 395, "prompt_tokens": 1246, "total_tokens": 1641}, "estimated_cost": 0.007065, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-44.jsonl"}
