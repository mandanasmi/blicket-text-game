This indicates that object 3 is not solely responsible for keeping the light on when other objects are present.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on again. This reinforces the idea that object 3 can turn the light on by itself or in combination with other objects.\n\n4. **Additional Observations:**\n   - When object 3 is removed while other objects are on the machine, the light sometimes stays on, indicating that other objects (like object 0) can also keep the light on.\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine with no other objects, the light turns on, suggesting that object 3 can independently activate the machine.\n\n5. **Final Observations:**\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed and no other objects are on the machine, indicating that object 3 was contributing to the light being on.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed and other objects are also removed, confirming that object 3 was necessary for the light to be on in those instances.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 consistently causes the light to turn on when placed on the machine, either alone or in combination with other objects. This behavior indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 429, "prompt_tokens": 1252, "total_tokens": 1681}, "estimated_cost": 0.00742, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}
