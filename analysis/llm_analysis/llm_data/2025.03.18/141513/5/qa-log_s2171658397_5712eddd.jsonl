When object 0 is removed, the light stays on, suggesting object 0 does not affect the machine's state independently.\n\n5. **Interactions with Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine while object 2 is already on it, the light remains on. When object 3 is removed, the light stays on, suggesting object 3 does not affect the machine's state independently.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the machine on, and its presence or absence does not change the machine's state when other objects are involved. This suggests that object 3 does not have any blicktness and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 1249, "total_tokens": 1611}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067425, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-58.jsonl"}
