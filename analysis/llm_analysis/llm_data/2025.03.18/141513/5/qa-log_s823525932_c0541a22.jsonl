This confirms object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is placed back on the machine, and the machine remains on. This does not provide new information about object 2.\n   - Object 1 is removed again, and the machine turns off. This confirms object 1 is necessary for the machine to be on.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the machine remains off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is already on the machine when the machine is off, and removing it does not change the state of the machine. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on and off based on the presence of object 1. Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the state of the machine when added or removed, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 485, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1733}, "estimated_cost": 0.00797, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-38.jsonl"}
