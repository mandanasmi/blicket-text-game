This does not provide new information about object 3 since the machine was already on.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the machine stays on, suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 2 is added, and the machine stays on. Object 2 is removed, and the machine stays on, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added again, and the machine stays on. Object 3 is removed, and the machine stays on, further suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the machine stays on, indicating that other objects might also be blickets or that the rule is more complex.\n   - Object 3 is added and removed multiple times, and the machine's state does not change based on object 3's presence or absence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The machine's state does not change when object 3 is added or removed, indicating that object 3 does not have an effect on the machine's state.\n- Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket, as its presence or absence does not correlate with the machine turning on or off.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1657}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071875, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
