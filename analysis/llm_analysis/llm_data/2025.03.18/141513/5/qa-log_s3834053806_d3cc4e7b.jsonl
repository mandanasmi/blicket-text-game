This suggests that object 3 does not have the ability to turn the machine on by itself.\n   - The light remains off when object 3 is on the machine alone, further indicating that object 3 does not affect the machine's state.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the presence of object 3 does not independently turn the machine on, and the machine turns off when object 2 is removed despite object 3 being on the machine, object 3 does not have the property of blicktness.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 345, "prompt_tokens": 1246, "total_tokens": 1591}, "estimated_cost": 0.006565, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-27.jsonl"}
