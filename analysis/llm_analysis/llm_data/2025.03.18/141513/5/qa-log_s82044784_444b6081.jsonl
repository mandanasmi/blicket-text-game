However, since the light was already on before placing object 3, this does not provide new information about its blicket status.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - The light turns off only when object 1 is removed, and it turns back on when object 1 is placed back. This strongly suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - The light remains on regardless of the presence or absence of objects 0, 2, and 3, except when object 1 is removed.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The light's behavior is independent of object 3's presence. The light only turns off when object 1 is removed, indicating that object 1 is the only necessary object for the light to be on.\n   - Since the presence or absence of object 3 does not affect the light, object 3 does not have any influence on the machine's state.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 1252, "total_tokens": 1606}, "estimated_cost": 0.00667, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-63.jsonl"}
