This further supports that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 3 was contributing to the light being on, reinforcing that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Additional Observations:**\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - The light remains on when object 2 is removed while object 0 is still on the machine, supporting that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - The light turns off when object 3 is removed, even if object 0 is on the machine, indicating that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on in some configurations.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine, consistently results in the light turning on or staying on, and its removal results in the light turning off. This behavior is consistent with the definition of a blicket, as object 3's presence affects the state of the machine.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the effect of object 3 on the machine, we can conclude that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1663}, "estimated_cost": 0.00727, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
