The machine's state is primarily influenced by object 1, which is a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 373, "prompt_tokens": 1252, "total_tokens": 1625}, "estimated_cost": 0.00686, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-39.jsonl"}
