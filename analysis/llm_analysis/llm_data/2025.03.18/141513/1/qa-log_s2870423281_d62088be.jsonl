Removing object 3 does not affect the light, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Critical Test:**\n   - When object 1 is removed, the light stays on until object 2 is also removed, at which point the light turns off. This indicates that object 1 was the only blicket keeping the light on.\n   - Placing object 0 and object 3 on the machine without object 1 results in the light being off, confirming that neither object 0 nor object 3 are blickets.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation:**\n   - Placing object 1 back on the machine turns the light on again, confirming that object 1 is indeed a blicket.\n   - The light remains off when only object 0 and object 3 are on the machine, further confirming that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on by itself or in combination with non-blicket objects. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 1200, "total_tokens": 1601}, "estimated_cost": 0.007009999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-24.jsonl"}
