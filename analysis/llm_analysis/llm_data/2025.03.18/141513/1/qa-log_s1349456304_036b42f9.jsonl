This suggests they are not blickets.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, does not turn the light on. There is no evidence from the interactions that object 3 contributes to turning the light on in any combination.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 3 does not turn the light on when placed on the machine alone and there is no evidence of it contributing to turning the light on in any combination, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the resulting states of the machine, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 1197, "total_tokens": 1571}, "estimated_cost": 0.0067325, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-60.jsonl"}
