This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, further confirming that object 1 is necessary to turn the machine on.\n\n3. **Interactions with Object 0:**\n   - Placing object 0 on the machine does not turn the light on, whether alone or with object 3. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Interactions with Object 3:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine does not turn the light on, whether alone or with object 0. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - The light remains off when object 3 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects, except when object 1 is also on the machine.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only object that consistently turns the machine on is object 1. Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself or in combination with object 0, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 1202, "total_tokens": 1526}, "estimated_cost": 0.0062450000000000006, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-55.jsonl"}
