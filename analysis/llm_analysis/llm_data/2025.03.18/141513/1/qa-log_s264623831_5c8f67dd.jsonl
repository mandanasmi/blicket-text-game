Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 1197, "total_tokens": 1623}, "estimated_cost": 0.0072525, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-55.jsonl"}
