This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket, but it doesn't confirm object 3's status.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 1 is added to the machine with object 2, and the light remains on. This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is added, and the light remains on, but since the light was already on, this doesn't provide new information about object 0.\n   - When object 2 is removed, the light turns off, indicating that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine with object 2, and the light turns on. However, since object 2 is confirmed to be a blicket, this doesn't confirm object 3's status.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 2 is on the machine, either alone or with other objects. Object 3 alone does not turn the light on, and it only turns on when object 2 is present.\n   - Therefore, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket, as it does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 418, "prompt_tokens": 1199, "total_tokens": 1617}, "estimated_cost": 0.007177500000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-39.jsonl"}
