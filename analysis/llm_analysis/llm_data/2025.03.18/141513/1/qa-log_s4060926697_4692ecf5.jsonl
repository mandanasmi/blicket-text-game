This suggests object 0 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine with object 0, and the light remains on, suggesting object 1 does not affect the light when other blickets are present.\n\n4. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off, indicating object 3 was contributing to the light being on. This strongly suggests object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on, consistent with object 2 being a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is placed on the machine, and the light remains on, consistent with object 0 being a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed back on the machine, and the light remains on, consistent with object 3 being a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine, and turns off when object 3 is removed, even when other objects are present. This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions and the resulting states of the machine, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 498, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1694}, "estimated_cost": 0.00797, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-36.jsonl"}
