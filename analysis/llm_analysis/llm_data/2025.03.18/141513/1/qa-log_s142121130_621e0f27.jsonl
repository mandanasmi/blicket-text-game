This suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can turn the light on when paired with object 2, which previously did not turn the light on by itself.\n\n4. **Additional Confirmation:**\n   - When object 0 was removed, leaving object 3 and object 2, the light remained on. This further supports the idea that object 3 is a blicket because it can maintain the light being on without object 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 is a blicket because it can turn the light on when paired with object 2, and it is necessary for the light to be on when object 0 is also on the machine. The interactions suggest that object 3 has the property of a blicket, as it is involved in turning the light on in multiple scenarios.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 1197, "total_tokens": 1598}, "estimated_cost": 0.0070025, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-27.jsonl"}
