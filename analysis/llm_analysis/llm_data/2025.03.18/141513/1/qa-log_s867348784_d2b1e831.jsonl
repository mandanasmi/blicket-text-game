This suggests object 1 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Interactions:**\n   - Object 3 is placed back on, and the light turns on. This could mean object 3 is a blicket, but it could also be that object 0 was the only necessary blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light turns off. This suggests object 3 is indeed a blicket because its removal turns the light off.\n\nFrom the above interactions, we can conclude that object 3 is a blicket because its presence consistently turns the light on, and its removal turns the light off when no other blicket is present.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 517, "prompt_tokens": 1200, "total_tokens": 1717}, "estimated_cost": 0.00817, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-62.jsonl"}
