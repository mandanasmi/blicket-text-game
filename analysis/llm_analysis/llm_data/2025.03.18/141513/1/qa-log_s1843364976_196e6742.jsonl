The light only turned on when object 1 was involved, indicating that object 1 is the only blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not have any effect on the machine when placed alone, confirming it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 392, "prompt_tokens": 1198, "total_tokens": 1590}, "estimated_cost": 0.006915, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-10.jsonl"}
