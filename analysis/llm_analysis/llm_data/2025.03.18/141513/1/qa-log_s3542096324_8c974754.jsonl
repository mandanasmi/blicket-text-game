The light remains off.\n   - This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Second Interaction:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine. The light turns on.\n   - This suggests object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n4. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - Objects 0, 1, and 2 are placed on the machine while object 3 is already there, and the light remains on.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light stays on.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light stays on.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light stays on.\n   - Object 1 is placed back, and the light stays on.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light turns off.\n\n5. **Key Observations:**\n   - The light turns on when object 3 is placed on the machine.\n   - The light remains on when object 3 is removed, but it turns off when object 1 is removed.\n   - The light turns on when object 1 is placed on the machine, even when object 3 is not present.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 is a blicket because the light turns on when it is placed on the machine and turns off when it is removed.\n   - Object 3 initially seemed to be a blicket because the light turned on when it was placed on the machine. However, the light did not turn off when object 3 was removed, indicating that object 3 alone does not control the light.\n   - The light's behavior is consistent with object 1 being the blicket, not object 3.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 452, "prompt_tokens": 1199, "total_tokens": 1651}, "estimated_cost": 0.0075175, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-56.jsonl"}
