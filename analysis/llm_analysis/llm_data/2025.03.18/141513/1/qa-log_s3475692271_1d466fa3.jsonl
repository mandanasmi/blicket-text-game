Since object 2 was not on the machine at that time, object 3 could potentially be a blicket.\n   - However, when object 3 was placed on the machine alone initially, the light did not turn on. This strongly suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, as it cannot activate the machine by itself.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because it cannot turn the machine on by itself, and the machine's behavior can be fully explained by the presence of objects 0 and 2 as blickets.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 431, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1627}, "estimated_cost": 0.007300000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-20.jsonl"}
