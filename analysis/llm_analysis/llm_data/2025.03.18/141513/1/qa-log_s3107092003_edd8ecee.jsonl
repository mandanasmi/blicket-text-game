This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is removed, the light turns off, further confirming that object 1 is necessary to activate the machine.\n\n3. **Interactions with Object 3 and Object 1:**\n   - When both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine, the light is on. However, since object 1 alone can turn the light on, object 3's presence does not provide additional information about its status as a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Tests with Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine multiple times without object 1, and the light remains off each time. This consistently suggests that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n5. **Interactions with Other Objects:**\n   - Object 2 and object 0 are also tested, and neither turns the light on when placed on the machine alone or with object 3.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The consistent result that object 3 does not turn the light on when placed on the machine alone, combined with the fact that object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket, strongly suggests that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1553}, "estimated_cost": 0.00656, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-57.jsonl"}
