This further confirms object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is on the machine, and the light is off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains off. This further suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket because its presence is necessary for the light to be on.\n- Object 2 and object 3 do not seem to affect the light when object 1 is not present, suggesting they are not blickets.\n- Object 0 initially turned the light on, but later tests suggest it is not necessary for the light to be on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because the light does not turn on when it is the only object on the machine.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 535, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1731}, "estimated_cost": 0.00834, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-38.jsonl"}
