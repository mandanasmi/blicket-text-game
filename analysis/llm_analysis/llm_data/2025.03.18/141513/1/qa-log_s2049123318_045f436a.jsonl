This strongly suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Tests**:\n   - With object 2 off, adding object 3 does not turn the machine on. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Adding object 2 back on turns the machine on again, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 2 is on does not turn the machine off, further suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Observations**:\n   - The machine only turns off when object 2 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 3, when placed on the machine without object 2, does not turn the machine on.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's state when object 2 is not present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 1201, "total_tokens": 1539}, "estimated_cost": 0.006382499999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-11.jsonl"}
