This does not confirm object 0 as a blicket since object 2 is already known to be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is added, and the light remains on. Again, this does not confirm object 1 as a blicket since object 2 is still on the machine.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added, and the light remains on. This does not confirm object 3 as a blicket since object 2 is still on the machine.\n\n4. **Removing Object 2:**\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains on. This suggests that another object on the machine is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light turns off. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Testing Object 1 and Object 3:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off, confirming object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off, confirming object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nFrom the above analysis, object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on when it is the only object on the machine. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 449, "prompt_tokens": 1200, "total_tokens": 1649}, "estimated_cost": 0.00749, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-59.jsonl"}
