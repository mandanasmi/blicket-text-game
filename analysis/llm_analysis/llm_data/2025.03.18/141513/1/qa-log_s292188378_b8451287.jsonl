This suggests object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on when object 2 is present.\n   - Object 3 is never tested alone on the machine. The light is never observed to turn on solely due to object 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 and object 0 individually, confirming they are blickets.\n   - Object 3 is only tested in combination with other known blickets (object 2), and the light remains on. However, object 3 is never tested alone, and the light never turns on solely due to object 3.\n   - Therefore, there is no evidence that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 430, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1626}, "estimated_cost": 0.00729, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
