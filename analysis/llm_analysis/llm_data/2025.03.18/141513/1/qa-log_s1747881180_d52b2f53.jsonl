This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Interactions:**\n   - With objects 1 and 3 on the machine, the light is on.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, even though object 3 remains on the machine. This suggests object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3 Alone:**\n   - When object 3 is on the machine by itself, the light is off.\n   - This confirms that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n4. **Interactions with Other Objects:**\n   - When object 1 is on the machine, the light is on, regardless of object 3's presence.\n   - When object 2 is added with object 1, the light remains on, but removing object 1 while object 2 is on keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 0, when added, does not change the state of the light when object 1 is present, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself.\n   - The light turns on and off based on the presence of objects 1 and 2, not object 3.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 1198, "total_tokens": 1549}, "estimated_cost": 0.006505, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-28.jsonl"}
