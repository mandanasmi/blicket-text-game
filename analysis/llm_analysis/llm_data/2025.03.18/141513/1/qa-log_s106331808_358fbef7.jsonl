This could mean object 2 is a blicket, or the light is on due to another object.\n\n2. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 0 turns the light off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 after object 0 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 after object 0 is removed keeps the light off, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine alone (after object 0 is removed) keeps the light off, reinforcing that object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Placing object 0 back on the machine turns the light on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 while object 0 is on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 3 while object 0 is on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine turns the light on, suggesting object 1 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 1 turns the light off, confirming object 1 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 does not independently cause the machine to turn on. The light only turns on when object 0 or object 1 is on the machine. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 444, "prompt_tokens": 1199, "total_tokens": 1643}, "estimated_cost": 0.0074375000000000005, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-32.jsonl"}
