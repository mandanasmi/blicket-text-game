This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Combination Tests:**\n   - With object 0 on the machine, adding object 1 or 2 keeps the light on, indicating they do not affect the light when object 0 is present.\n   - Removing object 0 while other objects are on the machine (e.g., object 1 or 2) turns the light off, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Re-adding Object 3:**\n   - When object 3 is placed back on the machine, the light turns on, even when object 0 is not on the machine. This suggests that object 3 can independently turn the light on, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n6. **Further Tests:**\n   - Object 3 is removed again, and the light remains on if object 0 is present, but turns off if object 0 is absent. This further supports that object 3 is a blicket because it can independently turn the light on.\n\nBased on these observations, object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can independently cause the machine's light to turn on when placed on the machine.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 1201, "total_tokens": 1597}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069625, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-22.jsonl"}
