This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects:**\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off. Object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off. Object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Further Tests:**\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light remains on. Object 1 is not affecting the light.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on. Object 3 is not affecting the light.\n   - Object 0 is placed on the machine, and the light remains on. Object 0 does not affect the light.\n\n5. **Additional Observations:**\n   - Whenever object 2 is on the machine, the light is on, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - The light remains on when object 3 is on the machine with object 2, but object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 2 is the only object that consistently causes the light to turn on, indicating it is a blicket. Object 3 does not turn the light on by itself and does not affect the light when combined with other objects.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 398, "prompt_tokens": 1199, "total_tokens": 1597}, "estimated_cost": 0.0069775, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-3.jsonl"}
