This does not provide conclusive evidence about object 3 because object 2 is already causing the light to be on.\n   - When object 0 is placed on the machine (with object 2 already on it), the light remains on. Again, this does not provide conclusive evidence about object 0 because object 2 is already causing the light to be on.\n\n3. **Further Observations:**\n   - Removing object 0, object 1, and object 3 individually while object 2 is on the machine does not turn the light off. This suggests that none of these objects are necessary to keep the light on, reinforcing that object 2 is the key blicket.\n   - The light remains on even when object 3 is removed, indicating that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 and remains on regardless of the presence of object 3. This suggests that object 3 does not contribute to turning the light on.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 359, "prompt_tokens": 1199, "total_tokens": 1558}, "estimated_cost": 0.0065875, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-54.jsonl"}
