Removing object 2 while object 0 is on the machine keeps the light on, suggesting object 0 is also a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is removed, the light turns off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3 Independently:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine alone (after all other objects are removed), the light remains off. This strongly suggests that object 3 is not a blicket because it does not turn the machine on by itself.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 does not turn the machine on when placed alone, and it does not affect the machine's state when other known blickets are present. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 379, "prompt_tokens": 1200, "total_tokens": 1579}, "estimated_cost": 0.006789999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-30.jsonl"}
