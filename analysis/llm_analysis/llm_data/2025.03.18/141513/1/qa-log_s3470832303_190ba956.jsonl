This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Interactions:**\n   - Removing object 2 while object 0 was on the machine kept the light on, reinforcing that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Placing object 2 back on the machine with object 0 kept the light on, but this doesn't provide new information about object 2.\n   - Removing object 0 turned the light off, confirming object 0's role as a blicket.\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine while object 0 was off did not turn the light on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Analysis:**\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine alone, the light remained off.\n   - The light only turned on when object 0 was on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n   - Object 3 was on the machine multiple times without object 0, and the light was off each time.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light only turns on when object 0 is on the machine, indicating that object 0 is the only blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not affect the light when placed on the machine alone or with other non-blicket objects.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1565}, "estimated_cost": 0.00668, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/2/action_log_trial-30.jsonl"}
