There is no evidence that object 3 independently causes the light to turn on or off. The light remains on when object 3 is removed, suggesting that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because it does not independently cause the machine's light to turn on.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 416, "prompt_tokens": 1199, "total_tokens": 1615}, "estimated_cost": 0.0071575, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-53.jsonl"}
