This suggests that object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n   - **Removing object 0 (with object 1 on):** The light turns off. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket, and object 0 might be a blicket.\n   - **Putting object 0 back on (with object 1):** The light turns on. This supports the idea that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - **Removing object 0 (with object 1 on):** The light turns off. This further supports that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 2 is a confirmed blicket because it turns the light on by itself.\n   - Object 0 is likely a blicket because the light turns on with it and off without it.\n   - Object 1 is not a blicket because the light turns off when only it is on the machine.\n   - Object 3 does not seem to affect the light when added or removed, especially when object 0 is on the machine. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 534, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1730}, "estimated_cost": 0.008329999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-4.jsonl"}
