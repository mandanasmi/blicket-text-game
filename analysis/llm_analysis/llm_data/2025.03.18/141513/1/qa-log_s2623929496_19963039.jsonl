However, when object 0 is removed, the light turns off, indicating object 1 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on, but when object 0 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests object 2 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n3. **Final Observations:**\n   - When object 3 is placed on the machine without object 0, the light is off. This confirms that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n   - The light only turns on when object 0 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 0 is the only object that consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it.\n- Object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on when placed alone, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the machine's responses, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 1199, "total_tokens": 1589}, "estimated_cost": 0.0068975, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-14.jsonl"}
