Object 2 is still on the machine, so the light being on could still be due to object 2.\n\n3. **Critical Observations:**\n   - At one point, object 2 is the only object on the machine, and the light is on. This confirms object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine when object 2 is already on it, and the light remains on. This doesn't confirm object 3 as a blicket because object 2 is already known to activate the machine.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, further suggesting object 3 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turns on with object 2 alone, confirming object 2 is a blicket.\n   - Object 3's presence or absence does not affect the light when object 2 is on the machine, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket because the light remains on without it, as long as object 2 is present.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 480, "prompt_tokens": 1194, "total_tokens": 1674}, "estimated_cost": 0.007785, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-34.jsonl"}
