This suggests object 0 is not necessary for the light to be on, indicating it might not be a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is removed, and the light turns off. This confirms object 1 is a blicket, as its presence is necessary for the light to be on.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 3 is placed on the machine alone, and the light remains off. This strongly suggests object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not turn the light on by itself.\n   - Object 1 is placed back on the machine, and the light turns on again, confirming object 1's status as a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is added again with object 1, and the light remains on. However, since object 1 is already known to be a blicket, object 3's presence does not provide new information.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key observation is when object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light remains off. This indicates that object 3 does not have the ability to turn the machine on by itself, which is a defining characteristic of a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 463, "prompt_tokens": 1196, "total_tokens": 1659}, "estimated_cost": 0.00762, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-25.jsonl"}
