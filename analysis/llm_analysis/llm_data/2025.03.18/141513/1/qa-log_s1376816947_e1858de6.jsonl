This does not provide information about object 3 alone.\n   - Object 0 is removed, and the light remains on, indicating that another object (either object 2 or object 3) might be a blicket.\n   - Object 2 is removed, and the light remains on, suggesting object 3 might be a blicket.\n   - Object 3 is removed, and the light remains on, which is unexpected. This suggests that the previous state might have been misinterpreted, or there is a complex interaction rule.\n   - Object 0 is removed again, and the light turns off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1 is placed on the machine, and the light remains off, confirming object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key observation is when object 0 is removed, the light turns off, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n   - When object 3 is removed, the light remains on, which is inconsistent with it being a blicket unless there is a complex rule.\n   - The final state with object 0 removed and the light off confirms object 0 is the primary blicket.\n   - Object 3 does not independently cause the light to turn on or off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the interactions, object 3 does not appear to be a blicket. The light's behavior is primarily influenced by object 0.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 503, "prompt_tokens": 1195, "total_tokens": 1698}, "estimated_cost": 0.0080175, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.17/223904/12/action_log_trial-40.jsonl"}
