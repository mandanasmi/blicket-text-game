The light on the machine is now on.\n\nBased on the information you have gathered, answer the following question: Is object 7 a blicket?\n\nFirst briefly reason and think about the information collected. Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "From the information gathered, we can observe the following:\n\n- Initially, placing any single object on the machine did not turn the light on, except for object 1.\n- When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n- When object 2 was placed on the machine with object 1, the light remained on, but when object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 2 alone does not turn the light on.\n- Placing object 3 on the machine with object 1 kept the light on, but object 3 alone did not turn the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 1 is a blicket, as it consistently turns the machine on when placed on it. Objects 2 and 3 do not turn the machine on by themselves, but they do not prevent the machine from turning on when object 1 is present.\n\nObject 7 was placed on the machine alone, and the light did not turn on. There is no evidence that object 7 is a blicket, as it did not contribute to turning the machine on in any of the tests.\n\nTherefore, based on the information collected, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
