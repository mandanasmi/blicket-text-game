When object 6 is on the machine alone, the light is off. When object 5 is on the machine alone, the light is off. However, when both objects 5 and 6 are on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that both objects 5 and 6 are required to turn on the machine, indicating they are both blickets.\n\nObject 7 was placed on the machine, but it did not turn the light on, either alone or in combination with other objects.
