However, when object 3 is placed on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. The light only turns on when object 2 is on the machine, regardless of whether object 3 is also on the machine. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not independently cause the light to turn on.\n\n> False", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 93, "prompt_tokens": 1256, "total_tokens": 1349}, "api_error": false}
