When object 1 is on the machine alone, the light is off. When object 2 is on the machine alone, the light is off. Object 3 was on the machine with object 2, and the light was on, but when object 3 was on the machine alone, the light was off. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, as it does not turn the light on by itself.\n\n> False", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 1255, "total_tokens": 1366}, "api_error": false}
