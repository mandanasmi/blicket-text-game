Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "From the observations, the light turns on when object 2 is on the machine with object 1. When object 1 is on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. Similarly, when object 3 is on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. The light only turns on when object 2 is on the machine with object 1. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket, and object 1 is required for the light to turn on. Object 3 does not seem to have any effect on the light when placed on the machine alone or with object 1.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 1256, "total_tokens": 1394}, "api_error": false}
