The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> put object 2 on the machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 3 off the machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> put object 0 on the machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 2 off the machine\nYou took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 7 on the machine\nYou put object 7 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 5 on the machine\nYou put object 5 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 4 on the machine\nYou put object 4 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> put object 2 on the machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 4 off the machine\nYou took object 4 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> put object 3 on the machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 0 off the machine\nYou took object 0 off of the machine.
