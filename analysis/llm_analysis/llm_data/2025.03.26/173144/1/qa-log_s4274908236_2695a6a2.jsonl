You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYou will be given a history of another agent's interactions within the same game, where the agent's action is indicated with '>'. The objects and the machine that you're given are the same as the ones given to that agent. You will then be asked a True/False question. You should answer the question to the best of your ability based on the given history of interaction.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Infer from the interactions which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on.\n- Do the above in order to answer the question correctly.\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n", "user_prompt": "You are in a room.
