Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYou will be given a history of another agent's interactions within the same game, where the agent's action is indicated with '>'. The objects and the machine that you're given are the same as the ones given to that agent. You will then be asked a True/False question. You should answer the question to the best of your ability based on the given history of interaction.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Infer from the interactions which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on.\n- Do the above in order to answer the question correctly.\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n", "user_prompt": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 8 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor, object 4 is on the floor, object 5 is on top of the machine, object 6 is on the floor, object 7 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> put object 0 on the machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 2 on the machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 1 on the machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 7 on the machine\nYou put object 7 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 6 on the machine\nYou put object 6 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 3 on the machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine.

The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 0 off the machine\nYou took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take object 7 off the machine\nYou took object 7 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 0 on the machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine.

The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 2 off the machine\nYou took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 6 off the machine\nYou took object 6 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n\n\nBased on the information above, is object 7 a blicket?\n\nDirectly output the answer in the format '> True/False'.
