You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor, object 4 is on the floor, object 5 is on the floor, object 6 is on the floor, object 7 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> put object 6 on the machine\nYou put object 6 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 0 on the machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 3 on the machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 1 on the machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 4 on the machine\nYou put object 4 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 0 off the machine\nYou took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 6 off the machine\nYou took object 6 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 2 on the machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine.

The light on the machine is currently off.\n> take object 3 off the machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 6 on the machine\nYou put object 6 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 1 off the machine\nYou took object 1 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n\n\nBased on the information above, is object 7 a blicket?\n\nDirectly output the answer in the format '> True/False'.
