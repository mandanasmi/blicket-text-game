Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

The hypotheses should not have been previously generated and should consider different combinations of objects and boolean operations (either \"any\" or \"all\").\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine which objects (blickets) cause the machine to turn on based on their placement. The machine's activation follows a hidden rule that could involve either having at least one blicket (any) or all blickets (all) on the machine.\n2. **Existing Hypotheses**: Previous hypotheses tested individual objects and pairs, so we need to explore combinations that haven't been tested yet.\n3. **New Combinations**: We consider combinations of three objects and pairs that haven't been tested. For example, using objects 3, 4, and 5 with the \"any\" operation and objects 6 and 7 with the \"all\" operation.\n\n### Hypotheses\n1. **Hypothesis 1**: The machine turns on if any of the objects 3, 4, or 5 are placed on it.\n2. **Hypothesis 2**: The machine turns on only if both objects 6 and 7 are placed on it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef h63(state):\n    mask = [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0]  # Objects 3, 4, 5 are blickets\n    return np.any(state[mask])\n\ndef h64(state):\n    mask = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]  # Objects 6, 7 are blickets\n    return np.all(state[mask])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Hypothesis 63**: This hypothesis checks if any of the objects 3, 4, or 5 (blickets) are on the machine. The machine turns on if at least one of these objects is placed on it.\n- **Hypothesis 64**: This hypothesis checks if both objects 6 and 7 (blickets) are on the machine. The machine turns on only if both are placed on it simultaneously. \n\nThese hypotheses explore different combinations of objects and boolean operations, ensuring diversity in both the blicket masks and the activation functions.", "hyp_usage": {"completion_tokens": 4093, "prompt_tokens": 2680, "total_tokens": 6773, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 640, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 2040}, "hyp_api_error": "false", "hyp_parse_error": "false"}

The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> put object 0 on machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 1 on machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 2 on machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 3 on machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n\n---\n\nCome up with some hypothesis about how the world works. Write each one as a python function. The function should:\n- Take as input a numpy boolean vector of length 8, where 0 means object is on floor, and 1 means object is on machine\n- Output a boolean, where 0 means machine light is off, and 1 means machine light is on\n- First construct a boolean mask indicating which object(s) are blickets, extract just the state of these objects, then define some function over these states to produce the state of the machine.\n- Only consider hypothesis where one or all objects that are blickets needs to be put on the machine.\n- Do not consider the \"sum\" operation. Only consider boolean operations.\n\nProduce 49 hypothesis, do not generate the same hypothesis. Be diverse in both the blicket masks and the potential functions.\n\n\nDo not generate the hypothesis you have already eliminated: \ndef h31(state): mask\ndef h0(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h1(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0];

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 8 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor, object 4 is on the floor, object 5 is on the floor, object 6 is on the floor, object 7 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting.

Be diverse in both the blicket masks and the potential functions.\n\n\nDo not generate the hypothesis you have already eliminated: \ndef h31(state): mask\ndef h0(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h1(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h2(state): mask = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h3(state): mask = [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h4(state): mask = [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h5(state): mask = [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h6(state): mask = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h7(state): mask = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h8(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h10(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h12(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h14(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h16(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h18(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h20(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h22(state): mask = [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h24(state): mask = [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h26(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h28(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h30(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h9(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h11(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h13(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h15(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h17(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h19(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h21(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h23(state): mask = [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h25(state): mask = [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h27(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h29(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h32(state): mask = [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h33(state): mask = [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h34(state): mask = [1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h35(state): mask = [1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h36(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h37(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h38(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h39(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h40(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h41(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h42(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h43(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h44(state): mask = [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h45(state): mask = [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h46(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h47(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h48(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h49(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h50(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h51(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h52(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h53(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h54(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h55(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h56(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h57(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h58(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h59(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h60(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h61(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]; return np.all(state[mask])\ndef h62(state): mask = [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]; return np.any(state[mask])\ndef h63(state):\n    mask = [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0]  #
