Each hypothesis is defined by a boolean mask indicating which objects are blickets and a boolean function (either \"all\" or \"any\") that determines if the machine turns on based on the state of these blickets.\n\n### Approach\nThe key steps to generate the hypotheses are:\n1. **Identify New Masks**: Create masks that have not been used in the previously generated hypotheses. This includes pairs and triples of objects that were not covered earlier.\n2. **Apply Boolean Functions**: For each new mask, define two hypotheses using the \"all\" and \"any\" boolean functions. The \"all\" function requires all specified blickets to be on the machine, while the \"any\" function requires at least one of them to be on.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef hypothesis_32(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_33(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_34(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_35(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_36(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_37(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_38(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_39(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_40(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_41(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_42(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_43(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_44(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_45(state): mask = np.array([0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_46(state): mask = np.array([1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_47(state): mask = np.array([1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_48(state): mask = np.array([0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_49(state): mask = np.array([0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_50(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_51(state): mask = np.array([0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_52(state): mask = np.array([1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.all(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_53(state): mask = np.array([1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0], bool); return np.any(state[mask])\ndef hypothesis_54(state): mask = np.array([0,1,0,1,0,", "hyp_usage": {"completion_tokens": 5684, "prompt_tokens": 1787, "total_tokens": 7471, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 512, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 1275}, "hyp_api_error": "false", "hyp_parse_error": "false"}

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
