Each hypothesis is a function that takes a boolean vector representing the objects on the machine and returns whether the machine's light is on. The key is to ensure each hypothesis uses a unique combination of objects (blickets) and applies either the \"any\" or \"all\" boolean operation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Unique Combinations**: We need to create masks (combinations of objects) that haven't been used in previous hypotheses. These masks can vary in the number of objects and their positions.\n2. **Boolean Operations**: For each unique mask, apply both the \"any\" and \"all\" operations to generate two hypotheses, unless the mask has only one object (in which case only \"any\" is relevant).\n3. **Diversity in Masks**: Ensure the masks are diverse, covering different numbers of objects and positions to explore various potential rules for the machine.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef hypothesis_203(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_204(state): mask = [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_205(state): mask = [0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_206(state): mask = [0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_207(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_208(state): mask = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_209(state): mask = [0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_210(state): mask = [0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_211(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_212(state): mask = [1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_213(state): mask = [0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_214(state): mask = [0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_215(state): mask = [1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_216(state): mask = [1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_217(state): mask = [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_218(state): mask = [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_219(state): mask = [1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_220(state): mask = [1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_221(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_222(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_223(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef hypothesis_224(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].all())\ndef hypothesis_225(state): mask = [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1]; return bool(np.array(state)[mask].any())\ndef", "hyp_usage": {"completion_tokens": 3794, "prompt_tokens": 7552, "total_tokens": 11346, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 832, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 6720}, "hyp_api_error": "false", "hyp_parse_error": "false"}

Only consider boolean operations.\n\nProduce 29 hypothesis, do not generate the same hypothesis.

Only consider boolean operations.\n\nProduce 29 hypothesis, do not generate the same hypothesis.

The light on the machine is currently off.\n> look\nYou are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 8 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on the floor, object 4 is on the floor, object 5 is on the floor, object 6 is on the floor, object 7 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 0 on machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 1 on machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 2 on machine\nYou put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 3 on machine\nYou put object 3 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 4 on machine\nYou put object 4 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 5 on machine\nYou put object 5 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 6 on machine\nYou put object 6 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 7 on machine\nYou put object 7 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 0 off machine\nYou took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n> take object 7 off machine\nYou took object 7 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 7 on machine\nYou put object 7 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n\n---\n\nCome up with some hypothesis about how the world works. Write each one as a python function. The function should:\n- Take as input a numpy boolean vector of length 8, where 0 means object is on floor, and 1 means object is on machine\n- Output a boolean, where 0 means machine light is off, and 1 means machine light is on\n- First construct a boolean mask indicating which object(s) are blickets, extract just the state of these objects, then define some function over these states to produce the state of the machine.\n- Only consider hypothesis where one or all objects that are blickets needs to be put on the machine.\n- Do not consider the \"sum\" operation. Only consider boolean operations.\n\nProduce 29 hypothesis, do not generate the same hypothesis. Be diverse in both the blicket masks and the potential functions.\n\n\nDo not generate the hypothesis you have already eliminated: \ndef hypothesis_29(state): mask = [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0];\ndef hypothesis_0(state): mask = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];

You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
