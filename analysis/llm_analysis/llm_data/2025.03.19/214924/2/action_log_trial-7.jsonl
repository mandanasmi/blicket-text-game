You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

When object 3 is on the machine, the light turns on, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n2. When object 7 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on, indicating object 7 is a blicket.\n3. When object 7 is removed, the light turns off, unless object 3 is on the machine, which further supports that object 7 is a blicket.\n4. Object 5 does not turn on the machine by itself, but when object 7 is on the machine, the light turns on, suggesting a potential interaction rule involving object 7.\n\nGiven these observations, object 7 consistently turns the machine on when placed on it, either alone or in combination with other objects.
