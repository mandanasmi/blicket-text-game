Object 6 was placed on the machine with object 7, and the light remained on, but when object 7 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 6 alone does not turn on the machine.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that both objects 5 and 7 can independently turn on the machine, as the light turns on when either is placed on the machine alone. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
