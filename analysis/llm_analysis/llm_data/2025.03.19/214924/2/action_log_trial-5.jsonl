When removed, the machine remained on, indicating object 3 is not a blicket.\n5. Objects 4, 5, 6, and 7 all turn the machine on when placed on it.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that objects 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are likely blickets, as they all turn the machine on when placed on it. Object 1 does not turn the machine on, and object 3 was initially on the machine when it was off, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\nThe hypothesis that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it is consistent with the observations. To further test this hypothesis, we should try to isolate the effect of one of the objects that we suspect is a blicket. Since object 1 is the only one that did not turn the machine on, we can use it to test the effect of other objects.\n\nTo confirm the hypothesis, let's test object 4, which turned the machine on when placed on it.
