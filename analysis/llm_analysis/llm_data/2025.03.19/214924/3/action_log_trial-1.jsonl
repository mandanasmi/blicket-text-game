This will help us determine if object 6 is a blicket by itself, which would eliminate many other hypotheses.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to remove all objects except object 6 and see if the machine remains on.

This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n   - When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.

When both are on, the machine is on, and when both are off, the machine is off.\n\n3. **Analyzing Object 4:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine initially, and the light remained off.
