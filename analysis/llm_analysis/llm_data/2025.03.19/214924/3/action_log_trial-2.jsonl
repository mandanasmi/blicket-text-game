This suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 7 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Hypotheses:**\n   - The machine turns on if object 1 is on it.\n   - The machine turns on if object 6 is on it.\n   - The machine turns on if any of objects 1 or 6 are on it.\n   - The machine turns on if object 1 or object 6 is on it, regardless of other objects.\n\n3. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine multiple times, and each time the light did not turn on unless object 1, 6, or 7 was also on the machine.\n   - This indicates that object 3 alone does not have the property to turn on the machine, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the observations, object 3 does not cause the machine to turn on when placed alone. The machine only turns on with object 3 when other known blickets (like object 1, 6, or 7) are present.\n   - Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
