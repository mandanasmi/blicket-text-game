Adding objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 did not turn the machine on.\n4.

Initially, objects 5 and 7 were on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. After removing objects 5 and 7, the light remained off.\n3. Adding objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 did not turn the light on.\n4. Adding object 6 turned the light on, even when other objects were on the machine.\n5.

This supports the hypothesis that the machine turns on if a specific object (object 6) is on it, regardless of other objects.\n\nTherefore, the current hypothesis is consistent with the observations, and no new hypothesis is needed.
