This suggests that none of these objects alone are sufficient to turn on the machine, which helps us eliminate some hypotheses.\n\nLet's consider the remaining hypotheses:\n\n1.

If the machine turns on, it would suggest that object 7 can contribute to turning the machine on in combination with other objects, which would mean it has some blicket properties.

This suggests that object 4 is indeed a blicket that can turn the machine on by itself.\n\n2. **Hypothesis: The machine turns on if object 7 is placed on it, regardless of other objects.**\n   - This hypothesis is inconsistent with the observations. When object 7 is placed on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. Additionally, when object 7 is on the machine with other objects, the light only turns on when object 4 is also present. Therefore, object 7 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\nBased on these analyses, we can eliminate the hypothesis that the machine turns on if object 7 is placed on it, regardless of other objects.
