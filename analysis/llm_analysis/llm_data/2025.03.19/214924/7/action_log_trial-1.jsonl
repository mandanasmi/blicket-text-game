Therefore, this hypothesis can be eliminated.\n\n- **The machine turns on if an odd number of blickets are on it**: This hypothesis is inconsistent with Observation 4, where the machine is on with 4 objects (an even number).

However, it is inconsistent with Observation 3, where the machine is on with 5 objects (an odd number).

This supports the hypothesis that object 4 is a specific object that can turn on the machine.\n\n2. **The machine turns on if objects with a specific property (e.g., color, shape) are on it.**\n   - Observation: The machine turns on with object 4 on it, but not with objects 0, 1, 2, or 3. This could suggest that object 4 has a specific property that turns on the machine. This hypothesis is still plausible.\n\n3. **The machine turns on if a specific object is on it and another specific object is not on it.**\n   - Observation: The machine turns on with object 4 on it, regardless of the presence of other objects. This suggests that the presence of object 4 alone is sufficient to turn on the machine, so this hypothesis is less likely. However, we cannot completely rule it out without further testing.\n\nBased on the observations, we can eliminate the third hypothesis because the presence of object 4 alone seems to be sufficient to turn on the machine, and there is no evidence that another specific object needs to be absent.\n\nWe can add a new hypothesis based on the observations:\n\n- The machine turns on if object 4 is on it.\n\nThus, the updated list of hypotheses is:\n\n> [\"The machine turns on if a specific object is on it, regardless of other objects.\", \"The machine turns on if objects with a specific property (e.g., color, shape) are on it.\", \"The machine turns on if object 4 is on it.\"]", "hyp_usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 1068, "total_tokens": 1453}, "hyp_space": ["The machine turns on if a specific object is on it, regardless of other objects.", "The machine turns on if objects with a specific property (e.g., color, shape) are on it.", "The machine turns on if object 4 is on it."], "hyp_api_error": "false", "hyp_parse_error": "false", "act_prompt": "You have seen the following observations so far:\n\nYou are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
