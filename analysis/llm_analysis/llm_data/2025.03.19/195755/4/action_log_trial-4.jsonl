This suggests that object 7's effect can be negated by certain other objects.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that object 7 is a blicket but its effect is negated by certain other objects, we should try to identify which object(s) negate its effect. Since object 3 was able to turn the machine on with object 7, it might not be the negating object. We should test other objects with object 7 to see if they negate its effect.\n\nLet's test object 4 with object 7, as object 4 was not tested with object 7 when the machine was on.\n\n> put object 4 on machine", "act_usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 1288, "total_tokens": 1539}, "act_api_error": "false", "act_parse_error": "false"}

When object 7 is placed on the machine with object 3 or object 6, the light turns on.\n3. Object 3 and object 6, when placed on the machine alone, do not turn the light on.\n4. The light turns on when object 3 or object 6 is on the machine with object 7.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 7 alone does not have the ability to turn the machine on, but it does contribute to turning the machine on when combined with object 3 or object 6.
