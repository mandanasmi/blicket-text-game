Object 2 does not turn the machine on by itself, so it is not a blicket. The hypothesis that the machine turns on if object 1 or object 2 is on it is incorrect because object 2 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\nTo further confirm the hypothesis that object 1 is the only blicket, we should test object 1 with another object that has not been tested with it yet. This will help confirm that object 1 is indeed the blicket and that no other object affects the machine when combined with object 1.\n\nLet's test object 1 with object 0, which was initially on the machine but hasn't been tested with object 1 yet.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "act_usage": {"completion_tokens": 280, "prompt_tokens": 1256, "total_tokens": 1536}, "act_api_error": "false", "act_parse_error": "false"}
