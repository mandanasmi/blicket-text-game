This suggests that object 5 is indeed a blicket, as it appears to be the only object that consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it.\n\nThe hypothesis that \"The machine turns on when object 5 is on it\" aligns with the observed behavior. There is no evidence from the observations that contradicts this hypothesis. Other objects, when placed on the machine, do not turn it on, except for object 6, which seems to have no effect when object 5 is not present.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, object 5 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
