When either object 2 or object 6 is removed, the machine turns off. This suggests that both objects are necessary for the machine to turn on. \n\nLet's evaluate the hypotheses:\n\n1. \"The machine turns on only when both object 2 and object 6 are on it.\" - This hypothesis is consistent with the observations.\n2. \"The machine requires at least two specific objects to turn on, and those objects are 2 and 6.\" - This hypothesis is consistent with the observations.\n3. \"Object 2 and object 6 are both blickets, and the machine turns on when both are present.\" - This hypothesis is consistent with the observations.\n4. \"The machine turns on when a specific combination of objects is present, and that combination includes object 2 and object 6.\" - This hypothesis is consistent with the observations.\n5. \"The machine turns on when a specific pair of objects is on it, and that pair is objects 2 and 6.\" - This hypothesis is consistent with the observations.\n\nAll hypotheses are consistent with the observations.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
