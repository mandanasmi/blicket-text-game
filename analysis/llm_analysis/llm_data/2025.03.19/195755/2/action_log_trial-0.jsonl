The machine turns on when object 7 is on it.\n3. The machine does not turn on with objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 alone.\n\nThe current hypothesis is that the machine turns on if object 6 or object 7 is on it. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations so far.\n\nTo further test this hypothesis, we should consider whether the machine requires both objects 6 and 7 to be on it to turn on, or if either one alone is sufficient. However, the observations already show that the machine turns on with either object 6 or object 7 alone, so we know that each of these objects is a blicket.\n\nTo confirm that no other objects are blickets, we should test combinations of other objects with either object 6 or object 7. However, since the machine turns on with either object 6 or object 7 alone, adding other objects should not affect the outcome.\n\nTo further confirm the hypothesis, we can test if the machine turns on with both objects 6 and 7 on it, which would confirm that both are indeed blickets and that the rule is \"the machine turns on if object 6 or object 7 is on it.\"\n\nSince we have already tested object 6 and object 7 individually, and the machine turned on in both cases, we can conclude that both are blickets. The rule is likely that the machine turns on if either object 6 or object 7 is on it.\n\nTo ensure completeness, let's test the machine with both objects 6 and 7 on it to confirm that the machine still turns on, which would further support the hypothesis.\n\n> put object 6 on machine", "act_usage": {"completion_tokens": 379, "prompt_tokens": 886, "total_tokens": 1265}, "act_api_error": "false", "act_parse_error": "false"}

Object 2 was on the machine initially, but the machine was off. However, it was later put on the machine with object 7, and the machine was on. We need to confirm that object 2 alone does not turn on the machine.\n\n- We should also confirm that the machine does not turn on with any combination of objects that does not include object 6 or object 7.\n\nTo maximally reduce the hypothesis space, we should test object 2 in isolation to confirm that it is not a blicket.

However, this does not necessarily mean object 2 is a blicket, as the light was already on due to the presence of object 6 or 7.\n   - When object 2 was on the machine without object 6 or 7, the light was off.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine, the light also turns on. This suggests that object 7 might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Testing with Object 7:**\n   - When object 7 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on. This indicates that object 7 has the ability to turn on the machine by itself, which is a characteristic of a blicket.\n\n3. **Hypothesis:**\n   - The current hypothesis is that the machine turns on if object 6 or object 7 is on it. This hypothesis aligns with the observations where the machine turns on with either object 6 or object 7.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 7 can independently turn on the machine, it fits the definition of a blicket according to the observations and the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, based on the observations and the hypothesis, object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
