This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n- When object 4 is on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests object 4 is a blicket.\n- When object 5 is on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests object 5 is a blicket.\n- When object 6 is on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n- When object 1, 2, 3, or 7 are on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n\nSpecifically for object 7:\n- When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light did not turn on.
