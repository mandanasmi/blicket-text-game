The machine stayed off when object 2 was added.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 1 is a blicket, as it is the only object that, when placed on the machine, turned it on. The hypothesis that the machine turns on only when a specific object is on it is supported by the fact that the machine turned on with object 1 and off when object 1 was removed.\n\nTo further test this hypothesis and ensure that object 1 is indeed the only blicket, I should test another object that hasn't been tested yet. This will help confirm whether object 1 is the only blicket or if there are other objects that can also turn the machine on.\n\n> put object 3 on machine", "act_usage": {"completion_tokens": 234, "prompt_tokens": 649, "total_tokens": 883}, "act_api_error": "false", "act_parse_error": "false"}
