You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Only the object identities matter for whether or not the machine turns on.\n- At each step, you will be provided with observations up to the current step, including previous actions ('> action') and outcomes of the actions. \n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
