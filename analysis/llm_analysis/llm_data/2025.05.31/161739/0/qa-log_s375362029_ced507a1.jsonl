Blickets are objects that have \"blicktness\" which makes the machine turn on according to some hidden rule.\n\nFirst, let's note the initial state:\n- Objects on the machine: only object 5.\n- The light is off.\n\nThen, the agent performs a series of actions. We need to look for when the machine turns on and off to infer the rule.\n\nKey events:\n\n1. The machine turns on for the first time when object 6 is placed on the machine (after a series of placements and removals). Specifically:\n   - After putting object 6 on the machine (with objects 5, 7, 2, 3, 1, 0, 4 already on? Let's track the state step by step).\n\nLet's reconstruct the state of the machine at each step:\n\nInitial: \n  Machine: [5] -> light off\n\nAction: put 7 -> Machine: [5,7] -> off\nAction: put 2 -> Machine: [5,7,2] -> off\nAction: put 3 -> Machine: [5,7,2,3] -> off\nAction: put 1 -> Machine: [5,7,2,3,1] -> off\nAction: put 0 -> Machine: [5,7,2,3,1,0] -> off\nAction: put 4 -> Machine: [5,7,2,3,1,0,4] -> off\nAction: take 2 off -> Machine: [5,7,3,1,0,4] -> off\nAction: put 6 -> Machine: [5,7,3,1,0,4,6] -> light turns ON.\n\nSo when object 6 is added to the set {5,7,3,1,0,4}, the machine turns on.\n\nThen:\nAction: take 5 off -> Machine: [7,3,1,0,4,6] -> light still on\nAction: take 0 off -> Machine: [7,3,1,4,6] -> light on\nAction: take 7 off -> Machine: [3,1,4,6] -> light on\nAction: take 3 off -> Machine: [1,4,6] -> light on\nAction: take 4 off -> Machine: [1,6] -> light turns OFF.\n\nSo when we remove object 4, the light turns off. This suggests that object 4 might be critical? But note that the set when the light turned off was [1,6]. Then:\n\nAction: take 6 off -> Machine: [1] -> off (remains off)\n\nThen the agent puts 3 -> Machine: [1,3] -> off\nThen puts 0 -> Machine: [1,3,0] -> off\nThen takes 1 off -> Machine: [3,0] -> off\nThen puts 5 -> Machine: [3,0,5] -> off\nThen takes 0 off -> Machine: [3,5] -> off\nThen puts 7 -> Machine: [3,5,7] -> off\nThen puts 2 -> Machine: [3,5,7,2] -> off\nThen takes 7 off -> Machine: [3,5,2] -> off\nThen puts 7 -> Machine: [3,5,2,7] -> off\nThen puts 0 -> Machine: [3,5,2,7,0] -> off\nThen takes 7 off -> Machine: [3,5,2,0] -> off\nThen puts 4 -> Machine: [3,5,2,0,4] -> off\nThen puts 6 -> Machine: [3,5,2,0,4,6] -> light turns ON again.\n\nNotice that in the first activation, the set was {5,7,3,1,0,4,6} without 2 (because 2 was removed earlier). Then in the second activation, the set is {3,5,2,0,4,6}. The common objects in both activations are 3,4,5,6,0? But wait, 5 was present in the first but not in the second? Let's see:\n\nFirst activation set: {5,7,3,1,0,4,6} -> without 2 (removed) and with 1,7,5.\nSecond activation set: {3,5,2,0,4,6} -> without 1 and 7.\n\nBut note that in the second activation, the machine turns on when 6 is added to {3,5,2,0,4}.

Machine off.\n\n1. Put 7 on machine -> off\n2. Put 2 on machine -> off\n3. Put 3 on machine -> off\n4. Put 1 on machine -> off\n5. Put 0 on machine -> off\n6. Put 4 on machine -> off   [Now machine has 0,1,2,3,4,5,7? Wait, let's track: initially 5 was on. Then added 7,2,3,1,0,4. So now: 0,1,2,3,4,5,7 -> off]\n7. Take 2 off -> off   [Now: 0,1,3,4,5,7]\n8. Put 6 on machine -> on   [Now: 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 -> on]\n\nAt step 8: putting 6 on turns the machine on. So the set {0,1,3,4,5,6,7} turns it on? But note that we just added 6 and it turned on.\n\nBut then:\n\n9. Take 5 off -> on   [Now: 0,1,3,4,6,7 -> on]\n10. Take 0 off -> on   [Now: 1,3,4,6,7 -> on]\n11.

Take 4 off -> off   [Now: 1,6 -> off]\n\nSo when we remove 4 (and also 3 and 7 and 0 and 5 had been removed earlier) and we are left with only 1 and 6, the machine turns off. So the set {1,6} does not turn the machine on? But note that in step 8 we had a lot of objects and it turned on only when we added 6.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the minimal set that turned it on.\n\nAfter step 8: we have {0,1,3,4,5,6,7} and the machine is on.\n\nThen we remove objects one by one and the machine remains on until we remove 4 (at step 13). After removing 4, we have {1,6} and the machine turns off.\n\nSo the set {1,6} is not sufficient? But then what is the critical set?\n\nNow, after step 13, the machine is off. Then:\n\n14. Take 6 off -> off   [Now: 1 -> off]   (step 14: take object 6 off -> off, so now only 1 is on? But step 13 already turned off when we took 4 off, so step 14 doesn't change.)\n\nActually step 13: we take 4 off and the machine turns off. Then step 14: take 6 off -> still off.

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nRecall: The machine turns on when certain conditions are met regarding the blickets on it. We don't know the rule, so we must infer from the actions and the machine's responses.\n\nLet's break down the interactions step by step, noting the state of the machine (light on/off) and the objects on the machine at each step.\n\nInitial state:\n- Machine: off\n- Objects on machine: only object 5 (since initially object 5 is on top of the machine, and others are on the floor)\n\nStep 1: put object 7 on the machine -> light off\n- Now on machine: 5,7\n- Light off\n\nStep 2: put object 2 on the machine -> light off\n- Now: 5,7,2 -> off\n\nStep 3: put object 3 on the machine -> off\n- Now: 5,7,2,3 -> off\n\nStep 4: put object 1 on the machine -> off\n- Now: 5,7,2,3,1 -> off\n\nStep 5: put object 0 on the machine -> off\n- Now: 5,7,2,3,1,0 -> off\n\nStep 6: put object 4 on the machine -> off\n- Now: 5,7,2,3,1,0,4 -> off\n\nStep 7: take object 2 off -> off\n- Now: 5,7,3,1,0,4 -> off\n\nStep 8: put object 6 on the machine -> light turns ON\n- Now: 5,7,3,1,0,4,6 -> ON\n\nAt this point, the machine turns on when object 6 is added. So we suspect that object 6 is a blicket and that its addition caused the activation.\n\nBut note: the machine was off with objects [5,7,3,1,0,4] and then adding 6 turned it on.\n\nNow, let's see subsequent steps:\n\nStep 9: take object 5 off -> still ON\n- Now: 7,3,1,0,4,6 -> ON\n\nStep 10: take object 0 off -> still ON\n- Now: 7,3,1,4,6 -> ON\n\nStep 11: take object 7 off -> still ON\n- Now: 3,1,4,6 -> ON\n\nStep 12: take object 3 off -> still ON\n- Now: 1,4,6 -> ON\n\nStep 13: take object 4 off -> light turns OFF\n- Now: 1,6 -> OFF\n\nThis is critical: when we remove object 4, the light turns off. So with objects [1,6] the machine is off.\n\nStep 14: take object 6 off -> off (as expected, since it was already off)\n\nBut then the agent continues:\n\nStep 15: put object 3 on -> off\n- Now: 1,3 -> off\n\nStep 16: put object 0 on -> off\n- Now: 1,3,0 -> off\n\nStep 17: take object 1 off -> off\n- Now: 3,0 -> off\n\nStep 18: put object 5 on -> off\n- Now: 3,0,5 -> off\n\nStep 19: take object 0 off -> off\n- Now: 3,5 -> off\n\nStep 20: put object 7 on -> off\n- Now: 3,5,7 -> off\n\nStep 21: put object 2 on -> off\n- Now: 3,5,7,2 -> off\n\nStep 22: take object 7 off -> off\n- Now: 3,5,2 -> off\n\nStep 23: put object 7 on -> off\n- Now: 3,5,2,7 -> off\n\nStep 24: put object 0 on -> off\n- Now: 3,5,2,7,0 -> off\n\nStep 25: take object 7 off -> off\n- Now: 3,5,2,0 -> off\n\nStep 26: put object 4 on -> off\n- Now: 3,5,2,0,4 -> off\n\nStep 27: put object 6 on -> light turns ON\n- Now: 3,5,2,0,4,6 -> ON\n\nAgain, when object 6 is added, the machine turns on.\n\nNow, let's try to deduce the rule and which objects are blickets.\n\nFrom the critical steps:\n\n1.

We need to determine if object 7 is a blicket. Blickets are objects that have \"blicktness\" which can make the machine turn on following a hidden rule.\n\nFirst, let's note the initial state:\n- Objects on the machine: only object 5 (at the beginning).\n- The light is off.\n\nWe then observe a series of actions and the machine's response.\n\nKey moments:\n\n1. The agent puts objects 7, 2, 3, 1, 0, 4 one by one on the machine. The light remains off.\n   - At this point, the machine has: objects 5 (initial), and then 7, 2, 3, 1, 0, 4 added. So the machine has objects 5,7,2,3,1,0,4. The light is off.\n\n2. The agent takes object 2 off. Light remains off.\n\n3. The agent puts object 6 on the machine. Then the light turns on.\n   - So after putting object 6, the machine has: 5,7,3,1,0,4,6 (since 2 was removed). The light turns on.\n\n4. Then the agent takes off objects 5, 0, 7, 3, 4, and then 6. The light remains on until after taking object 4 off, then turning off when object 4 is removed? Let's check:\n   - After taking off 5: light remains on -> machine has 7,3,1,0,4,6\n   - After taking off 0: light remains on -> machine has 7,3,1,4,6\n   - After taking off 7: light remains on -> machine has 3,1,4,6\n   - After taking off 3: light remains on -> machine has 1,4,6\n   - After taking off 4: light turns off -> machine has 1,6\n   - Then taking off 6: light remains off -> machine has only 1.\n\n   This suggests that when object 4 is removed, the light turns off. So the presence of object 4 was necessary to keep the light on? Or perhaps the rule is about a specific set.\n\n5. Then the agent puts object 3 on (machine: 1,3) -> light off.\n\n6. Puts object 0 on (machine: 1,3,0) -> light off.\n\n7. Takes object 1 off (machine: 3,0) -> light off.\n\n8. Puts object 5 on (machine: 3,0,5) -> light off.\n\n9. Takes object 0 off (machine: 3,5) -> light off.\n\n10. Puts object 7 on (machine: 3,5,7) -> light off.\n\n11. Puts object 2 on (machine: 3,5,7,2) -> light off.\n\n12. Takes object 7 off (machine: 3,5,2) -> light off.\n\n13. Puts object 7 on (machine: 3,5,2,7) -> light off.\n\n14. Puts object 0 on (machine: 3,5,2,7,0) -> light off.\n\n15. Takes object 7 off (machine: 3,5,2,0) -> light off.\n\n16. Puts object 4 on (machine: 3,5,2,0,4) -> light off.\n\n17. Puts object 6 on (machine: 3,5,2,0,4,6) -> light turns on.\n\nNow, we must infer the rule and which objects are blickets.\n\nNotice that the light turned on in two situations:\n\nFirst time: \n  - Objects on machine: 5,7,3,1,0,4,6 (after adding 6) -> light on.\n  - Then when we remove 4 (leaving 1,6) the light turns off.\n\nSecond time:\n  - Objects on machine: 3,5,2,0,4,6 (after adding 6) -> light on.\n\nIn both cases, object 6 is present and the light turns on when 6 is added. But note that in the first sequence, when 6 was added to the set (5,7,3,1,0,4) the light turned on. Then in the second sequence, when 6 was added to (3,5,2,0,4) the light turned on.\n\nHowever, note that in the first sequence, the machine initially had 5 and then others. Also, when we removed 4, the light turned off even though 6 was still present.
