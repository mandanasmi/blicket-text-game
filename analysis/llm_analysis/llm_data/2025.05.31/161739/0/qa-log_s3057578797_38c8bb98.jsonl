We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what the rule is for the machine turning on.\n\n Recall: The machine turns on when blickets are placed on it, following some hidden rule. We cannot tell by looking, so we must infer from the actions and outcomes.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Track the state of the machine (on/off) after each action.\n 2. Note which objects are on the machine at each step and how the state changes.\n\n Important: We must figure out the rule. Common rules might be:\n   - The machine requires at least one blicket to be on it (but note: sometimes the machine stays on even when non-blickets are present?).\n   - More complex rules: perhaps a specific combination, or a minimum number.\n\n However, from the interactions, we can see that sometimes the machine turns off even when multiple objects are on it, and sometimes it stays on when objects are removed.\n\n Let's reconstruct the sequence of events and the state of the machine:\n\n Initial state:\n   Objects on machine: only object 5 (since initially, object 5 is on top of the machine, others are on the floor). Machine light is off.\n\n But note: the initial description says the light is off. So with only object 5 on the machine, the machine is off.\n\n Action 1: put object 1 on the machine -> light remains off.\n   Now on machine: 5 and 1 -> off\n\n Action 2: put object 0 on the machine -> light turns on.\n   Now on machine: 5, 1, 0 -> on\n\n So adding object 0 turned the machine on. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket? But note that object 5 and 1 were already on and the machine was off.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the rule requires a specific set? Or perhaps object 5 is not a blicket and object 0 is.\n\n Action 3: take object 5 off -> light remains on.\n   Now on machine: 1 and 0 -> on\n\n Action 4: take object 1 off -> light remains on.\n   Now on machine: only 0 -> on\n\n This suggests that with only object 0, the machine is on. So object 0 is a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself? But then why did the machine turn on only when we added 0 to 5 and 1? It could be that 0 is the only blicket so far.\n\n Action 5: put object 5 on -> light remains on.\n   Now on machine: 0 and 5 -> on\n\n Action 6: put object 1 on -> light remains on.\n   Now: 0,5,1 -> on\n\n Action 7: put object 4 on -> light remains on.\n   Now: 0,5,1,4 -> on\n\n Action 8: take object 0 off -> light turns off.\n   Now: 5,1,4 -> off\n\n This is critical: when we remove object 0, the machine turns off even though 5,1,4 are still on. This suggests that object 0 is necessary for the machine to be on? Or that without 0, the combination isn't enough.\n\n But note: after removing 0, we have 5,1,4 on the machine and the machine is off.\n\n Then:\n Action 9: put object 6 on -> still off.\n   Now: 5,1,4,6 -> off\n\n Action 10: put object 3 on -> still off.\n   Now: 5,1,4,6,3 -> off\n\n Action 11: put object 7 on -> turns on.\n   Now: 5,1,4,6,3,7 -> on\n\n Why did adding 7 turn it on? So object 7 must be a blicket? But note that we had 5,1,4,6,3 and it was off, then adding 7 turned it on. So 7 might be a blicket.\n\n However, we know that object 0 was a blicket because when it was alone the machine was on, and when we removed it the machine turned off even with others.\n\n Now, after adding 7 the machine turns on.

So object 0 alone can keep the machine on? But note that when we first put 0 on, we had 5 and 1 already and then it turned on. Now with only 0, it stays on.\n\n> put object 5 on the machine\n- Added 5 -> objects: 0 and 5 -> light still on\n\n> put object 1 on the machine\n- Added 1 -> objects: 0,5,1 -> light still on\n\n> put object 4 on the machine\n- Added 4 -> objects: 0,5,1,4 -> light still on\n\n> take object 0 off the machine\n- Took off 0 -> objects now: 5,1,4 -> light turns off\n- This is key: removing object 0 causes the machine to turn off, even though 5,1,4 are still on. This suggests that object 0 is critical for the machine to be on. Without it, the machine turns off.\n\n> put object 6 on the machine\n- Added 6 to [5,1,4] -> light remains off\n\n> put object 3 on the machine\n- Added 3 to [5,1,4,6] -> light remains off\n\n> put object 7 on the machine\n- Added 7 to [5,1,4,6,3] -> light turns on\n- This suggests that adding object 7 causes the machine to turn on. But note that object 0 is not present. So object 7 might also be a blicket? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present? But then why did the machine turn off when we removed object 0 earlier?\n\nLet's reconsider: when we had only object 0, the machine was on. Then we added others and it stayed on. When we removed object 0, it turned off. Now we added 7 and it turned on again. So maybe both 0 and 7 are blickets? But then why when we had objects 5,1,4,6,3 (without 0 and 7) the machine was off? And adding 7 turned it on.\n\nSo it seems that the machine requires at least one blicket to be present. Object 0 and object 7 seem to be blickets because they can turn the machine on when added.\n\nBut what about object 5? Let's see:\n\n> put object 0 on the machine (again)\n- Added 0 to [5,1,4,6,3,7] -> light turns on (was already on? The history says \"now on\", but it was on because of the previous step? Actually, the previous step had turned it on by adding 7, so adding 0 doesn't change the state?

Blickets are objects that have \"blicktness\" which can make the machine turn on, but the rule might be complex (e.g., requiring a specific combination).\n\n Let's analyze the interactions step by step to infer the rule and the status of each object.\n\n Initial state: \n   Objects on machine: only object 5 (since it's on top at the start). The light is off.\n\n Step 1: put object 1 on the machine.\n   Machine: [5, 1] -> light remains off.\n\n Step 2: put object 0 on the machine.\n   Machine: [5, 1, 0] -> light turns on.\n   So, the combination of objects 5, 1, and 0 together turned on the machine? But note that object 5 was already on the machine and the light was off until object 0 was added.\n\n Step 3: take object 5 off the machine.\n   Machine: [1, 0] -> light remains on? The output says \"now on\", meaning it was on and remains on? But note: after taking object 5 off, the light is still on. So object 5 might not be necessary when objects 1 and 0 are present? Or maybe the rule is about having at least one blicket? But we don't know.\n\n Step 4: take object 1 off the machine.\n   Machine: [0] -> light remains on? The output says \"now on\", meaning it was on and remains on? But then we have only object 0 and the light is on. This suggests object 0 might be a blicket? But wait, when we started with object 5 on the machine and then added 1 and 0, the light came on. Now with only 0, the light is still on? That would imply object 0 alone can keep the light on? But then why when we added 0 initially (with 5 and 1) it turned on? Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it? But then why was the light off at the beginning with only object 5?\n\n Let's reconsider step 3 and 4:\n\n   Step 3: after taking 5 off, the machine has [1,0] and light is on.\n   Step 4: after taking 1 off, the machine has [0] and light is on.\n\n So object 0 alone is keeping the light on? Then why was the light off when we had only object 5? So object 5 might not be a blicket? Or the rule is more complex.\n\n Step 5: put object 5 back on the machine.\n   Machine: [0,5] -> light remains on (as expected if 0 is a blicket and 5 is not necessary).\n\n Step 6: put object 1 on the machine.\n   Machine: [0,5,1] -> light remains on.\n\n Step 7: put object 4 on the machine.\n   Machine: [0,5,1,4] -> light remains on.\n\n Step 8: take object 0 off the machine.\n   Machine: [5,1,4] -> light turns off.\n\n This is critical: when object 0 is removed, the light turns off even though objects 5,1,4 are still on. This suggests that object 0 is essential for the machine to be on? Or that without object 0, the combination of 5,1,4 is insufficient? Also, note that in step 1 and 2, when we added 1 then 0, the light turned on only when 0 was added. So object 0 seems to be a blicket and necessary.\n\n Step 9: put object 6 on the machine (with machine having [5,1,4] and light off).\n   Machine: [5,1,4,6] -> light remains off.\n\n Step 10: put object 3 on the machine.\n   Machine: [5,1,4,6,3] -> light remains off.\n\n Step 11: put object 7 on the machine.\n   Machine: [5,1,4,6,3,7] -> light turns on.\n\n So adding object 7 made the light turn on. This suggests that object 7 might be a blicket? Or that the combination now includes a blicket? But note that object 0 is not present, and the light turned on when 7 was added. So maybe object 7 is a blicket? But then why didn't the light turn on with 5,1,4? Unless 5,1,4 are not blickets?

But note: after taking object 1 off, the machine has only object 0 and the light is on. This suggests object 0 alone can keep the machine on? Or perhaps there is a rule that doesn't require all to be present?\n\nBut wait: after step 2, we had 5,1,0 and the light turned on. Then removing 5 and then 1, the light remains on. So at step 4, only object 0 is on the machine and the light is on. This implies that object 0 is a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself? However, note that when we put object 0 on in step 2, the light turned on when added to the existing set (which had 1 and 5). Now, when we remove others, the light stays on. This might indicate that once the machine is on, it stays on until a critical object is removed? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine is on if at least one blicket is present? But let's see more.\n\n5. > put object 5 on the machine\n   - Result: light still on (as expected, adding a non-blicket shouldn't change if a blicket is present?

Now objects on machine: 5, 1, 4. After removing object 0, the light turns off. This suggests that object 0 is necessary for the machine to be on at this point? Or that without object 0, there is no blicket?\n\nBut note: in step 4, we had only object 0 and the light was on. Now, when we remove object 0 (with 5,1,4 on the machine) the light goes off. This implies that among the objects on the machine at that time (5,1,4), none is a blicket? Or that the rule requires object 0? \n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine turns on only when a specific set of blickets is present.

Because when we added it, the machine turned on. But note that the machine had been off until then. However, we must consider what the set was. Before adding 7, we had 5,1,4,6,3 and the light was off. Then adding 7 turned it on. So 7 must be a blicket? Or maybe the combination of 7 and some other?
