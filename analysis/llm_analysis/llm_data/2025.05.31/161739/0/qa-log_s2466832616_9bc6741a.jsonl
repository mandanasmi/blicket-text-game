Blickets are objects that have \"blicktness\" which makes the machine turn on according to some rule.\n\nLet's analyze the interactions step by step to infer the rule and which objects are blickets.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: object 0 (already on the machine at the start)\n- Light is off.\n\nSequence of actions and outcomes:\n\n1. Put object 4 on machine -> light remains off.\n   - Machine: 0,4 -> off\n\n2. Put object 1 on machine -> light remains off.\n   - Machine: 0,4,1 -> off\n\n3.

Put object 5 on machine -> light turns on.\n   - Machine: 0,4,1,3,5 -> on\n\n   This suggests that the addition of object 5 caused the machine to turn on. Therefore, object 5 must be a blicket. But note: the machine was off before and now it's on, so at least one blicket is present. However, it might be that the rule requires a specific combination.\n\n5. Take object 1 off -> light remains on.\n   - Machine: 0,4,3,5 -> on\n\n6. Take object 0 off -> light remains on.\n   - Machine: 4,3,5 -> on\n\n7. Take object 4 off -> light turns off.\n   - Machine: 3,5 -> off\n\n   This is critical. When object 4 was removed, the machine turned off. This suggests that object 4 is necessary for the machine to stay on in this configuration? Or note that when we remove object 4, the set becomes {3,5} and the light goes off. But when we had {0,4,1,3,5} and then removed 1 and 0, leaving {4,3,5} the light was on. Then removing 4 leaves {3,5} and the light goes off.\n\n8. Put object 7 on -> light remains off.\n   - Machine: 3,5,7 -> off\n\n9. Take object 7 off -> light remains off.\n   - Machine: 3,5 -> off\n\n10. Put object 2 on -> light remains off.\n    - Machine: 3,5,2 -> off\n\n11. Take object 3 off -> light remains off.\n    - Machine: 5,2 -> off\n\n12. Put object 4 on -> light turns on.\n    - Machine: 5,2,4 -> on\n\n    This is the key: with objects 5, 2, and 4 on the machine, the light turns on. But note that when we had 3,5,2 the light was off. And when we put 4 on (with 5 and 2 already there) the light turns on.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the rule:\n\nFrom step 4: Adding object 5 to {0,4,1,3} turned the machine on. But note that after removing 1 and 0 (step 5 and 6) the machine remained on with {4,3,5}. Then removing 4 (step 7) turned it off. So the set {3,5} is not sufficient to turn the machine on? But then in step 12, putting 4 back on with {5,2} turned it on.\n\nAlso note step 12: The machine had objects 5 and 2 (after step 10 and 11). Then adding 4 turned the machine on. So the set {2,5,4} turns the machine on.\n\nBut in step 4, the set {0,4,1,3,5} turned the machine on. Then when we removed 1 and 0, we still had {4,3,5} and the machine stayed on. Then removing 4 turned it off. So 4 is critical? But then in step 12, we see that {2,5,4} turns it on.\n\nWhat about object 3? In step 7, when we had {3,5} the machine was off. Then we added 7 and 2 and it remained off. Then we removed 3 and it was still off. Then we put 4 and it turned on.\n\nSo it seems that the machine turns on only when both object 4 and object 5 are present? But wait, in step 4, when we added 5 to {0,4,1,3} it turned on. Then when we removed 1 and 0, we still had {4,3,5} and it stayed on.

When the machine had objects 0,4,1,3,5 (after adding 5) the light turned on.\n    - Removing 1 and 0 (which were on the machine) left 4,3,5 and the light remained on.\n    - Then removing 4 caused the light to turn off.

Later, when the machine had only 5 and 2 (after putting 2 and removing 3) the light was off.\n    - Then adding 4 (so now 5,2,4) caused the light to turn on again.\n\n 3. In the first successful configuration (with 0,4,1,3,5) we note that removing 4 turned the light off, and in the second successful configuration (5,2,4) adding 4 turned it on.\n\n 4. Therefore, object 4 seems to be a blicket and necessary for the machine to turn on? But note that when we had 4,3,5 the light was on, but then we removed 4 and it turned off.

Then we removed non-4 objects and the light stayed on until 4 was removed.\n\n 6. Let's consider if the rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on the machine? But note that when we had 4,3,5 (and the light was on) and then we removed 4, leaving 3 and 5, the light turned off. That suggests that 3 and 5 alone are not enough? But wait, when we had 3,5,7 the light was off? Actually, we had 3,5,7 and the light was off. Then we removed 7 (so 3,5) and the light remained off.

Or that the combination without 4 is insufficient.\n\nNow, after that:\n> put object 7 on the machine\n  Now on machine: [3,5,7]\n  Light: off\n\n> take object 7 off the machine\n  Now on machine: [3,5]\n  Light: off (unchanged)\n\n> put object 2 on the machine\n  Now on machine: [3,5,2]\n  Light: off\n\n> take object 3 off the machine\n  Now on machine: [5,2]   (removed 3)\n  Light: off\n\n> put object 4 on the machine\n  Now on machine: [5,2,4]\n  Light: turns on\n\nSo, when we put object 4 back (with objects 5 and 2), the machine turns on.\n\nLet's try to figure out the rule. The machine turns on when a certain condition is met. We have two instances where the machine turns on:\n\n1. When we added object 5 to the set [0,4,1,3] (which was off) to get [0,4,1,3,5] -> on.\n2. When we added object 4 to the set [5,2] (which was off) to get [5,2,4] -> on.\n\nAlso note that when we had [4,3,5] the machine was on, but when we removed 4 (leaving [3,5]) it turned off. And when we had [0,4,1,3] (without 5) it was off.\n\nWe need to see which objects are blickets and what rule might be in place.\n\nPossible rules:\n- Maybe the machine requires at least one blicket? But then why did [0,4,1,3] (which included 0, which was initially on and the machine was off) not turn on? And note that initially only 0 was on and the machine was off. So 0 alone doesn't turn it on.\n\n- Perhaps a specific combination? We see that when 5 is added to a set that doesn't include 5, the machine turns on. But note that when we have [5,2,4] the machine turns on without 0,1,3. So 5 and 4 together might be important.\n\nLet's look at the turning on events:\n\nEvent 1: Adding 5 to [0,4,1,3] -> on. So the set becomes [0,4,1,3,5]. But note that when we remove 1 and 0 (leaving [4,3,5]) it remains on until we remove 4 (then becomes off). So the set [4,3,5] is on, but [3,5] is off.

When object 4 is removed, the light turns off. This suggests that object 4 is necessary for the machine to be on in this configuration? But note that before removing object 4, the machine had objects 4,3,5 and was on. After removing 4, we have 3 and 5 and the light goes off.\n\nStep 8: put object 7 on the machine\n- After: machine has objects 3,5,7 -> light off\n\nStep 9: take object 7 off the machine\n- After: machine has objects 3,5 -> light off (unchanged)\n\nStep 10: put object 2 on the machine\n- After: machine has objects 3,5,2 -> light off\n\nStep 11: take object 3 off the machine\n- After: machine has objects 5,2 -> light off\n\nStep 12: put object 4 on the machine\n- After: machine has objects 5,2,4 -> light turns ON\n\nNow, when object 4 is put back (with objects 5 and 2), the light turns on.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nFrom the first critical point (step 4): when the machine turned on with objects 0,4,1,3,5. Then we removed 1 and 0 and it stayed on until we removed 4 (step 7). Then when we put 4 back in step 12 (with 5 and 2), it turned on again.\n\nAlso note that when we had only 3 and 5 (after step 7) the machine was off. When we added 4 (with 5 and 2) it turned on.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\nPossibly, the machine turns on only when both object 4 and object 5 are on the machine? But in step 4, we had 0,4,1,3,5 and it turned on. Then when we removed everything else except 3 and 5, it was off. Then when we added 4 to 5 and 2, it turned on.\n\nBut note in step 12, we have objects 5,2,4 and the light turns on. We don't know about object 2. However, in step 10, when we put 2 on the machine with 3 and 5, the light did not turn on. So object 2 is probably not a blicket.\n\nAlso, when we had 3 and 5 (without 4) the light was off. Then we added 4 and it turned on. So 4 and 5 together seem to cause the machine to turn on.\n\nBut what about the initial state? Initially, object 0 was on the machine and the light was off. So object 0 alone doesn't turn it on.\n\nNow, let's check the other objects:\n\n- Object 1: was on the machine in the first configuration (with 0,4,1,3,5) and the machine turned on only after adding 5. Then when we removed 1, the machine stayed on. So object 1 is probably not necessary and not a blicket?

But then why did the machine turn on when we added 5? And why did it turn off when we removed 4? Also, note that after step 7, we have [3,5] and the light is off.

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nLet's summarize the state of the machine after each action:\n\nInitial state:\n- Machine: light off\n- Objects on machine: only object 0\n\nAction 1: put object 4 on the machine\n- Now on machine: 0, 4\n- Light: off\n\nAction 2: put object 1 on the machine\n- Now on machine: 0, 4, 1\n- Light: off\n\nAction 3: put object 3 on the machine\n- Now on machine: 0, 4, 1, 3\n- Light: off\n\nAction 4: put object 5 on the machine\n- Now on machine: 0, 4, 1, 3, 5\n- Light turns ON.\n\nSo, after adding object 5, the machine turns on. This suggests that object 5 might be a blicket, but note that the machine might require a specific combination.\n\nAction 5: take object 1 off\n- Now on machine: 0, 4, 3, 5\n- Light: still on\n\nAction 6: take object 0 off\n- Now on machine: 4, 3, 5\n- Light: still on\n\nAction 7: take object 4 off\n- Now on machine: 3, 5\n- Light turns off.\n\nSo, when we remove object 4, the light goes off. This suggests that object 4 is critical for the machine to be on when only 3 and 5 are left? But note that when we had 0,4,1,3,5 the light was on, and after removing 1 and 0 (leaving 4,3,5) the light was still on. Then removing 4 made it go off.\n\nAction 8: put object 7 on\n- Now on machine: 3,5,7\n- Light: off\n\nAction 9: take object 7 off\n- Now on machine: 3,5\n- Light: off (unchanged)\n\nAction 10: put object 2 on\n- Now on machine: 3,5,2\n- Light: off\n\nAction 11: take object 3 off\n- Now on machine: 5,2\n- Light: off\n\nAction 12: put object 4 on\n- Now on machine: 5,2,4\n- Light turns on.\n\nSo, putting object 4 back on the machine (with 5 and 2) turns the light on.\n\nWhat can we infer?\n\nFrom the first time the machine turned on (after putting 5 on the machine) the objects on the machine were 0,4,1,3,5. But then we removed 1 and 0 and the light stayed on until we removed 4. Then when we put 4 back (with 5 and 2) the light came on again.\n\nNotice that in the state when we had 4,3,5 the light was on. Then we removed 4 and it went off. Then we tried adding 7 (to 3,5) and it didn't turn on. Then we added 2 to 3,5 and it didn't turn on. Then we removed 3 (leaving 5,2) and then added 4 to 5,2 and it turned on.\n\nSo it seems that the presence of object 4 and object 5 together is crucial? But note that when we had 4,3,5 the light was on and when we have 4,5,2 the light is on. However, we also had a state with 0,4,1,3,5 and the light was on. So it seems that whenever 4 and 5 are both on the machine, the light is on? But wait, in the state after action 8: we had 3,5,7 and the light was off. Then we added 7 to 3,5 and it didn't turn on. Then we put 2 on (so 3,5,2) and it was off. Then we removed 3 (so 5,2) and then added 4 (so 5,2,4) and it turned on.\n\nSo the light turned on only when 4 and 5 are together? What about the other objects?\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the machine turns on if and only if both object 4 and object 5 are on the machine.\n\nCheck the states:\n\n1. After putting 5 (action 4): objects 0,4,1,3,5 -> has both 4 and 5 -> light on. (matches)\n2.
