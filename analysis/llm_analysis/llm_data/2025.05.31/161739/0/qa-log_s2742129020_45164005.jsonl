Blickets have \"blicktness\" that makes the machine turn on, but I don't know the rule. It could be that all blickets need to be on, or at least one, or some combination. I have to infer from the interactions.\n\nLet me list all the interactions step by step to see when the machine turns on and off. I should track the state of the machine and which objects are on it.\n\nInitial state:\n- Machine light is off.\n- Objects on machine: only object 1 is on the machine at start. Others are on floor.\n\nActions:\n\n1. > put object 5 on the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 1,5\n   - Light: off\n\n2. > put object 6 on the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 1,5,6\n   - Light: off\n\n3. > put object 2 on the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 1,5,6,2\n   - Light: turns on (was off, now on)\n\nSo, adding object 2 made it turn on. But objects 1,5,6 were already on and light was off. So object 2 might be a blicket, or the combination triggered something.\n\n4. > take object 6 off the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 1,5,2\n   - Light: still on (was on, now on)\n\nTaking off 6 didn't turn it off.\n\n5. > take object 1 off the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 5,2\n   - Light: still on\n\nTaking off 1 didn't turn it off.\n\n6. > take object 5 off the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 2\n   - Light: still on\n\nNow only object 2 is on, and light is on. So object 2 alone keeps the light on? But initially, object 1 was on alone and light was off. At start, object 1 was on machine, light off.\n\nInitial: object 1 on machine, light off.\n\nAfter adding 5 and 6, still off. Then adding 2, on.\n\nThen removing 6,5,1, light stays on with only 2.\n\nSo object 2 seems to be a blicket, and it can turn on the light by itself? But why was light off with only 1? Probably object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n7. > put object 1 on the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 2,1\n   - Light: still on\n\n8. > put object 3 on the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 2,1,3\n   - Light: still on\n\nAdding 3 didn't change.\n\n9. > take object 2 off the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 1,3\n   - Light: turns off (was on, now off)\n\nTaking off 2 turned it off. With 1 and 3 on, light off. So neither 1 nor 3 alone or together can keep it on? But object 2 was key.\n\n10. > put object 0 on the machine\n    - After: objects on machine: 1,3,0\n    - Light: turns on (was off, now on)\n\nAdding object 0 made it turn on.

So object 2 is a blicket and by itself can turn on the machine? But note that when we later remove object 2, the machine turns off (we'll see).\n\nHowever, wait: at step 3, when we added object 2 to the set (1,5,6) the machine turned on. Then we removed 6, 1, and 5 and the machine stayed on with only 2. So it seems that object 2 is a blicket and sufficient by itself? But let's see later.\n\n7. > put object 1 on the machine -> light remains on (now 2 and 1 are on machine).\n\n8. > put object 3 on the machine -> light remains on (now 2,1,3).\n\n9. > take object 2 off -> light turns OFF.\n   - Now machine has 1 and 3 -> off.\n\nThis is important: when we remove object 2, the machine turns off. So even though we had objects 1 and 3, without 2 the machine is off. This suggests that object 2 is necessary for the machine to be on in this configuration? But note that earlier with only object 2 the machine was on.\n\n10. > put object 0 on the machine -> light turns ON.\n    - Now machine has 1,3,0 -> on? But without 2? How?\n    - Previously, without 2 (only 1 and 3) the machine was off. Now adding 0 makes it on.\n\n    So what changed? We added object 0. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket and can activate the machine with other non-blickets? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present? But then why was the machine off initially with only object 1? And why when we had 1 and 5 and 6 it was off until we added 2?\n\n    Alternatively, maybe the rule is more complex.\n\n11. > put object 6 on the machine -> light remains on (now 1,3,0,6).\n\n12. > take object 1 off -> light remains on (now 3,0,6).\n\n13. > take object 6 off -> light remains on (now 3,0).\n\n14. > take object 3 off -> light remains on (now only 0).\n\nSo now the machine has only object 0 and the light is on. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket? Because by itself it keeps the machine on.\n\nBut then why was the machine off when we had only object 1 initially? And why when we had 1,5,6 it was off until we added 2? Then when we removed 2, the machine turned off even though 1 and 3 were there? And then when we added 0, it turned on? And then we removed 1,6,3 and left only 0 and it stayed on.\n\nSo object 0 is a blicket. And object 2 is a blicket (because when it was alone the machine was on). What about object 1?\n\nLet's continue:\n\n15. > put object 5 on the machine -> light remains on (now 0 and 5).\n    - We see that adding 5 doesn't turn it off?

This suggests that object 2 alone can turn on the machine? But note that when we put object 2 on in step 3, it turned on a set that included 1,5,6. However, now with only 2, it remains on.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial state? Initially, object 1 was on the machine and the machine was off.

This suggests that object 2 is necessary for the machine to be on when these objects are present? But note that earlier we had the machine on with only object 2. So what's the rule?\n\nAfter step 9: machine off with [1,3] on the machine.\n\n10. put object 0 on -> machine on\n    - Now on machine: [1,3,0]\n    - Machine turns on.\n\nSo with objects 0,1,3, the machine turns on.

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nFirst, note that the machine turns on when a blicket is on it, but the rule might be more complex (e.g., requiring a specific combination).\n\nLet's summarize the key interactions step by step:\n\nInitial state: \n- Machine has object 1 on it (from the initial description: object 1 is on top of the machine). The light is off.\n\nAction 1: put object 5 on the machine -> light remains off.\nAction 2: put object 6 on the machine -> light remains off.\nAction 3: put object 2 on the machine -> light turns ON.\n\nSo, after putting 2 (with 1,5,6 already on), the machine turns on. This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket, but note that object 1 was already on the machine and the light was off until 2 was added.\n\nAfter putting 2: objects on machine: 1,5,6,2 -> light on.\n\nThen:\n- take object 6 off -> light remains on.\n- take object 1 off -> light remains on.\n- take object 5 off -> light remains on.\n\nSo now objects on machine: only object 2 -> light is on? Wait, after taking 5 off, the machine state is only object 2? But the light is on. So object 2 alone can turn the machine on? But note that initially, object 1 was on the machine and the light was off. So object 1 might not be a blicket.\n\nBut then:\n\n- put object 1 on the machine -> light remains on (so adding 1 to [2] doesn't change, still on).\n- put object 3 on the machine -> light remains on (so adding 3 to [2,1] doesn't turn it off, so 3 might not be a problem).\n\nThen:\n- take object 2 off the machine -> light turns OFF.\n\nSo when we remove object 2, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 2 is critical.\n\nNow, after taking 2 off, the objects on the machine are 1 and 3? And the light is off.\n\nThen:\n- put object 0 on the machine -> light turns ON.\n\nSo adding 0 to [1,3] turns the machine on.\n\nThen:\n- put object 6 on the machine -> light remains on.\n- take object 1 off -> light remains on (so now objects: 0,3,6).\n- take object 6 off -> light remains on (objects: 0,3).\n- take object 3 off -> light remains on? Wait, the history says: \"You took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" But then we have only object 0? So object 0 alone is on the machine and the light is on? \n\nWait, let's check the sequence:\n\nAfter taking 3 off: objects should be only 0? And the light is on. So object 0 alone can keep the machine on? Then:\n\n- put object 5 on the machine -> light remains on (objects: 0,5).\n- put object 2 on the machine -> light remains on (objects: 0,5,2).\n- put object 1 on the machine -> light remains on (objects: 0,5,2,1).\n- put object 6 on the machine -> light remains on (objects: 0,5,2,1,6).\n- take object 6 off -> light remains on (objects: 0,5,2,1).\n- put object 4 on the machine -> light remains on (objects: 0,5,2,1,4).\n- put object 6 on the machine -> light remains on (objects: 0,5,2,1,4,6).\n- take object 0 off -> light remains on (objects: 5,2,1,4,6).\n- take object 2 off -> light turns OFF.\n\nSo after removing 2, the machine turns off. Then:\n\n- put object 7 on the machine -> light remains off.\n\nSo now the objects on the machine are 5,1,4,6,7? And the light is off.\n\nFrom the above, we can deduce:\n\n- The machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it? But note that when we had only object 2, the light was on. When we had only object 0, the light was on. But when we had only object 1 initially, the light was off. So 1 is not a blicket.\n\nBut then what about the time when we had objects 1 and 3 and the light was off?

Start: Objects on machine: [1] -> light off.\n   > put object 5 on the machine -> Now objects: [1,5] -> light off.\n2. > put object 6 on the machine -> [1,5,6] -> light off.\n3. > put object 2 on the machine -> [1,5,6,2] -> light turns on.\n\n   So, adding object 2 caused the light to turn on. This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket, or that the combination of objects now meets the rule.\n\n4. > take object 6 off the machine -> [1,5,2] -> light remains on.\n   Removing 6 doesn't turn off the light -> so 6 is not necessary for the current state? Or the rule might be about the presence of certain objects.\n\n5. > take object 1 off the machine -> [5,2] -> light remains on.\n   Removing 1 doesn't turn off the light.\n\n6. > take object 5 off the machine -> [2] -> light remains on.\n   Removing 5 doesn't turn off the light -> so with only 2 on the machine, the light is on? Then object 2 alone might be enough? But wait, at step 1 we had only object 1 and light was off. So object 1 alone is not enough? And when we added 2, the light came on.\n\n   However, note that at step 3, when we added 2 to [1,5,6] the light came on. Then we removed 6 and 1 and 5, leaving only 2 and the light is still on. So it seems that object 2 is a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself? But then why was the machine off at the beginning with only 1? Because object 1 is not a blicket? Or the rule requires more?\n\n   Also, at the start, object 1 was on the machine and the light was off. So object 1 alone doesn't turn the machine on.\n\n7. > put object 1 on the machine -> [2,1] -> light remains on.\n   Adding 1 doesn't change the state (it was already on).\n\n8. > put object 3 on the machine -> [2,1,3] -> light remains on.\n\n9. > take object 2 off the machine -> [1,3] -> light turns off.\n   So removing object 2 caused the light to turn off. This suggests that object 2 is critical for the machine being on in this state? But note that after step 9, we have objects 1 and 3 on the machine and the light is off.\n\n10. > put object 0 on the machine -> [1,3,0] -> light turns on.\n    So adding object 0 turned the light on. Therefore, object 0 might be a blicket? Or the combination of 1,3,0 is activating the machine.\n\n11. > put object 6 on the machine -> [1,3,0,6] -> light remains on.\n\n12. > take object 1 off the machine -> [3,0,6] -> light remains on.\n\n13. > take object 6 off the machine -> [3,0] -> light remains on.\n\n14. > take object 3 off the machine -> [0] -> light remains on?

The light on the machine is now on.\" So it stays on.\n\n    So with only object 0, the light is on? Then object 0 alone is a blicket? But then why at step 9 when we had [1,3] the light was off? And adding 0 turned it on? Also, at step 10, adding 0 to [1,3] turned the light on. So object 0 must be a blicket.\n\n    Also, now we have only object 0 and the light is on.

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nRecall: The machine turns on only when certain conditions (involving blickets) are met. We need to infer the rule and which objects are blickets.\n\nLet's break down the interactions step by step, noting the state of the machine (on/off) and the objects on the machine at each step.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: [1] (since object1 was initially on the machine)\n- Objects on floor: [0,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n- Machine is off.\n\nAction 1: > put object 5 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,5]\n- Machine remains off.\n\nAction 2: > put object 6 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,5,6]\n- Machine remains off.\n\nAction 3: > put object 2 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,5,6,2]\n- Machine turns on.\n\nThis is the first time the machine turns on. So the rule must be satisfied by the set {1,5,6,2}. But note that we don't know which of these are blickets.\n\nAction 4: take object 6 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,5,2] (removed 6)\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 5: take object 1 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [5,2] (removed 1)\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 6: take object 5 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [2] (removed 5)\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAt this point, only object2 is on the machine and the machine is on. This suggests that object2 by itself might be a blicket? But note: the rule might not be that a single blicket turns it on, because initially when only object1 was on, the machine was off.\n\nWait, initially object1 was on the machine and the machine was off. Now with only object2 on, the machine is on. So object1 is not a blicket (or at least not sufficient by itself) and object2 is a blicket (and sufficient by itself?).\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nAction 7: put object 1 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [2,1]\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 8: put object 3 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [2,1,3]\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 9: take object 2 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,3]\n- Machine turns off.\n\nThis is crucial: when we remove object2 (which was the only object that was on when the machine was on before), the machine turns off. So object2 seems essential.\n\nBut note: when we had [5,2] and then [2] the machine was on. Now with [1,3] the machine is off. So object1 and object3 together are not enough.\n\nAction 10: put object 0 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,3,0]\n- Machine turns on.\n\nSo adding object0 to [1,3] turned the machine on. This suggests that object0 is a blicket? But we don't know the rule.\n\nAction 11: put object 6 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,3,0,6]\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 12: take object 1 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [3,0,6] (removed 1)\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 13: take object 6 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [3,0] (removed 6)\n- Machine remains on.\n\nSo now we have [3,0] and the machine is on.\n\nAction 14: take object 3 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [0] (removed 3)\n- Machine remains on.\n\nNow only object0 is on the machine and the machine is on.

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nLet me summarize the interactions step by step, noting the state of the machine (on/off) and which objects are on the machine.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: [1] (since object 1 is on top initially)\n- Objects on floor: [0,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n- Machine light: off\n\nNow, the actions:\n\n1. > put object 5 on the machine\n   - After: Machine has [1,5] \u2192 light off\n\n2. > put object 6 on the machine\n   - After: Machine has [1,5,6] \u2192 light off\n\n3. > put object 2 on the machine\n   - After: Machine has [1,5,6,2] \u2192 light turns ON.\n\n   So, adding object 2 caused the light to turn on. This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket?

This suggests that object 2 is a blicket and that having at least one blicket is sufficient? But wait, initially when object 1 was alone, the light was off. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\n   However, note that initially the machine was off with only object 1. Now with only object 2, it's on. So object 1 might not be a blicket, but object 2 is.\n\n7. > put object 1 on the machine\n   - After: Machine has [2,1] \u2192 light remains ON.\n\n8. > put object 3 on the machine\n   - After: Machine has [2,1,3] \u2192 light remains ON.\n\n9. > take object 2 off the machine\n   - After: Machine has [1,3] \u2192 light turns OFF.\n\n   So removing object 2 turned the light off. This suggests that object 2 is critical. Without it, the light goes off even though objects 1 and 3 are present.\n\n10. > put object 0 on the machine\n    - After: Machine has [1,3,0] \u2192 light turns ON.\n\n    Now, with objects 1, 3, and 0, the light turns on. So object 0 might be a blicket? Or perhaps the combination of 1,3,0 is triggering.\n\n11. > put object 6 on the machine\n    - After: Machine has [1,3,0,6] \u2192 light remains ON.\n\n12. > take object 1 off the machine\n    - After: Machine has [3,0,6] \u2192 light remains ON.\n\n13. > take object 6 off the machine\n    - After: Machine has [3,0] \u2192 light remains ON.\n\n14. > take object 3 off the machine\n    - After: Machine has [0] \u2192 light remains ON.\n\n    So with only object 0, the light is still on? This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n    But wait: in step 9, when we had [1,3] the light was off. Then we added 0 and it turned on. Then we removed 1 and 6 and 3, leaving 0, and the light is still on. So object 0 alone can turn the machine on?

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what the rule for the machine turning on is.\n\nRecall: The machine turns on based on the presence of blickets, but the rule might be complex (e.g., requiring at least one blicket, or a specific combination).\n\nLet's break down the interactions step by step to infer the state of the machine and the blicket status of objects.\n\nInitial state:\n- Machine: light off.\n- Objects on machine: object 1 (already on the machine at start).\n- Objects on floor: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nFirst sequence:\n\n1. Put object 5 on machine -> light off. (So with objects 1 and 5, machine off)\n2. Put object 6 on machine -> light off. (Now objects 1,5,6 on machine -> off)\n3. Put object 2 on machine -> light turns on. (Now objects 1,5,6,2 on machine -> on)\n\nThis suggests that object 2 might be a blicket, because adding it turned the machine on.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe the machine requires at least two blickets? Or a specific one?\n\nNext:\n4. Take object 6 off -> light remains on. (Objects now: 1,5,2 -> on)\n5. Take object 1 off -> light remains on. (Objects: 5,2 -> on)\n6. Take object 5 off -> light remains on. (Objects: only 2 -> on)\n\nSo when only object 2 is on the machine, the light is on. This suggests that object 2 alone is sufficient to turn the machine on? But wait, initially when only object 1 was on, the machine was off (from initial state). So object 1 is not a blicket? And object 5 and 6 don't seem to be either.\n\nBut then:\n\n7. Put object 1 on machine -> light on (with 2 and 1). This doesn't change because 2 is already making it on.\n8. Put object 3 on machine -> light remains on (now 2,1,3). So adding 3 doesn't turn it off? That's expected if it's already on.\n\nBut then:\n\n9. Take object 2 off -> light turns off. (Now objects 1 and 3 on machine -> off)\n\nSo when we remove object 2, the machine turns off. This indicates that object 2 is critical for the machine being on at that point.\n\nThen:\n10. Put object 0 on machine -> light turns on. (Now objects 1,3,0 -> on)\n\nSo adding object 0 turned the machine on? Then object 0 must be a blicket? But we just saw that without 2, the machine was off. Now with 0, it turns on.\n\nSo object 0 might be a blicket.\n\nThen:\n11. Put object 6 on machine -> light remains on. (Now 1,3,0,6 -> on)\n12. Take object 1 off -> light remains on. (Now 3,0,6 -> on)\n13. Take object 6 off -> light remains on. (Now 3,0 -> on)\n14. Take object 3 off -> light remains on. (Now only 0 -> on)\n\nSo when only object 0 is on the machine, the light is on. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket.\n\nNow:\n15. Put object 5 on machine -> light remains on. (Now 0 and 5 -> on)\n16. Put object 2 on machine -> light remains on. (Now 0,5,2 -> on)\n17. Put object 1 on machine -> light remains on. (Now 0,5,2,1 -> on)\n18. Put object 6 on machine -> light remains on. (Now 0,5,2,1,6 -> on)\n19. Take object 6 off -> light remains on. (Now 0,5,2,1 -> on)\n20. Put object 4 on machine -> light remains on. (Now 0,5,2,1,4 -> on)\n21. Put object 6 on machine -> light remains on. (Now 0,5,2,1,4,6 -> on)\n22. Take object 0 off -> light remains on. (Now 5,2,1,4,6 -> on)\n\nSo after removing object 0, the machine is still on.
