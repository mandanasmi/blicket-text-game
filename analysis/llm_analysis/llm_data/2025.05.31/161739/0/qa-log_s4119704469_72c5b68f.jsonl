Also, when only object 4 was on the machine (after step 6) the machine was on? But step 6: after removing object 2, we had only object 4 and machine was on?

No, step 5: we took object 0 off, then step 6: take object 2 off. So after step 6, only object 4 is on the machine and the machine is on? But step 6 says: \"You took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So machine remains on.\n\nThen step 7: put object 1 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n\nThen step 8: take object 4 off -> machine turns off.\n\nSo when we remove object 4 (leaving object 1) the machine turns off. This suggests that object 4 is a blicket and object 1 is not? Or at least that the machine requires object 4 to be on? But note that in step 4, when we put object 4 on (along with 0 and 2) the machine turned on. Then removing 0 and 2 (steps 5 and 6) left only object 4 and the machine stayed on. Then when we added object 1 (step 7) the machine stayed on, but then removing object 4 turned it off. So object 4 is necessary to keep the machine on?

But then removing 0 and 2 left only 4 and the machine stayed on. Then when 4 was removed, the machine turned off. This suggests that object 4 is a blicket and that having at least one blicket might be the rule? But wait, when we had only object 1 on the machine (after step 7) the machine was on. Then we removed 4 and it turned off? Actually step 8: after removing 4 (leaving only 1) the machine turned off. So that suggests that object 1 is not a blicket? But then step 9: adding object 5 to {1} turned the machine on. Then when we removed 1 (leaving only 5) the machine stayed on (step 10). Then removing 5 turned it off (step 12). So object 5 is a blicket.\n\nSo far, we have:\n- Object 4: critical in the first part. Without it, the machine turned off. Also, when it was added to two non-blickets (0 and 2) the machine turned on. So it's a blicket.\n- Object 5: when added to object 1 (which we suspect is not a blicket) the machine turned on. And when left alone, the machine stayed on until removed. So it's a blicket.\n\nBut what about object 1? In step 7, we put object 1 on the machine when only object 4 was on (and the machine was on). Then when we removed object 4 (step 8) the machine turned off. That means that with only object 1, the machine turned off. So object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nSimilarly, object 0 and 2: when they were on the machine together without object 4, the machine was off (steps 2 and 3). So they are not blickets.\n\nNow, step 9: putting object 5 on the machine when only object 1 was on (and the machine was off) turned it on. So object 5 is a blicket.\n\nStep 10: removing object 1 (leaving only 5) kept the machine on. Then step 11: adding object 6 didn't change the state (on). Then step 12: removing object 5 turned the machine off. So object 6 didn't keep the machine on. Therefore, object 6 is not a blicket.\n\nFinally, steps 13 and 14: with object 6 and 3, and then adding 7, the machine remained off. So objects 3 and 7 are not blickets.\n\nBut wait, what about the rule? It seems that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on the machine.

Actually, when we put object 4 on, the machine turned on. And now when we remove others, it stays on? Let's see the next step:\n\n7. Put object 1 on the machine -> Machine remains ON (still on).\n   Now: objects 4 and 1 are on the machine? But we had only object 4 and then added 1. The machine was already on and remains on.\n\n8. Take object 4 off -> Machine turns OFF.\n   Now: only object 1 is on the machine -> machine turns off.\n\nSo when object 4 was removed, the machine turned off even though object 1 was still on. This suggests that object 4 is critical and that object 1 is not sufficient to keep the machine on.\n\n9. Put object 5 on the machine -> Machine turns ON.\n   Now: objects 1 and 5 are on the machine? But we just had object 1 and the machine was off. Then we added object 5 and it turned on.\n\nSo object 5 seems to have turned the machine on? But note: we had object 1 already on the machine and then added object 5 and it turned on. So either object 5 alone is a blicket, or the combination of 1 and 5.\n\n10. Take object 1 off -> Machine remains ON.\n    Now: only object 5 is on the machine -> still on.\n\nThis suggests that object 5 alone can keep the machine on? So object 5 is a blicket? But let's see:\n\n11. Put object 6 on the machine -> Machine remains ON.\n    Now: objects 5 and 6 are on the machine? The machine was already on and remains on.\n\n12. Take object 5 off -> Machine turns OFF.\n    Now: only object 6 is on the machine -> machine turns off.\n\nSo when object 5 is removed, the machine turns off even though object 6 is still on. This suggests that object 5 was the one keeping it on and object 6 is not a blicket? Or at least not sufficient.\n\n13. Put object 3 on the machine -> Machine remains OFF.\n    Now: objects 6 and 3 are on the machine? The machine was off and remains off.\n\n14. Put object 7 on the machine -> Machine remains OFF.\n    Now: objects 6, 3, and 7 are on the machine -> still off.\n\nSo what do we know?\n\n- When object 4 was on the machine alone, the machine was on (after step 6). So object 4 is a blicket.\n- When object 5 was on the machine alone, the machine was on (after step 10). So object 5 is a blicket.\n\nBut what about the others?\n\nLet's look at when the machine turned on:\n\n- First time: when we added object 4 to objects 2 and 0 -> turned on. Then when we removed 0 and 2, it stayed on (only 4). So 4 is a blicket.\n\n- Second time: when we added object 5 to object 1 -> turned on. Then when we removed object 1, it stayed on (only 5).

Machine is off.\n2. > put object 2 on the machine -> Machine remains off.\n3. > put object 0 on the machine -> Machine remains off.\n4. > put object 4 on the machine -> Machine turns on.\n\nAt this point, we have objects 2, 0, and 4 on the machine. The machine turned on when object 4 was added. This suggests that object 4 might be a blicket and that the machine requires at least one blicket to turn on? But note that objects 2 and 0 were already on and didn't cause the machine to turn on. So it's possible that object 4 is a blicket and the machine requires the presence of at least one blicket.\n\nBut let's continue:\n\n5. > take object 0 off the machine -> Machine remains on.\n   - Now objects on machine: 2 and 4.\n6. > take object 2 off the machine -> Machine remains on.\n   - Now only object 4 is on the machine. So the machine is on with only object 4. This suggests that object 4 alone can turn on the machine? But note that when we added object 4 (step 4) it turned on when there were already two non-blickets (0 and 2) on the machine.

So when we remove object 4 (the blicket), the machine turns off.\n\nThis is consistent: object 4 is a blicket and it can turn the machine on by itself. Also, when it is removed, the machine turns off if no other blicket is present.\n\nNow, let's look at the rest:\n\n9. > put object 5 on the machine -> Machine turns on.\n   - Now object 1 is on the machine (non-blicket, we think) and we add object 5 -> machine turns on.

But we don't know if object 1 is a blicket or not. However, in step 8, when we removed object 4 (leaving only object 1) the machine turned off, meaning object 1 is not a blicket. So when we add object 5 to object 1, the machine turns on -> object 5 is a blicket.\n\n10. > take object 1 off the machine -> Machine remains on.\n    - Now only object 5 is on the machine.

We need to infer which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on.\n\nLet's break down the interactions step by step:\n\n1. Initially: All objects on the floor. Machine off.\n\n2. > put object 2 on the machine\n   - Machine remains off.\n\n3. > put object 0 on the machine\n   - Machine remains off.\n\n4. > put object 4 on the machine\n   - Machine turns on.\n\nAt this point, we have objects 2, 0, and 4 on the machine. The machine turned on when 4 was added. This suggests that object 4 might be a blicket, but we don't know the rule yet. It could be that having at least one blicket turns it on, but note that when only 2 and 0 were on, it was off. So 2 and 0 are not blickets? Or the rule might require more than one.\n\n5. > take object 0 off the machine\n   - Machine remains on.\n\nNow objects on machine: 2 and 4. Machine on.\n\n6. > take object 2 off the machine\n   - Machine remains on.\n\nNow only object 4 is on the machine, and the machine is on. This suggests that object 4 alone can turn the machine on. So object 4 is a blicket, and the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\n7. > put object 1 on the machine\n   - Machine remains on.\n\nNow objects: 4 and 1. Machine on.\n\n8. > take object 4 off the machine\n   - Machine turns off.\n\nNow only object 1 is on the machine, and the machine turns off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket because when the blicket (object 4) was removed, the machine turned off even though object 1 was still there.\n\n9. > put object 5 on the machine\n   - Machine turns on.\n\nNow objects: 1 and 5. Machine turns on. Since we just had object 1 alone and it was off, but adding 5 turns it on, so object 5 must be a blicket.\n\n10. > take object 1 off the machine\n    - Machine remains on.\n\nNow only object 5 is on the machine, and the machine is on. This confirms that object 5 is a blicket.\n\n11. > put object 6 on the machine\n    - Machine remains on.\n\nNow objects: 5 and 6. Machine on.\n\n12. > take object 5 off the machine\n    - Machine turns off.\n\nNow only object 6 is on the machine, and the machine turns off. So object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n13. > put object 3 on the machine\n    - Machine remains off.\n\nNow objects: 6 and 3. Machine off. We know object 6 is not a blicket, and adding 3 doesn't turn it on, so object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n14. > put object 7 on the machine\n    - Machine remains off.\n\nNow objects: 6, 3, and 7. Machine off. We don't have any blicket on the machine.\n\nSo from the interactions, we have identified:\n\n- Object 4: blicket (because when it was alone, machine on; and when removed with non-blickets, machine off)\n- Object 5: blicket (when it was added to object 1 (non-blicket), machine turned on; and when alone, machine on)\n- Object 0: not a blicket (when on with 2 and 4, but machine turned on only after 4 was added; and when removed, machine stayed on because 4 was still there)\n- Object 2: not a blicket (similar to 0)\n- Object 1: not a blicket (when alone with 4, machine turned off when 4 was removed; and when alone, machine off; and when 5 was added, machine on)\n- Object 6: not a blicket (when alone after 5 was removed, machine off)\n- Object 3: not a blicket (added with 6 and 7 and machine didn't turn on)\n\nNow, what about object 7? In the last step, when object 7 was added to the machine (which already had 6 and 3), the machine remained off. Since we know that 6 and 3 are not blickets, if object 7 were a blicket, then the machine should have turned on (because the rule seems to be that having at least one blicket turns the machine on).
