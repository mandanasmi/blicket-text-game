We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule the machine follows for turning on.\n\nRecall: The machine turns on only when at least one blicket is on it?

Let's analyze step by step.\n\nInitial state: All objects on the floor, machine off.\n\nAction 1: Put object 5 on machine -> machine remains off.\n  So, object 5 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\nAction 2: Put object 1 on machine (now objects 5 and 1 are on the machine) -> machine turns on.\n  This suggests that the presence of object 1 (along with 5) caused the machine to turn on.\n\nBut note: when we remove object 5 (Action 3: take object 5 off), the machine remains on. So even without object 5, the machine is on (so object 1 must be a blicket?).\n\nThen in Action 4: put object 0 on the machine (now objects 1 and 0 are on) -> machine remains on.\n\nThen in Action 5: take object 1 off (now only object 0 is on) -> machine turns off.\n  This suggests that when we remove object 1, the machine turns off even though object 0 is still on. Therefore, object 0 alone does not keep the machine on? But note that when we added object 0 with object 1 present, the machine stayed on. Then when we removed object 1, the machine turned off. This implies that object 1 is a blicket and object 0 might not be.\n\nNow, let's look at the rest:\n\nAction 6: put object 4 on the machine (alone) -> machine off.\nAction 7: put object 6 on (with 4? So now 4 and 6) -> still off.\nAction 8: put object 2 on (with 4 and 6) -> machine turns on.\n\nSo, when we added object 2 to objects 4 and 6, the machine turned on. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket? But then we remove object 2 (Action 9) and the machine turns off (even though 4 and 6 are still on). So that confirms that object 2 is a blicket and the others (4 and 6) are not.\n\nThen we put object 7 (alone? or with 4 and 6? The state now: after removing object 2, the machine is off and the objects on the machine are 4 and 6? Then we add 7 -> still off. Then add 3 -> still off.\n\nSo let's summarize what we know:\n\n- When object 1 was added to object 5, the machine turned on. Then removing 5 left 1 and the machine stayed on. Then adding 0 (so 1 and 0) and the machine stayed on. Then removing 1 (leaving 0) turned the machine off. This implies:\n  - Object 1 is a blicket (because when it was present the machine was on, and when removed the machine turned off even though 0 was there).\n  - Object 0 is not a blicket? Because when it was alone the machine turned off? But note that when we added object 0 to object 1, the machine stayed on. That doesn't contradict because the rule might require at least one blicket. So object 0 alone doesn't turn it on.\n\nSimilarly, for the second part:\n  - Objects 4 and 6 together don't turn on the machine (they were on and machine off). Then adding object 2 (a blicket) turned it on. Then removing object 2 (leaving 4 and 6) turned it off.\n\nSo what is the rule? It seems the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on it.\n\nNow, what about object 5? We saw that when object 5 was alone, the machine didn't turn on. And when we added object 1 (a blicket) to object 5, the machine turned on. But then when we removed object 5, the machine stayed on (because object 1 was still there). So object 5 is not a blicket.\n\nObject 4 and 6: we saw they don't turn on the machine when together without a blicket. Also, when they were on with object 2 (a blicket) and we removed object 2, the machine turned off. So they are not blickets.\n\nObject 7 and 3: we added them to the machine (which already had 4 and 6) and the machine remained off.

This suggests that object 1 alone is sufficient to keep the machine on? But note that the machine was turned on by the pair (5 and 1). Now when we remove 5, it stays on. This implies that the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present? But wait, then why didn't object 5 alone turn it on? So object 5 might not be a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the rule. The machine might require a specific set to be present. However, note that after removing object 5, the machine remains on with only object 1. So object 1 alone is enough to keep the machine on? But then why didn't it turn on when only object 5 was present? Because object 5 is not a blicket.\n\nSo at this point, we can hypothesize:\n  - Object 1 is a blicket (because when it was added, the machine turned on, and then even after removing 5, it stayed on).\n  - Object 5 is not a blicket (because when it was alone, the machine did not turn on).\n\nBut note: when we added object 1 to object 5, the machine turned on.

We remove object 1 and the machine turns off. This suggests that without object 1, the machine turns off even though object 0 is still there. Therefore, object 0 alone is not enough to keep the machine on? And note that we had object 0 and 1 together and the machine was on. So when we remove object 1, the machine turns off. This implies that object 1 is the only blicket on the machine at that time? Because object 0 was added and the machine stayed on (because object 1 was still there). Then when object 1 is removed, the machine turns off.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the rule is: The machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on it. And it remains on as long as at least one blicket is on it.\n\nBut let's check the rest:\n\nAfter taking off object 1, the machine is off. Then:\n\nAction 6: Put object 4 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n  - So object 4 alone does not turn the machine on (so not a blicket).\n\nAction 7: Put object 6 on the machine (now objects 0, 4, and 6) -> machine remains off.\n  - Still off, so none of these are blickets.\n\nAction 8: Put object 2 on the machine (now objects 0,4,6,2) -> machine turns on.\n  - This means that adding object 2 turned the machine on.

But note that the machine was off until object 2 was added. So object 2 might be a blicket? However, we must consider the rule.\n\nBut let's also note what happens when we remove object 2:\n10. > take object 2 off the machine -> machine turns off (objects 0,4,6 remain and machine off).\n\nThis suggests that object 2 is necessary to turn the machine on in that configuration.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the rule for the machine turning on.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n\n- When object 1 was put on the machine (with object 5 already on) the machine turned on. Then when object 5 was removed, the machine stayed on. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket and that having at least one blicket on the machine turns it on? But then when we put object 0 on (with object 1) the machine stayed on, but when we removed object 1 (leaving object 0) the machine turned off. This implies that object 0 is not a blicket and that object 1 is a blicket.\n\nBut then in the next steps, we have:\n- Objects 0, 4, and 6 are on the machine and the machine is off. Then when we add object 2, the machine turns on. Then when we remove object 2, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket because adding it turned the machine on and removing it turned the machine off.\n\nBut wait, what about the other objects? We have:\n\n- Object 5: when put alone (with nothing else) the machine didn't turn on. Then when object 1 was added, the machine turned on. Then when object 5 was removed, the machine stayed on. This suggests object 5 is not a blicket because the machine didn't turn on with only object 5, and removing it didn't turn the machine off (because the blicket object 1 was still there).\n\n- Object 1: when added to object 5 (non-blicket) the machine turned on. When removed (leaving object 0, which we now suspect is non-blicket) the machine turned off. So object 1 is a blicket.\n\n- Object 0: when put on the machine with object 1 (blicket) the machine stayed on. But when object 1 was removed, leaving only object 0, the machine turned off. Also, when we later had objects 0,4,6 (all non-blickets?) the machine was off. So object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n- Object 4 and 6: we put them on the machine (with object 0) and the machine remained off. Then when we added object 2, the machine turned on. Then we removed object 2 and the machine turned off. So without object 2, the machine is off even though objects 0,4,6 are present.

Put object 5 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n   - So, object 5 alone does not turn on the machine.\n\n2. Put object 1 on the machine (now objects 5 and 1 are on) -> machine turns on.\n   - This suggests that either:\n     - Object 1 is a blicket and together with 5 (which may or may not be a blicket) they turn it on, OR\n     - Object 1 alone is sufficient?

Take object 5 off -> machine remains on.\n   - Now only object 1 is on the machine and the machine is on. This implies that object 1 is a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself (or at least without object 5). Also, note that when we removed 5, the machine stayed on, so 5 is not necessary for keeping it on. Thus, object 1 alone is sufficient.\n\n4. Put object 0 on the machine (now objects 1 and 0 are on) -> machine remains on.\n   - This doesn't change the state because the machine was already on.\n\n5. Take object 1 off -> machine turns off.\n   - Now we have only object 0 on the machine. The machine turns off. This implies that object 0 alone is not sufficient to keep the machine on. Also, note that when we removed object 1 (which we know is a blicket) the machine turned off, so object 0 is not a blicket? Or maybe the rule requires more than one?

Put object 6 on the machine (now 0,4,6) -> machine remains off.\n\n8. Put object 2 on the machine (now 0,4,6,2) -> machine turns on.\n   - This is interesting. The machine turns on when object 2 is added. So object 2 must be a blicket? But note that there are other objects on the machine (0,4,6). However, step 5 showed that object 0 alone (or with 4 and 6) did not turn it on. So the turning on must be due to object 2.\n\n   Therefore, object 2 is a blicket.\n\n   Also, note that the machine turned on when we added object 2 to the existing set (0,4,6). Since 0,4,6 together didn't turn it on, but adding 2 did, object 2 is a blicket.\n\n9. Take object 2 off -> machine turns off.\n   - This confirms that without object 2 (and with 0,4,6) the machine turns off. So object 2 is necessary for that state to be on? But note that when we remove 2, we are left with 0,4,6 which we know from step 7 did not turn the machine on. So consistent.\n\n   Also, note that the machine turned off when we removed object 2, which is a blicket.\n\n10. Put object 7 on the machine (now 0,4,6,7) -> machine remains off.\n\n11.

Initially, all objects are on the floor.

This confirms that object 1 is a blicket (because the machine stays on even after removing 5).\n\n 5. > put object 0 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n    Since the machine was already on, we cannot tell if object 0 is a blicket by this action alone.\n\n 6. > take object 1 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n    This is critical: when we remove object 1 (the blicket that was keeping the machine on) and leave object 0, the machine turns off. \n    This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket. Because if object 0 were a blicket, the machine would have stayed on.\n\n 7. > put object 4 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n    This suggests that object 4 is not a blicket (or not sufficient by itself).\n 8. > put object 6 on the machine -> machine remains off (now 4 and 6 are on, but still off). So neither 4 nor 6 is a blicket? Or the rule requires more?\n 9. > put object 2 on the machine -> machine turns on.\n    Since adding object 2 turned the machine on (with 4 and 6 already present), it means that object 2 is a blicket. \n    Also, note that the machine turned on immediately when object 2 was added. So object 2 is a blicket.\n\n 10. > take object 2 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n     This confirms that object 2 was the only blicket on the machine at that time (since removing it turned the machine off). \n     Therefore, objects 4 and 6 are not blickets.\n\n 11. > put object 7 on the machine -> machine remains off (currently only object 7 is on the machine? Actually, we had objects 4 and 6 still on the machine? Let's check the state:\n\n     After step 10: \n        We took object 2 off, so now we have objects 4 and 6 on the machine and the machine is off. \n        Then we put object 7 on the machine -> so now objects 4,6,7 are on the machine and the machine is off.\n\n 12. > put object 3 on the machine -> machine remains off (now objects 4,6,7,3 are on the machine and still off).\n\n From the above:\n\n We know:\n   - Object 1 is a blicket (from step 3 and 6: when only object 1 was on, machine was on; and when removed, machine turned off).\n   - Object 2 is a blicket (from step 9: when added to non-blickets, turned on; and step 10: when removed, turned off).\n   - Object 0 is not a blicket (step 5 and 6: when object 1 was removed and only object 0 was left, machine turned off).\n   - Object 5 is not a blicket (step 2: put alone, didn't turn on; step 3: adding object 1 turned it on, but then removing 5 didn't turn it off so it wasn't contributing).\n   - Objects 4 and 6 are not blickets: they were on the machine together (step 8) and the machine was off, then adding object 2 (blicket) turned it on. Also, when object 2 was removed (step 10), the machine turned off even though 4 and 6 were still on.\n\n Now, what about object 7?\n   - In step 11, we put object 7 on the machine (along with objects 4 and 6).
