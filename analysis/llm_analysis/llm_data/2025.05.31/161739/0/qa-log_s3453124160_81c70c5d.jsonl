So the machine was on with objects {4,7,2,1} (since we removed 0,6,3) and then removing 3 caused it to turn off.\n\n Step 13: put object 0 on -> machine off (so adding object 0 didn't turn it back on)\n Step 14: take object 2 off -> machine off (still off, so we have objects 4,7,1,0 on the machine? but note we just put 0 and then removed 2, so the set is {4,7,1,0} and machine off)\n\n Step 15: put object 3 on -> machine turns ON.\n\n So adding object 3 to {4,7,1,0} turned the machine on.\n\n Step 16: take object 7 off -> machine remains on\n Step 17: take object 4 off -> machine remains on\n\n Now we have objects 1,0,3 on the machine and the machine is on.\n\n Let's try to deduce the rule:\n\n From step 9: adding object 1 to {4,3,7,6,0,2} turned the machine on. So the set became {4,3,7,6,0,2,1}. Then we removed 0,6,3 and the machine turned off when removing 3.\n\n From step 15: adding object 3 to {4,7,1,0} turned the machine on. The set became {4,7,1,0,3}. Then we removed 7 and 4 and the machine remained on with {1,0,3}.\n\n So the machine can be on with just {1,0,3}? But note that when we had {4,7,1,0} the machine was off, and then adding 3 turned it on.\n\n Also note that when we had {4,3,7,6,0,2} (without object 1) the machine was off. Then adding object 1 turned it on.\n\n However, after step 9, we have:\n   On machine: 4,3,7,6,0,2,1 -> machine on.\n   Removing 0: machine remains on -> so without 0, the set {4,3,7,6,2,1} is still on.\n   Removing 6: machine remains on -> set {4,3,7,2,1} is on.\n   Removing 3: machine turns off -> so set {4,7,2,1} is off.\n\n So the machine requires at least one of the blickets that was removed? Specifically, when we removed 3, it turned off. So object 3 might be critical.\n\n Now, in step 15, we had {4,7,1,0} (which is off) and then added 3 -> turned on. So again, 3 seems critical.\n\n Also, note that when we added object 1 to the set without it, the machine turned on.

But note that object 5 was taken off and then 1 was added, so the set is without 5 and with 1.\n\n- After removing 0 and 6, the machine remains on with {1,2,3,4,7}. Then removing 3 turns the machine off. This suggests that object 3 is critical.\n\n- Later, when we have {0,1,4,7} (after step 14) and we put 3 back on, the machine turns on. So the set {0,1,3,4,7} turns the machine on.\n\n- Then removing 7 and 4 leaves {0,1,3} and the machine remains on.\n\nTherefore, we can see that the machine is on when at least object 1 and object 3 are present? Let's check:\n\n- In the set {0,1,3,4,7} the machine is on. Then after removing 7 and 4, we have {0,1,3} and the machine is still on. So the presence of 0,1,3 is sufficient? But note that at step 9, when we had {0,1,2,3,4,6,7} the machine turned on, and then we removed 0 and 6 and it stayed on with {1,2,3,4,7}. Then removing 3 turned it off. So 3 is necessary.\n\nBut what about object 1? In the configuration at step 9, we added 1 and the machine turned on. Before that, we had {0,2,3,4,6,7} (without 1) and the machine was off. So adding 1 turned it on. Therefore, 1 is also necessary.\n\nMoreover, when we have {0,1,3} at the end, the machine is on. So that set is sufficient.\n\nBut is object 0 a blicket?

Take 4 off -> machine remains on.\n    Now on machine: 1,0,3 -> machine on.\n\nWe are asked: Is object 3 a blicket?\n\nWe need to infer the rule for the machine turning on. The machine turns on when a set of blickets are on the machine. We must figure out which objects are blickets and what the rule is.\n\nLet's analyze when the machine turns on and off:\n\nFirst time the machine turns on: Step 9. When we put object 1 on the machine (with 4,3,7,6,0,2 already on, and after removing 5). So the set was {4,3,7,6,0,2,1}. Then it turned on.\n\nBut note that when we remove objects later, the machine sometimes turns off.\n\nKey observations:\n\n- After step 9: {4,3,7,6,0,2,1} -> machine on.\n- Step 10: remove 0 -> {4,3,7,6,2,1} -> machine stays on.\n- Step 11: remove 6 -> {4,3,7,2,1} -> machine stays on.\n- Step 12: remove 3 -> {4,7,2,1} -> machine turns off.\n\nThis suggests that object 3 is critical for the machine being on in that configuration? But then in step 15, when we put 3 back (on a different set), the machine turns on again.\n\nStep 15: We have on the machine: {4,7,1,0} (after step 14) and then we add 3 -> {4,7,1,0,3} and the machine turns on.\n\nThen step 16: remove 7 -> {4,1,0,3} -> machine remains on.\nStep 17: remove 4 -> {1,0,3} -> machine remains on.\n\nSo the machine can be on with {1,0,3}? But earlier when we had {4,7,1,0} without 3, it was off (step 14). Then adding 3 turned it on.\n\nWhat is the minimal set that turns the machine on?\n\nWe see that the machine turned on when we added object 1 to the set {4,3,7,6,0,2} (which was without 5 and with 1). But note that set without 1 was off.\n\nAlso, note that when we had {4,3,7,6,0,2,1} and we removed 3, the machine turned off (step 12). Then when we put 3 back (step 15) on a different set {4,7,1,0}, it turned on.\n\nThis suggests that the machine might require a specific combination of blickets.

Take 4 off machine -> machine remains on.\n    Now objects: 1,0,3 -> machine on.\n\n    This is important: when we took off object 4, the machine stayed on. This suggests that object 4 is not necessary for the machine to stay on at that point.\n\n Now, we are asked: is object 4 a blicket?\n\n We need to define what a blicket is. Typically, a blicket should be an object that has the property that when it is on the machine (and possibly in combination with others) the machine turns on. But note the rule might be complex.\n\n Let's try to infer the rule:\n\n From the critical events:\n\n - When we had objects 4,3,7,6,0,2 and then added 1 -> machine turned on. So the set {4,3,7,6,0,2,1} is on and the machine turns on.\n\n - Then we remove 0 and 6, and the machine stays on. Then we remove 3 and the machine turns off. So the set without 3 (which is {4,7,2,1}) does not turn the machine on? But note at step 12 the machine turned off when we removed 3.\n\n - Then we put 3 back and the machine turns on (step 15). So 3 is critical.\n\n - Also, when we had the set {4,7,1,0,3} (after step 15) the machine was on. Then we remove 7 and the machine remains on -> so 7 is not critical? Then we remove 4 and the machine remains on -> so 4 is not critical.\n\n But note: the machine turning on might be triggered by the presence of a specific set. However, the rule might be that the machine is on if at least one blicket is present? But that doesn't fit because:\n\n   - Initially, we had several objects (including 4,3, etc.) and the machine didn't turn on until we added 1.\n\n   - Then we removed 3 and the machine turned off, even though 1 was still there?

At that point, the objects on the machine were: 4,3,7,6,0,2,1. But note that we had just removed object 5 and then added 1. Also, note that before adding 1, the machine was off with objects [4,3,7,6,0,2]. So adding 1 made it turn on.\n\n- Then, when we removed object 3 (step 13), the machine turned off. At that point, the objects were [4,7,2,1] (after removing 3). So removing 3 caused it to turn off.\n\n- Later, when we put object 3 back (step 16), the machine turned on again. At that point, the objects were [4,7,1,0,3] (after adding 3). So adding 3 made it turn on.\n\nThis suggests that object 3 and object 1 are important. Also, note that object 1 was added when the machine turned on for the first time, and object 3 was critical because removing it turned the machine off and adding it back turned it on.\n\nMoreover, when we removed object 7 (step 17) and then object 4 (step 18), the machine stayed on. So at the end, we had objects 1,0,3 on the machine and the machine was on.\n\nBut note that in step 14, we had objects [4,7,1,0] and the machine was off. Then we added 3 and it turned on. So the presence of object 3 seems to be necessary for the machine to be on? But wait, let's see the state when the machine was on without 3? Actually, after step 10, we had machine on without object 3? No, in step 10, object 3 was on the machine until step 13. In step 10, we had [4,3,7,6,0,2,1] and machine on.

Machine on.)\n\nNow let's try to infer the rule.\n\nFrom step 9: When we put object 1 on (with 4,3,7,6,0,2 already on, but without 5) the machine turned on. So the set {4,3,7,6,0,2,1} turns the machine on.\n\nBut then when we removed 0 and 6 (step 10 and 11) the machine remained on, so the set {4,3,7,2,1} must also turn the machine on? However, in step 12 when we removed 3, the machine turned off. So the set {4,7,2,1} (without 3) does not turn the machine on? But then in step 13 we added 0 and it still didn't turn on? Actually, step 13: after removing 3 (and having 4,7,2,1) we put 0 on and it was still off. Then we removed 2 (step 14) and it was still off. Then we put 3 on (step 15) and it turned on.\n\nSo the rule must involve object 3 and object 1? Because:\n\n- Without object 1, we had many objects and the machine was off until we added 1 (step 9).\n- Without object 3, the machine turned off (step 12) and then when we added 3 again (step 15) it turned on.\n\nBut note that in step 17, we have only objects 1,0,3 and the machine is on. So the set {1,0,3} is sufficient? But in step 13 we had {4,7,1,0} and it was off. Then when we added 3 it turned on. So 3 is necessary.\n\nAlso, in step 9, when we added 1 to the existing set (which included 3) it turned on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine?

So, with objects 0,2,3,4,6,7 and then adding 1, the machine turns on.\n\nSo, the set on the machine when it turns on: {0,1,2,3,4,6,7} (note: object 5 is off)\n\nStep 10: Take object 0 off -> light remains ON.\n\nStep 11: Take object 6 off -> light remains ON.\n\nStep 12: Take object 3 off -> light turns OFF.\n\nAfter removing object 3, the machine turns off. So, the set on the machine now: {1,2,4,7} (since we removed 0,6, and then 3)\n\nStep 13: Put object 0 on the machine -> light remains OFF.\n\nSet: {0,1,2,4,7} -> off.\n\nStep 14: Take object 2 off the machine -> light remains OFF.\n\nSet: {0,1,4,7} -> off.\n\nStep 15: Put object 3 on the machine -> light turns ON.\n\nSet: {0,1,3,4,7} -> on.\n\nStep 16: Take object 7 off the machine -> light remains ON.\n\nSet: {0,1,3,4} -> on.\n\nStep 17: Take object 4 off the machine -> light remains ON.\n\nSet: {0,1,3} -> on.\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\n- The machine turned on for the first time when we added object 1 to the set {0,2,3,4,6,7}. So without object 1, the set {0,2,3,4,6,7} did not turn the machine on. Therefore, object 1 is critical.\n\n- Then, when we removed object 3 (step 12) from the set that had {1,2,4,7} (and also 0 and 6 were removed earlier) the machine turned off. This suggests that object 3 is also critical because removing it caused the machine to turn off.\n\n- Later, when we put object 3 back (step 15) to the set {0,1,4,7} (which was off), the machine turned on. This again shows that object 3 is important.\n\n- Also, note that when we removed object 7 (step 16) from the set {0,1,3,4,7} (which was on), the machine remained on. Similarly, removing object 4 (step 17) from {0,1,3,4} (which was on) left {0,1,3} and the machine remained on.\n\nSo, what objects are critical?\n\nFrom the above:\n\n- Object 1 and object 3 seem to be necessary because:\n  - Adding object 1 turned the machine on (step 9).\n  - Removing object 3 turned the machine off (step 12), and adding it back turned it on (step 15).\n\nNow, what about other objects?\n\nWhen the machine was on with {0,1,2,3,4,6,7} (step 9) and we removed objects 0 and 6 (steps 10 and 11), the machine remained on. Then we removed 3 and it turned off. So 0 and 6 are not necessary.\n\nAlso, when we had {1,2,4,7} (after removing 0 and 6) and then removed 3 (leaving {1,2,4,7} without 3) the machine turned off.
