The light turns on when object 3 is added. So one of these (or a combination) caused the light to turn on.\n\nBut note: initially object 2 was on the machine and the light was off. Then adding 6 didn't turn it on. Then adding 3 turned it on. So object 3 might be a blicket.\n\nStep 3: take object 2 off -> light remains on.\n\nNow objects on machine: 6 and 3.

This suggests that object 0 is a blicket? But let's see the state: objects now are 6,1,5,7,0. When we added 0, the light turned on. So either object 0 is a blicket or the combination of these objects (with 0) activated the machine.\n\nBut note: we know object 3 was a blicket and now we have object 0 turning the machine on.

Therefore, object 0 must be a blicket? But note that we also have objects 6,1,5,7 on the machine. The machine turned on when we added object 0. So either object 0 is a blicket and its presence, along with possibly others, satisfies the rule? Or maybe the rule requires object 0 and object 3?

So that suggests that without 3, the machine turns off.\n\n But then in step 10: we have [6,1,5,7,0] and the light turns on. Then we remove 5 and the light stays on (step 11).\n\n Also, in step 19: when we remove 3 from [7,1,3] (which became [7,1] after removing 0 and then 3) the light goes off. So again, without 3 the machine turns off? But note that at step 15 we removed 3 from [7,0,3] to leave [7,0] and the light stayed on.

We need to determine if object 6 is a blicket.\n A blicket is an object that has the property (blicktness) that can cause the machine to turn on, but note that the machine may have a rule that involves multiple objects.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note the initial state: \n      Objects on machine: object 2 (only)\n      Machine is off.\n\n 2. We go through each action and the resulting machine state:\n\n    Action: put object 6 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n        Machine state: objects 2 and 6 -> off.\n\n    Action: put object 3 on the machine -> machine turns on.\n        Now on machine: 2, 6, 3 -> on.\n\n    Action: take object 2 off -> machine remains on (so 2 is not necessary for the current on state).\n        Now on machine: 6, 3 -> on.\n\n    Action: take object 6 off -> machine remains on.\n        Now on machine: only 3 -> on. This suggests that object 3 alone can turn the machine on? But note that initially when 2 and 6 were on, the machine was off until 3 was added.\n\n    However, let's reexamine: \n        After putting 3, the machine turned on. Then removing 2 (leaving 6 and 3) -> on. Then removing 6 (leaving only 3) -> on. So object 3 alone seems to be a blicket.\n\n    But then:\n\n    Action: put object 6 back -> machine remains on (now 3 and 6 are on).\n    Action: put object 1 -> machine remains on (now 3,6,1).\n    Action: take object 3 off -> machine turns off (so without 3, the machine turns off even though 6 and 1 are on). This suggests that object 3 is critical.\n\n    Then:\n        put object 5 -> off (so 5 is not turning it on, and note current set: 6,1,5 -> off)\n        put object 7 -> off (6,1,5,7 -> off)\n        put object 0 -> on (so adding 0 made it turn on). Now the set is 6,1,5,7,0 -> on.\n\n    Then:\n        take object 5 off -> on (now 6,1,7,0 -> on)\n        put object 3 on -> on (now 6,1,7,0,3 -> on)\n        take object 6 off -> on (now 1,7,0,3 -> on)\n        take object 1 off -> on (now 7,0,3 -> on)\n        take object 3 off -> on (now 7,0 -> on? But then note: \n            After taking 3 off, the machine is on? But previously when 3 was removed (with 6 and 1) the machine turned off. Now with 7 and 0 it is on? This suggests that 7 and 0 together might be blickets? Or perhaps 0 alone? But note when 0 was added to the set (which had 6,1,5,7) it turned on. So 0 might be a blicket.\n\n    However, then:\n\n        Action: put object 1 on -> on (now 7,0,1 -> on)\n        put object 3 on -> on (now 7,0,1,3 -> on)\n        take object 0 off -> on (now 7,1,3 -> on)\n        take object 3 off -> off (now 7 and 1 -> off). This suggests that without 3 (and without 0) the machine turns off? But note that when we had 7 and 0 without 3, the machine was on? So why is it off now? \n\n    Let me reexamine the step:\n\n        After taking object 3 off the machine (when the machine had 7,0,1,3) we get:\n            take object 3 off -> off.\n\n        But previously we had:\n            After taking object 3 off when the machine had 7,0 -> on?
