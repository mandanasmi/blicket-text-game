Put object 3 on machine -> machine off.\n6. Put object 5 on machine -> machine turns ON.\n\nAt this point, the machine turns on. This suggests that having objects 0,7,2,6,3,5 on the machine together causes the machine to turn on. But note that when we put object 5, it turned on. So it must be that object 5 is a blicket and the rule might require at least one blicket? But wait, because when we put object 5, it was the last one added and the machine turned on. However, note that the machine was off until object 5 was placed. So the rule might be that the machine turns on only when a specific set is present?

Take object 2 off -> machine remains on.\n11. Take object 0 off -> machine remains on.\n\nAt this point, only object 5 is on the machine? But wait: we started with 0,7,2,6,3,5 on the machine. Then we removed 3,7,6,2,0. So now only object 5 is on the machine? And the machine is still on? But then:\n\n12. Put object 3 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n13. Put object 2 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n14. Take object 2 off -> machine remains on.\n\nSo now we have objects 5 and 3 on the machine? (We put 3 back, then 2, then took off 2, so 5 and 3 remain.)\n\n15. Put object 1 on the machine -> machine remains on. Now we have 5, 3, and 1.\n\n16. Take object 5 off -> machine turns OFF.\n\nSo when we remove object 5, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 5 is critical. But note that after removing object 5, we have objects 3 and 1 on the machine and the machine is off. So neither 3 nor 1 alone (or together without 5) can keep the machine on? Or perhaps the machine requires object 5 to be present?\n\nBut wait, after step 16, we have:\n\n17. Put object 4 on the machine -> machine turns ON.\n\nSo we have objects 3, 1, and 4 on the machine (since we took off 5 and then put 4). And the machine turns on? But without object 5? This is confusing.\n\nLet's reconstruct the state at each step:\n\nAfter step 6: objects on machine: 0,7,2,6,3,5 -> machine on.\n\nAfter step 7: remove 3 -> objects: 0,7,2,6,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 8: remove 7 -> objects: 0,2,6,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 9: remove 6 -> objects: 0,2,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 10: remove 2 -> objects: 0,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 11: remove 0 -> objects: 5 -> machine on. (So with only 5, machine is on.)\n\nThen step 12: add 3 -> objects: 5,3 -> machine on.\nStep 13: add 2 -> objects: 5,3,2 -> machine on.\nStep 14: remove 2 -> objects: 5,3 -> machine on.\nStep 15: add 1 -> objects: 5,3,1 -> machine on.\nStep 16: remove 5 -> objects: 3,1 -> machine off. (So without 5, machine turns off.)\n\nStep 17: add 4 -> objects: 3,1,4 -> machine turns on.\n\nThis suggests that the machine can turn on without object 5? But note that when we had only 5, the machine was on. Then when we removed 5, it turned off. Then we added 4 to the existing 3 and 1 and it turned on.\n\nTherefore, the rule cannot be that only object 5 is a blicket.

The agent puts objects 0, 7, 2, 6, 3, and then 5 on the machine one by one. After putting object 5, the machine turns on.\n   - Before putting 5: objects 0,7,2,6,3 are on the machine -> machine off.\n   - After adding 5: machine on.\n\n   This suggests that the activation might require object 5. But note that when object 5 was added, there were already several objects on the machine. So it could be that 5 is a blicket, or that the combination of objects including 5 triggers the machine.\n\n3. Then the agent starts removing objects one by one: removes 3, then 7, then 6, then 2, then 0. The machine remains on after each removal.\n   - After removing 0 (so only 5 is left on the machine?

Then the agent puts object 3 back on the machine -> machine remains on. Then puts object 2 -> remains on. Then removes object 2 -> remains on. Then puts object 1 -> remains on. Then removes object 5 -> machine turns off.\n\n   This is critical: when object 5 is removed (and at that point the objects on the machine are: 3, 1, and whatever else? Let's track:\n\n   After removing object 0 (the last removal in the first removal sequence), the machine is on and the only object on the machine is object 5. Then:\n      - put 3: now 5 and 3 -> machine on.\n      - put 2: now 5,3,2 -> machine on.\n      - remove 2: now 5 and 3 -> machine on.\n      - put 1: now 5,3,1 -> machine on.\n      - remove 5: now 3 and 1 -> machine turns off.\n\n   So when 5 is removed, the machine turns off. This indicates that 5 is critical.\n\n4. Then the agent puts object 4 on the machine (which now has objects 3 and 1) and the machine turns on again.\n\n   At the time of putting 4: the objects on the machine are 3,1, and then adding 4 -> machine turns on.\n\n   But note: when we had only 5, the machine was on. Then after removing 5, with 3 and 1 the machine turned off. Then adding 4 turned it back on.\n\n   This suggests that 4 is also a blicket? Or that the machine requires at least one blicket to be present? And that 5 and 4 are blickets? But what about 3 and 1? They were present when the machine turned off after removing 5, and then adding 4 turned it on.\n\nLet's summarize the state of the machine:\n\n- When the machine first turned on: objects 0,7,2,6,3,5 were on the machine. Then by removing objects one by one (except 5) the machine remained on until only 5 was left -> so 5 alone can turn the machine on? But note that when we had only 5, the machine was on.\n\n- Then when we put 3 and 1, and then removed 5, the machine turned off -> meaning that without 5 (and without 4) the machine turned off. Then adding 4 turned it on.\n\nSo it appears that both 5 and 4 are blickets? But what about the other objects?\n\nWe also note:\n\n- After the first sequence of removals, the machine was on with only 5. Then we added 3 and 2 and 1 without turning off. But when we removed 5, it turned off. Then we added 4 and it turned on.\n\nSo the rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on the machine. And we have identified that 5 and 4 are blickets because:\n\n  - 5 alone: machine on.\n  - 4 added to non-blickets (3 and 1) turned the machine on.\n\nBut what about the other objects?

So object 4 must be a blicket.\n\nWhat about object 2? We have several interactions with object 2:\n\n- When we first put object 2 on (step 3) with others (0,7) and then more, the machine didn't turn on until we added 5. So object 2 by itself or with non-blickets didn't turn it on.\n\n- Later, after the machine was on (with object 5 and others), we removed object 2 (step 10) and the machine stayed on.

Blickets are objects that make the machine turn on, following a hidden rule.\n\nFirst, let's list all the actions and the state of the machine:\n\nInitial state: All objects on the floor, machine off.\n\nAction sequence and machine state:\n\n1. Put object 0 on machine -> machine off.\n2. Put object 7 on machine -> machine off.\n3. Put object 2 on machine -> machine off.\n4. Put object 6 on machine -> machine off.\n5. Put object 3 on machine -> machine off.\n6. Put object 5 on machine -> machine turns on.\n\nAt this point, the machine turns on. So, the set of objects on the machine when it turns on is: {0, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5}. Since it turned on when object 5 was added, we know that the activation condition was met with these objects.\n\nBut note: the machine did not turn on until object 5 was placed. So, object 5 is likely a blicket, and possibly others.\n\nNow, the agent starts removing objects:\n\n7. Take object 3 off -> machine still on. (Objects now: {0,7,2,6,5})\n8. Take object 7 off -> machine still on. (Objects: {0,2,6,5})\n9. Take object 6 off -> machine still on. (Objects: {0,2,5})\n10. Take object 2 off -> machine still on. (Objects: {0,5})\n11. Take object 0 off -> machine still on. (Objects: {5})\n\nWait, after removing object 0, only object 5 is left and the machine is still on? That suggests that object 5 alone is enough to keep the machine on? But then note:\n\nAfter step 11: \"You took object 0 off ... light now on.\" -> only object 5 is on the machine and the light is on.\n\nBut then:\n\n12. Put object 3 on the machine -> machine still on. (Objects: {5,3})\n13. Put object 2 on the machine -> machine still on. (Objects: {5,3,2})\n14. Take object 2 off -> machine still on. (Objects: {5,3})\n15. Put object 1 on the machine -> machine still on. (Objects: {5,3,1})\n16. Take object 5 off the machine -> machine turns off. (Objects: {3,1})\n\nAfter removing object 5, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 5 was critical.\n\nThen:\n\n17. Put object 4 on the machine -> machine turns on. (Objects: {3,1,4})\n\nNow, we need to infer the rule and which objects are blickets.\n\nKey observations:\n\n- When the machine first turned on, we had objects {0,7,2,6,3,5} on the machine. It turned on when object 5 was added.\n\n- After removing all objects except 5, the machine remained on (step 11). This suggests that object 5 alone can activate the machine? But note that when we had only object 5 (after step 11), the machine was on. However, let's check step 16: when we remove object 5 (and leave 3 and 1) the machine turns off. So object 5 is definitely a blicket and necessary in that context.\n\nBut then step 17: we put object 4 on the machine (which had objects 3 and 1) and the machine turns on. So now we have objects {3,1,4} and the machine is on.\n\nThis suggests that object 4 is also a blicket? Or perhaps object 3 and/or 1 are blickets?\n\nLet's try to deduce the rule.\n\nOne common rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. However, that doesn't seem to fit because:\n\n- Initially, we added several objects and the machine didn't turn on until object 5. If any blicket activates the machine, then why didn't it turn on earlier? Unless none of the first five objects (0,7,2,6,3) are blickets? But then when we added object 5 (a blicket) it turned on.\n\nBut then later, when we had only object 5, it was on. Then we added object 3 and the machine remained on. Then we added object 1 and it remained on. Then we removed object 5 and the machine turned off. This suggests that without object 5, the machine turns off even though objects 3 and 1 are present.

We need to determine if object 6 is a blicket, meaning it has the property that can make the machine turn on (according to the hidden rule).\n\nLet's recap the interactions step by step to infer the rule and the blickets:\n\n1. Initially, all objects are on the floor, machine is off.\n\n2. Actions and machine responses:\n   - Put object 0 on machine -> machine off.\n   - Put object 7 on machine -> machine off (now objects 0 and 7 are on machine).\n   - Put object 2 on machine -> machine off (objects: 0,7,2).\n   - Put object 6 on machine -> machine off (objects: 0,7,2,6).\n   - Put object 3 on machine -> machine off (objects: 0,7,2,6,3).\n   - Put object 5 on machine -> machine turns ON (objects: 0,7,2,6,3,5).\n\n   At this point, the machine turns on when object 5 is added. This suggests that object 5 might be a blicket, but note that the machine might require a specific combination.\n\n3. Then, the agent starts removing objects one by one, but the machine remains on:\n   - Remove object 3 -> machine still on (objects: 0,7,2,6,5).\n   - Remove object 7 -> machine still on (objects: 0,2,6,5).\n   - Remove object 6 -> machine still on (objects: 0,2,5).\n   - Remove object 2 -> machine still on (objects: 0,5).\n   - Remove object 0 -> machine still on (only object 5 remains).\n\n   This is critical: when only object 5 is on the machine, the machine remains on. This suggests that object 5 alone is sufficient to turn the machine on? But note that when object 5 was added, it caused the machine to turn on only when added to the existing set. However, after removing all others, the machine remains on with only 5. This implies that object 5 is a blicket and that the machine can stay on even if non-blickets are removed? Or perhaps the rule is about having at least one blicket.\n\n   However, let's continue.\n\n4. Then, the agent adds back:\n   - Put object 3 on machine -> machine remains on (objects: 5,3).\n   - Put object 2 on machine -> machine remains on (objects: 5,3,2).\n   - Remove object 2 -> machine remains on (objects: 5,3).\n   - Put object 1 on machine -> machine remains on (objects: 5,3,1).\n\n   So far, the machine is staying on.\n\n5. Then, the agent removes object 5 (the one that was alone and keeping the machine on) and the machine turns off:\n   - Take object 5 off -> machine turns off (objects: 3,1).\n\n   This indicates that without object 5, the machine turns off. Therefore, object 5 is necessary for the machine to be on at that point.\n\n6. Then, the agent puts object 4 on the machine and the machine turns on:\n   - Put object 4 on machine -> machine turns on (objects: 3,1,4).\n\n   Now, with objects 3,1,4 on the machine, the machine is on. But note that when object 5 was removed (and the machine turned off) we had objects 3 and 1 on the machine and the machine was off. Then adding object 4 turned it on.\n\n   This suggests that object 4 is also a blicket? But we must reconcile with previous observations.\n\nLet's try to infer the rule:\n\n- The machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it? But that doesn't explain the initial sequence: when objects 0,7,2,6,3 were on (all non-blickets?), the machine was off. Then adding object 5 (a blicket) turned it on. Then even after removing some non-blickets, as long as object 5 was on, the machine stayed on. Then when object 5 was removed, the machine turned off even though objects 3 and 1 were still on. Then adding object 4 turned it on again.\n\n  Therefore, it seems that the machine requires at least one blicket to be on. And the blickets we have identified so far are 5 and 4? But what about the others?\n\nNow, let's focus on object 6:\n\nIn the initial sequence, when object 6 was on the machine (along with 0,7,2,3) and then object 5 was added, the machine turned on.

We need to determine if object 7 is a blicket. Blickets are objects that make the machine turn on when placed on it, but note that the machine might require a combination of objects.\n\nFirst, let's note when the machine turns on and off:\n\nInitially, all objects are on the floor, and the machine is off.\n\nSequence of actions and machine state:\n\n1. Put object 0 -> machine off\n2. Put object 7 -> machine off\n3. Put object 2 -> machine off\n4. Put object 6 -> machine off\n5. Put object 3 -> machine off\n6. Put object 5 -> machine turns ON.\n\nSo at this point, the machine is on with objects 0,7,2,6,3,5 on the machine.\n\nThen:\n7. Take object 3 off -> machine remains on (so object 3 is not necessary to keep it on at this point? or maybe the rule is about having a specific set)\n8. Take object 7 off -> machine remains on\n9. Take object 6 off -> machine remains on\n10. Take object 2 off -> machine remains on\n11. Take object 0 off -> machine remains on (so now only object 5 is on the machine? But then we have:)\n   - After taking 0 off, the machine is still on. But then:\n\n12. Put object 3 back -> machine remains on (so now objects 5 and 3 are on the machine)\n13. Put object 2 -> machine remains on (objects 5,3,2)\n14. Take object 2 off -> machine remains on (objects 5,3)\n\n15. Put object 1 -> machine remains on (objects 5,3,1)\n\n16. Take object 5 off -> machine turns OFF.\n\nSo when object 5 is removed, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 5 is critical at that moment. But note that after removing 5, the machine is off even though objects 3 and 1 are still on.\n\nThen:\n17. Put object 4 -> machine turns ON.\n\nNow, at this point, the machine has objects 3,1,4 (since we removed 5 and then put 4). So the machine turns on when we put object 4.\n\nWe need to figure out the rule.\n\nLet me try to see the critical events:\n\n- The machine first turned on when object 5 was placed (with 0,7,2,6,3 already on). So it wasn't on until 5 was placed.\n\n- Then, after removing almost all objects (leaving only 5) the machine was still on? But note:\n\nAfter step 11: we took off 0, and the machine was on. At that point, only object 5 was on the machine? Because we had put 0,7,2,6,3,5 and then took off 3,7,6,2,0. So indeed, only 5 was left. Then:\n\nStep 12: put 3 -> machine on (so 5 and 3 are on, machine on)\nStep 13: put 2 -> machine on (5,3,2)\nStep 14: take 2 off -> machine on (5,3)\nStep 15: put 1 -> machine on (5,3,1)\nStep 16: take 5 off -> machine off (so now only 3 and 1 are on, and machine turns off)\n\nThen step 17: put 4 -> machine on (so now 3,1,4 are on)\n\nSo what can we infer?\n\n- The machine turns on only when at least one blicket is on it? But then when only 5 was on, it was on. Then when we removed 5 and left 3 and 1, it turned off. So 5 is a blicket? And then when we put 4, it turned on again? So 4 might be a blicket too?\n\nBut note that when we had 0,7,2,6,3,5 and the machine turned on only when 5 was placed, so 5 is a blicket. Also, when we put 4 later and it turned on, then 4 is a blicket.\n\nBut what about object 3? It was on the machine when the machine was on, but when we took off 5, the machine turned off even with 3 still on. So 3 is not a blicket? Similarly, object 1 was on when the machine was on (with 5 and 3) but when 5 was removed, the machine turned off even with 1 and 3. So 1 is not a blicket.\n\nNow, what about object 7?
