Take object 5 off -> light turns off.\n\n We need to infer the rule for the machine turning on and which objects are blickets.\n\n Let's denote the state of the machine after each action:\n\n Initial: objects 2 and 7 are on the machine -> light off.\n After action 1 (put 5): objects 2, 7, 5 -> light off.\n After action 2 (put 6): objects 2, 7, 5, 6 -> light on.\n After action 3 (take 2): objects 7, 5, 6 -> light on.\n After action 4 (take 7): objects 5, 6 -> light on.\n After action 5 (take 5): only object 6 remains -> light off.\n\n From the transitions:\n\n - When we add object 6 (to the existing set of 2,7,5) the light turns on. So the set {2,7,5,6} activates the machine.\n - Removing object 2 (leaving {7,5,6}) still on.\n - Removing object 7 (leaving {5,6}) still on.\n - Removing object 5 (leaving {6}) turns the machine off.\n\n Therefore, the set {5,6} is sufficient to turn the machine on? But note that when we had {5,6} the machine was on. However, when we had only {6} the machine turned off.\n\n Also note that the initial state had {2,7} and the machine was off. Then we added 5 -> still off. Then adding 6 turned it on.\n\n So what changed when we added 6? It must be that object 6 is a blicket and that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on the machine? But then why did the machine turn off when we removed 5? Because when we removed 5 we were left with only 6? That would imply that 6 is a blicket and the machine should be on. However, it turned off.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on only if there is at least one blicket and the total number of objects is at least 3? Let's check:\n\n - Initial: 2 objects (2 and 7) -> off -> consistent if 2 and 7 are not blickets? Or if the rule requires at least 3.\n - After adding 5: 3 objects -> still off. So if the rule is \"at least 3 and at least one blicket\", then in the state {2,7,5} we have 3 objects but no blicket? Then adding 6 (a blicket) would turn it on? That fits.\n\n But then when we remove 2: we have {7,5,6} -> 3 objects and at least one blicket (6) -> on. Then remove 7: {5,6} -> 2 objects. Now the machine is still on? But according to the rule we just thought (at least 3) it should turn off? But it didn't.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the machine has a memory? Or the rule is about the presence of a specific combination.\n\n Let's consider the state transitions:\n\n State 0: {2,7} -> off\n State 1: {2,7,5} -> off\n State 2: {2,7,5,6} -> on   (added 6)\n\n Why did adding 6 turn it on? It must be that 6 is a blicket and that the machine requires at least one blicket. But then when we have {5,6} (which has 6, a blicket) it should be on. But when we remove 5, leaving {6}, the machine turns off. So that suggests that having only one blicket (6) is not enough? Or that the machine requires at least two objects? But then {5,6} was on and that's two objects. And {6} is one object -> off.

Because we still had 5 and 6. And then when we removed 5, leaving only 6, it turned off. This suggests that 5 might also be a blicket? But let's check the action with 5:\n\n- When we first put 5 on (with 2 and 7 already on), the machine remained off. So 5 by itself (or in the presence of 2 and 7) did not turn the machine on.

But then when we added 5 and 6, the machine turned on after adding 6.\n\nLet's analyze the state transitions:\n\n- Initial (2 and 7): off.\n- After adding 5: still off (so 2,7,5: off).\n- After adding 6: on (so 2,7,5,6: on).\n\nThen we remove 2: still on (7,5,6: on).\nThen we remove 7: still on (5,6: on).\nThen we remove 5: off (only 6: off).\n\nNotice that when only 6 was left, the machine turned off. So 6 by itself doesn't keep the machine on? But when we had 5 and 6 together, the machine was on. And when we removed 5, leaving only 6, the machine turned off.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the possibility that the machine requires at least two blickets? But note that initially we had two objects (2 and 7) and the machine was off. So either 2 and 7 are not blickets, or they are but the rule is different.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on if there is at least one blicket and also if the total number of blickets on the machine is odd? But let's test:\n\n- State 1: 2,7 -> off. If both are blickets, then two blickets (even) -> off. If one is and one isn't, then odd (one) would be on? But we don't know.\n\nWe need to determine which objects are blickets.\n\nFrom the interaction:\n\n- When we put 5 and 6: adding 5 didn't turn it on (so 5 alone with 2 and 7 didn't change the state from off to on). Then adding 6 turned it on. So 6 must be a blicket? But note that before adding 6, we had 2,7,5 and the machine was off. After adding 6, it turned on. So 6 must be a blicket? But then when we removed everything except 6, the machine turned off. That suggests that 6 alone is not enough? So the rule might require more than one blicket?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine requires a specific blicket to be present? Let's think about the state when we had 5 and 6 on the machine (after removing 2 and 7) and the machine was on. Then removing 5 turned it off. So 5 must be a blicket? But when we added 5 initially (with 2 and 7) it didn't turn on. Then when we added 6 (with 2,7,5) it turned on. So 6 is the key? But then why did the machine stay on when we removed 2 and 7?

But when we had {5,6} the machine was on. So what is the rule?\n\nLet's think about when the machine turned on and off:\n\n- Turning on: when we added object 6 to the set {2,7,5} (which was off) to get {2,7,5,6} -> on.\n\n- Turning off: when we removed object 5 from {5,6} to get {6} -> off.\n\nAlso note:\n\n- The set {2,7} was off (initial state).\n- After adding 5 (to make {2,7,5}) -> still off.\n- Then adding 6 (to make {2,7,5,6}) -> on.\n\nSo the machine turned on when we added 6 to a set that included 5? But then when we have {5,6} without 2 and 7, it's on? And then removing 5 (leaving only 6) turns it off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on the machine? But let's test:\n\nAssume that blickets are the objects that have the power to turn the machine on by themselves? Then:\n\n- If 6 were a blicket, then when we had only 6 at the end, the machine should be on. But it was off.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when there are exactly two blickets on the machine? Or more than one?\n\nLet's look at the sets:\n\n- {2,7}: off -> so not both blickets? Or maybe neither is a blicket?\n- {2,7,5}: off -> same, so adding 5 didn't help.\n- {2,7,5,6}: on -> so this set has at least two blickets? But then when we remove 2 and 7, leaving {5,6} -> on. Then removing 5 leaves {6} -> off.\n\nSo {5,6} is on -> meaning that both 5 and 6 together are sufficient? But individually they are not? Because if 5 alone were a blicket, then when we had {2,7,5} it should have turned on? But it didn't. Similarly, 6 alone doesn't turn it on (at the end).\n\nTherefore, the rule might be that the machine turns on if both 5 and 6 are on the machine? But wait, what about the initial state? We had 2 and 7 and it was off. Then when we added 5 and 6, it turned on? Actually, we added 5 first and then 6. But when we added 5 (to 2 and 7) it remained off. Then when we added 6, it turned on. So it seems that 6 is the key?

Take object 5 off -> light turns off.\n   - Now on machine: 6 -> light off.\n\nWe need to figure out the rule for the machine turning on and which objects are blickets.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n\n- When we added object 6 to the machine (which had 2,7,5 already) the light turned on. So the set {2,7,5,6} turns the machine on.\n\n- Then we removed object 2: the set {7,5,6} still turns the machine on.\n\n- Then we removed object 7: the set {5,6} turns the machine on.\n\n- Then we removed object 5: the set {6} does not turn the machine on.\n\nSo we know:\n\n- The set {5,6} turns the machine on.\n\n- When we had {2,7,5} the machine was off. Then adding 6 turned it on. So 6 must be a blicket? But note that the set {5,6} is on and that turns the machine on.\n\nBut also, when we removed 5 from {5,6}, the machine turned off. So 5 being removed caused the machine to turn off even though 6 was still there. This suggests that 5 is necessary for the machine to be on when 6 is present? But wait, we see that the set {5,6} is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\nLet's think about blickets: Blickets are objects that cause the machine to turn on when placed. However, the rule might be more complex (e.g., requiring a specific combination).\n\nFrom the transitions:\n\n- Initially: {2,7} -> off.\n\n- Add 5: {2,7,5} -> off.\n\n- Add 6: {2,7,5,6} -> on.\n\nSo the addition of 6 turned the machine on. Therefore, 6 is a blicket? But note that when we had only {5,6} the machine was on. And when we remove 5, leaving only 6, the machine turns off. So 6 alone is not sufficient? And 5 alone? We never saw 5 alone. But in the initial step, when we added 5 to {2,7} (which was off), it remained off. So 5 alone (or with 2 and 7) didn't turn it on until 6 was added.\n\nNow, what about the other objects? We have information about objects 2 and 7:\n\n- When we removed 2 from the set that had 7,5,6 (which was on), the machine remained on. Similarly, removing 7 from {5,6} (after having removed 2) left {5,6} and the machine was still on. So 2 and 7 are not necessary for the machine to be on? But note that in the initial state, with only 2 and 7, the machine was off.\n\nSo it seems that 2 and 7 are not blickets? But we don't know the rule. Maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both 5 and 6 are on the machine? Or if at least two blickets are present?\n\nLet's list the sets that are on and the state:\n\n- {2,7} -> off (initial)\n- {2,7,5} -> off (after adding 5)\n- {2,7,5,6} -> on (after adding 6)\n- {7,5,6} -> on (after removing 2) -> so 2 is not needed\n- {5,6} -> on (after removing 7) -> so 7 is not needed\n- {6} -> off (after removing 5) -> so 5 is needed when 6 is present?

Take object 5 off the machine -> light turns off.\n   - After removal: machine has 6 -> off.\n\nWe need to infer the rule for the machine turning on. It seems the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it? But note that initially with 2 and 7 the machine was off. Then when we added 5 and 6, the machine turned on only after adding 6.\n\nLet's break down:\n\n- State 1: {2,7} -> off\n- State 2: {2,7,5} -> off (adding 5 didn't change)\n- State 3: {2,7,5,6} -> on (adding 6 turned it on)\n\nThis suggests that either 6 is a blicket and 2,7,5 are not? But then:\n\n- Remove 2: {7,5,6} -> on (still on, so 2 is not necessary for the on state)\n- Remove 7: {5,6} -> on (still on, so 7 is not necessary for the on state)\n- Remove 5: {6} -> off\n\nSo when we remove 5, the machine turns off even though 6 is still on. This implies that 6 alone cannot keep the machine on? But note that when we had {5,6} the machine was on, and when we remove 5 leaving only 6, it turns off.\n\nThis suggests that the rule might require at least two blickets? Or perhaps a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the possibility that both 5 and 6 are blickets? But then why did the machine turn on only when 6 was added? Because before adding 6, we had {2,7,5} and it was off. Then we added 6 and it turned on. So 6 must be a blicket. However, after having {5,6} and removing 5, the machine turns off. So if 6 is a blicket and we have only 6, why is the machine off? This suggests that the rule might be that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on.\n\nBut then, what about the initial state? Initially we had {2,7} and the machine was off. If the rule requires at least two blickets, then if both 2 and 7 were blickets, the machine should have been on. But it was off. So neither 2 nor 7 is a blicket? Or at least one of them isn't.\n\nLet me reexamine:\n\n- {2,7} -> off: so either both are non-blickets, or at least one is a blicket but the rule requires more than one? But then when we have {5,6} it is on. So if the rule requires at least two blickets, then {2,7} being off implies that at most one of 2 or 7 is a blicket? Actually, it implies that there are less than two blickets in {2,7}. So either zero or one blicket in that set.\n\nNow, when we add 5: {2,7,5} -> off. This still has at most one blicket? Because if 5 were a blicket, then we would have at least one blicket (if 2 or 7 is not a blicket) but still only one. Then adding 6: {2,7,5,6} -> on. This suggests that now we have at least two blickets. So 6 must be a blicket and one of the previous ones must be a blicket?

Then when we remove object 5, the light goes off even though object 6 is still on the machine.\n\nThis indicates that having only object 6 on the machine does not turn the light on (because when it's the only one, the light is off). Therefore, object 6 by itself is not sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\nBut note: when we had objects 5 and 6 together (without 2 and 7), the machine was on. Then removing 5 made it turn off. This suggests that the machine is on only when both 5 and 6 are present? Not necessarily, because we don't know about other combinations.\n\nLet's try to figure out the rule:\n\nWe know:\n- Initial state: objects 2 and 7 on machine -> light off.\n- After adding 5: still off (so 2,7,5 together don't turn it on).\n- After adding 6: turns on (so 2,7,5,6 turn it on).\n\nBut then we remove 2: 7,5,6 -> on.\nRemove 7: 5,6 -> on.\nRemove 5: 6 -> off.\n\nSo it seems that the machine is on when at least one of the objects in the set {5,6} is present? But wait, when we had only 5 (with 2 and 7) the machine was off. And when we had only 6 (after removing 5) the machine turned off.\n\nAlternatively, it might be that both 5 and 6 together are required? But note that when we had 5 and 6 together without 2 and 7, the machine was on. And when we removed one of them (5) then it turned off.\n\nHowever, what about the initial state? We had 2 and 7 without 5 or 6 and the machine was off. And adding 5 didn't turn it on. Then adding 6 turned it on.\n\nAlso, when we removed 2 and 7, the machine stayed on with 5 and 6. Then removing 5 made it turn off.\n\nSo the rule might be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 5 and object 6 are on the machine? But let's check:\n\n- In the initial state (2,7): no 5 and no 6 -> off. (fits)\n- After adding 5: (2,7,5) -> still off because 6 is missing? (fits)\n- After adding 6: (2,7,5,6) -> now both 5 and 6 are present -> on. (fits)\n- Removing 2: (7,5,6) -> still both 5 and 6 -> on. (fits)\n- Removing 7: (5,6) -> still both -> on. (fits)\n- Removing 5: (6) -> missing 5 -> off. (fits)\n\nSo the rule appears to be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 5 and object 6 are on the machine.\n\nTherefore, object 6 is necessary for the machine to turn on (along with object 5). But is object 6 a blicket?\n\nThe problem says: \"Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\" In this rule, both 5 and 6 are required. So both are blickets?

So what's the difference?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule requires two blickets? Or a specific condition.\n\nLet's list the sets that are on the machine when the machine is on and off:\n\n- {2,7}: initially on the machine? But the machine was off at the start. So the initial state had 2 and 7 on the machine and the machine was off. So {2,7} -> off.\n\nThen after adding 5: {2,7,5} -> off.\n\nThen after adding 6: {2,7,5,6} -> on.\n\nThen remove 2: {7,5,6} -> on.\n\nThen remove 7: {5,6} -> on.\n\nThen remove 5: {6} -> off.\n\nSo the machine is on when at least two of the objects on the machine are blickets? Or maybe a specific rule.\n\nNotice that when we have {5,6} the machine is on, but when we have {6} it's off. Also, when we had {2,7,5} it was off. So if we assume that the rule is that the machine turns on when there is at least one blicket, then having only 6 (if 6 is a blicket) should turn it on. But it turned off.
