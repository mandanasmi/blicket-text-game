We need to determine which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nFirst, note that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it, but the rule might be more complex. We have to infer the rule from the interactions.\n\nLet's break down the interactions step by step, keeping track of which objects are on the machine and the state of the machine (on/off).\n\nInitial state: \n- Machine: off\n- Objects on machine: [1] (since object 1 is on top initially)\n\nAction 1: put object 5 on the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [1, 5]\n- Machine: off\n\nAction 2: put object 6 on the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [1, 5, 6]\n- Machine: off\n\nAction 3: put object 2 on the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [1, 5, 6, 2]\n- Machine: turns on.\n\nSo, when object 2 is added, the machine turns on. This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket.\n\nBut note: the machine was off with [1,5,6] and then turned on when 2 was added. So object 2 is likely a blicket.\n\nAction 4: take object 6 off the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [1, 5, 2]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nAction 5: take object 1 off the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [5, 2]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nAction 6: take object 5 off the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [2]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nSo even with only object 2, the machine is on. This reinforces that object 2 is a blicket.\n\nAction 7: put object 1 on the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [2, 1]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nAction 8: put object 3 on the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [2, 1, 3]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nAction 9: take object 2 off the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [1, 3]\n- Machine: turns off.\n\nThis is critical: when object 2 (which we thought was a blicket) is removed, the machine turns off even though objects 1 and 3 are still on. This suggests that object 2 is necessary to keep the machine on, and objects 1 and 3 alone are not sufficient.\n\nBut note: in action 5, we took object 1 off when [5,2] were on and the machine stayed on. Then we took 5 off and only 2 was left and it was on. So object 1 is not a blicket? However, in action 7 we put object 1 back and the machine was still on (with 2 present). Then we added 3 and the machine stayed on. But when we removed 2, the machine turned off. So without 2, the machine turns off.\n\nNow, what about object 1? It was on the machine initially and the machine was off until object 2 was added. So object 1 is not a blicket? But let's see:\n\nAction 10: put object 0 on the machine.\n- At this point, machine is off (after removing 2, leaving [1,3] and machine off). So we put 0 on.\n- Objects on machine: [1, 3, 0]\n- Machine: turns on.\n\nWait, this is interesting. With objects [1,3,0] the machine turns on. But earlier with [1,3] it was off. So one of 0,1,3 must be a blicket? But note that we just added 0 and then it turned on. So object 0 might be a blicket.\n\nBut let's see: when we had [1,3] the machine was off, then we added 0 and it turned on. So 0 is likely a blicket.\n\nAction 11: put object 6 on the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [1,3,0,6]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nAction 12: take object 1 off the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [3,0,6]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nAction 13: take object 6 off the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [3,0]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nAction 14: take object 3 off the machine.\n- Objects on machine: [0]\n- Machine: remains on.\n\nSo even with only object 0, the machine is on.

Then we added 2 and it turned on.\n\nSo, object 1,5,6 together do not turn the machine on, but adding 2 does.

This confirms that object 2 is a blicket and that the machine can be turned on by having at least one blicket? But note that initially when only object 1 was on the machine, the machine was off.

Or at least not the only ones required.\n\nBut note: when we had only object 2, the machine was on. Now we have objects 1 and 3 without 2 and the machine is off. So object 1 and 3 are not blickets?

We need to determine if object 2 is a blicket.\n Blickets are objects that make the machine turn on when placed, but note that the machine might require a specific combination or rule.\n\n Let's analyze the interactions step by step to infer the rule and the status of each object.\n\n Initial state:\n   Objects on machine: [1] (since object1 is on top initially)\n   Objects on floor: [0,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n   Machine is off.\n\n Step 1: put object5 on machine -> machine remains off.\n   Now on machine: [1,5]\n   Machine off.\n\n Step 2: put object6 on machine -> machine remains off.\n   Now on machine: [1,5,6]\n   Machine off.\n\n Step 3: put object2 on machine -> machine turns on.\n   Now on machine: [1,5,6,2]\n   Machine on.\n\n   This suggests that adding object2 caused the machine to turn on. But note that it was added to an existing set that did not turn the machine on (with 1,5,6). So object2 might be a blicket? However, we must check if the machine turns on only when a blicket is present and perhaps a condition.\n\n Step 4: take object6 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [1,5,2]\n   Machine on.\n\n Step 5: take object1 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [5,2]\n   Machine on.\n\n Step 6: take object5 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [2]\n   Machine on.\n\n   This is critical: with only object2 on the machine, the machine is on. This suggests that object2 is a blicket and can activate the machine alone? But wait, let's check further.\n\n Step 7: put object1 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [2,1]\n   Machine on.\n\n Step 8: put object3 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [2,1,3]\n   Machine on.\n\n Step 9: take object2 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n   Now on machine: [1,3]\n   Machine off.\n\n   This step shows that removing object2 caused the machine to turn off even though objects1 and3 are still on. This suggests that object2 is critical for the machine to be on in this configuration.\n\n Step 10: put object0 on the machine -> machine turns on.\n   Now on machine: [1,3,0]\n   Machine on.\n\n   This is interesting because without object2, adding object0 turned the machine on. So object0 might be a blicket? But note that object1 and3 were already present and the machine was off until object0 was added.\n\n Step 11: put object6 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [1,3,0,6]\n   Machine on.\n\n Step 12: take object1 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [3,0,6]\n   Machine on.\n\n Step 13: take object6 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [3,0]\n   Machine on.\n\n Step 14: take object3 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: [0]\n   Machine on.\n\n   This shows that with only object0 on the machine, the machine is on. Therefore, object0 is a blicket.\n\n Step 15: put object5 on the machine -> machine remains on (since it was already on with object0, and adding non-blicket doesn't turn it off?

We need to determine if object 3 is a blicket. Blickets are objects that cause the machine to turn on when placed, but note that the machine might require a specific set or condition.\n\nFirst, let's note the initial state:\n- Objects on machine: object 1 (since it's on top initially)\n- Machine light: off\n\nNow, we go step by step to see when the machine turns on and off, and try to infer the rule.\n\n1. Action: put object 5 -> machine remains off.\n2. Action: put object 6 -> machine remains off.\n3. Action: put object 2 -> machine turns ON.\n\nAt this point, the machine has objects: 1 (initially), 5, 6, and then 2 is added. When 2 is added, the machine turns on. So the set {1,5,6,2} is on the machine and the light turns on. But note that before adding 2, the set {1,5,6} did not turn the machine on.\n\n4. Action: take object 6 off -> machine remains on. So without 6, the machine is still on. The set now is {1,5,2}.\n5. Action: take object 1 off -> machine remains on. Now set is {5,2}.\n6. Action: take object 5 off -> machine remains on. Now set is {2}. So with only object 2, the machine is on? But then we note that after taking 5 off, the machine is still on. Then we have only object 2. So it seems object 2 alone can keep the machine on? But wait, let's see the next steps.\n\n7. Action: put object 1 -> machine remains on. Now set: {2,1}.\n8. Action: put object 3 -> machine remains on. Now set: {2,1,3}.\n9. Action: take object 2 off -> machine turns OFF. Now set: {1,3}. So when we remove object 2, the machine turns off. That suggests object 2 is critical.\n\n10. Action: put object 0 -> machine turns ON. Now set: {1,3,0}.\n11. Action: put object 6 -> machine remains on. Set: {1,3,0,6}.\n12. Action: take object 1 off -> machine remains on. Set: {3,0,6}.\n13. Action: take object 6 off -> machine remains on. Set: {3,0}.\n14. Action: take object 3 off -> machine remains on. Set: {0}. So now only object 0 is on the machine and the light is on? This suggests object 0 alone can keep the machine on.\n\nBut wait, let's check the next steps to see if that holds.\n\n15. Action: put object 5 -> machine remains on. Set: {0,5}.\n16. Action: put object 2 -> machine remains on. Set: {0,5,2}.\n17. Action: put object 1 -> machine remains on. Set: {0,5,2,1}.\n18. Action: put object 6 -> machine remains on. Set: {0,5,2,1,6}.\n19. Action: take object 6 off -> machine remains on. Set: {0,5,2,1}.\n20. Action: put object 4 -> machine remains on. Set: {0,5,2,1,4}.\n21. Action: put object 6 -> machine remains on. Set: {0,5,2,1,4,6}.\n22. Action: take object 0 off -> machine remains on. Set: {5,2,1,4,6}.\n23. Action: take object 2 off -> machine turns OFF. Set: {5,1,4,6}.\n\nNow, note that when we take object 2 off, the machine turns off. So object 2 seems to be critical again.\n\n24. Action: put object 7 -> machine remains off. Set: {5,1,4,6,7}. So adding 7 doesn't turn it on.\n\nFrom the above, we can see a pattern: the machine turns on only when object 2 or object 0 is present? But let's check:\n\n- In step 3: when we added object 2 to {1,5,6} (which were not turning the machine on) it turned on. Then when we removed 2 in step 9, it turned off. Similarly, when we put 0 in step 10, it turned on. And when we removed 0 in step 22, the machine remained on because we still had 2?

But wait, we just removed 5 and the light is still on? Then only 2 is on the machine and the light is on.\n\n   This suggests that object 2 alone can turn on the machine? But note that the machine was already on from step 3. We don't know if the machine stays on when we remove non-blickets? Actually, the machine might require at least one blicket to stay on? Or the rule might be about the set of objects.\n\n   However, after step 6, we have only object 2 on the machine and the light is on.

But note that in step 6, we had only object 2 and it was on. So why when we have 1 and 3 without 2, it turns off?\n\n   This implies that neither object 1 nor object 3 is a blicket? Because if they were, the machine should have stayed on? Unless the rule is that at least one blicket must be present and object 2 is the only blicket so far.\n\n   Alternatively, the rule might be that the machine requires a specific set. But we have to see.\n\n   However, note that in step 5 we took object 1 off and the machine stayed on (with 5 and 2, then 2 alone). So object 1 is not necessary. Also, in step 6 we took object 5 off and the machine stayed on (with 2). So object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n10. > put object 0 on the machine -> light turns ON.\n    - Now: 1, 3, and 0 -> on?

So object 2 alone is enough to turn the machine on? But wait, initially when object 1 was on the machine alone, the light was off (from initial state). So object 2 must be a blicket and object 1 is not? However, note that in step 3, when we added 2 to the existing set, the light turned on.

So object 2 was essential to keep the light on? But note that after step 9, we have objects 1 and 3 on the machine and the light is off.\n\n10. > put object 0 on the machine\n    - After: objects on machine: 1,3,0 -> light turns on.\n\n    So adding object 0 to the machine (which had 1 and 3) turned the light on. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket? But note that we had 1 and 3 and the light was off, then adding 0 turned it on.\n\n11. > put object 6 on the machine\n    - After: objects on machine: 1,3,0,6 -> light remains on.\n\n12. > take object 1 off the machine\n    - After: objects on machine: 3,0,6 -> light remains on.\n\n13. > take object 6 off the machine\n    - After: objects on machine: 3,0 -> light remains on.\n\n14. > take object 3 off the machine\n    - After: objects on machine: 0 -> light remains on.\n\n    Now we have only object 0 on the machine and the light is on.
