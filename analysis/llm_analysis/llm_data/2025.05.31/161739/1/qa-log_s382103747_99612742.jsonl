The light turns on? Actually, it was already on? Let me check:\n  - After action 4, the light was on (with only object 2). Then adding object 1: the light is now on? The history says \"the light on the machine is now on\" \u2014 but it was already on? So no change? Or perhaps it was off? Let's re-read:\n\nActually, the history says after action 5: \"You put object 1 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" But if the light was already on (from having only object 2) then this doesn't tell us much.\n\nBut note: after action 4, the machine was on (with only object 2). Then we add object 1 and the light is still on. So that doesn't change.\n\nAction 6: take object 2 off the machine.\n- Now we remove object 2. The light turns off.\n- At this point, only object 1 is on the machine.\n\nSo when we removed object 2, the light turned off. This suggests that object 2 is critical for the machine to be on when it was the only one? But wait, when we had only object 2 (after action 4) the light was on. Then we added object 1 and it stayed on. Then removing object 2 (leaving object 1) turned it off.\n\nThis implies that object 2 is a blicket and object 1 might not be? Or perhaps the rule requires at least one blicket? But then why did the light turn off when we removed object 2? Because then we had only object 1 and the light went off.\n\nSo object 1 alone doesn't turn the machine on? And object 2 alone does? \n\nBut let's also note the initial state: object 7 was on the machine and the light was off. Then adding object 2 turned it on. Then removing object 7 left the light on (with only object 2). Then we added object 1 and the light stayed on? Then removing object 2 turned it off.\n\nSo it seems that object 2 is a blicket and object 1 is not? But when we added object 1 to object 2, the light stayed on. Then removing object 2 left object 1 and the light turned off. So object 1 is not a blicket? \n\nBut let's continue.\n\nAction 7: put object 0 on the machine (now we have object 1 and object 0). The light remains off? The history says \"currently off\". So adding object 0 to object 1 (which was already on the machine) did not turn the machine on.\n\nAction 8: put object 4 on the machine (now objects: 1,0,4). Light remains off.\n\nAction 9: put object 6 on the machine (objects: 1,0,4,6). Light remains off.\n\nAction 10: put object 5 on the machine (objects: 1,0,4,6,5). The light turns on.\n\nSo when we added object 5, the light turned on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket? Because until then the machine was off, and adding object 5 turned it on.\n\nAction 11: take object 4 off the machine (now objects: 1,0,6,5). The light remains on?

Our goal is to determine whether object 7 is a blicket.\n\nRecall: Blickets make the machine turn on, but we must infer the rule.\n\nLet's list the state of the machine (on/off) after each action:\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: object 7 (only)\n- Machine light: off\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. > put object 2 on the machine\n   - Before: objects on machine: [7] -> machine off\n   - After: objects on machine: [7, 2] -> machine on\n   - So: adding 2 turns the machine on.\n\n2. > take object 7 off the machine\n   - Before: [7,2] -> on\n   - After: [2] -> on\n   - So: removing 7 leaves the machine on.\n\n3. > put object 7 on the machine\n   - Before: [2] -> on\n   - After: [2,7] -> on\n   - So: adding 7 to an already on state doesn't change (still on).\n\n4. > take object 7 off the machine\n   - Before: [2,7] -> on\n   - After: [2] -> on\n   - Again: removing 7 leaves the machine on.\n\n5. > put object 1 on the machine\n   - Before: [2] -> on\n   - After: [2,1] -> on\n   - So: adding 1 to [2] (which was on) keeps it on.\n\n6. > take object 2 off the machine\n   - Before: [2,1] -> on\n   - After: [1] -> off\n   - So: removing 2 turns the machine off.\n\n7. > put object 0 on the machine\n   - Before: [1] -> off\n   - After: [1,0] -> off\n   - Adding 0 doesn't turn it on.\n\n8. > put object 4 on the machine\n   - Before: [1,0] -> off\n   - After: [1,0,4] -> off\n   - Still off.\n\n9. > put object 6 on the machine\n   - Before: [1,0,4] -> off\n   - After: [1,0,4,6] -> off\n   - Still off.\n\n10. > put object 5 on the machine\n    - Before: [1,0,4,6] -> off\n    - After: [1,0,4,6,5] -> on\n    - Adding 5 turns the machine on.\n\n11. > take object 4 off the machine\n    - Before: [1,0,4,6,5] -> on\n    - After: [1,0,6,5] -> on\n    - Removing 4 leaves the machine on.\n\n12. > take object 5 off the machine\n    - Before: [1,0,6,5] -> on\n    - After: [1,0,6] -> off\n    - Removing 5 turns the machine off.\n\n13. > put object 3 on the machine\n    - Before: [1,0,6] -> off\n    - After: [1,0,6,3] -> off\n    - Adding 3 doesn't turn it on.\n\nNow, we need to infer the rule for the machine turning on.\n\nFrom the interactions, we can note:\n\n- Initially, only object 7 is on the machine and the machine is off. So object 7 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n- When object 2 is added to 7, the machine turns on. So either 2 is a blicket, or both together are required? But note that after removing 7, we have only 2 and the machine remains on. So object 2 alone can keep the machine on? However, when we remove 2 (step 6) from [2,1], the machine turns off. So it seems that object 2 is critical.\n\nBut let's look at step 10: when we have [1,0,4,6] (which is off) and then add 5, the machine turns on. Then when we remove 5 (step 12), the machine turns off. So object 5 also seems to be a blicket.\n\nAlso, note step 6: when we remove 2 from [2,1] (which was on), the machine turns off. But when we had only 2 (step 2 and 4) the machine was on. So object 2 by itself can turn the machine on? But wait, initially we had 7 alone and it was off. Then we added 2 and it turned on.
