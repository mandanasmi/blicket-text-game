That suggests that the machine was on because of the presence of both? Or because of the presence of object 2 and object 3 together? But note that after removing object 3, only object 2 remains and the machine turns off. So object 2 alone doesn't turn it on.\n\nSo the machine turned on only when both were present.

However, at that point only object 2 is on the machine. So why did it turn off? Let me reexamine:\n\nAfter step 2: objects 2 and 3 are on the machine -> machine is on.\nStep 3: remove object 3 -> now only object 2 is on the machine, and the machine turns off.\n\nThis indicates that having only object 2 on the machine does not keep the machine on? But wait, in step 2 when we added object 2 to object 3 (which was already on the machine and not causing activation) the machine turned on. So the activation must have been caused by the combination of object 2 and object 3? Or by object 2 alone?\n\nActually, the machine turned on when we added object 2 to the existing object 3. Then when we removed object 3 (leaving only object 2) the machine turned off. This suggests that the machine requires both object 2 and object 3 to be on at the same time? But note that at the moment we put object 2 on (when object 3 was already there), the machine turned on. Then when we removed object 3, it turned off.\n\nSo the rule might be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 2 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\nBut what about object 1? We have no direct evidence about object 1 because it was never placed on the machine.\n\nHowever, note that in the initial state, the machine was off and no objects were on it. Then we put object 3 (alone) and it remained off. Then we put object 2 (with 3) and it turned on. Then we removed 3 and it turned off.\n\nThis suggests that object 2 alone is not sufficient (because when we removed 3 and left 2, the machine turned off) and object 3 alone is not sufficient (as seen in the first step). But together they activate the machine.\n\nTherefore, the rule might be that the machine turns on only when both object 2 and object 3 are present.\n\nBut what about other objects? We have no information about them. However, the question is about object 1: is it a blicket?\n\nA blicket is defined as an object that makes the machine turn on.

This implies that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine is on only when both object 2 and object 3 are present? However, we are asked about object 2 being a blicket.\n\nLet's think about what a blicket is: an object that can make the machine turn on (under the hidden rule).\n\nFrom the interaction:\n- Having object 3 alone does not turn the machine on.\n- Having both 2 and 3 turns it on.\n- Removing 3 (leaving 2 alone) turns it off.\n\nThis suggests that object 2 alone is not sufficient to turn the machine on. However, when object 2 is added to object 3, the machine turns on. Therefore, object 2 must be a blicket because it is part of the set that causes the machine to turn on. Moreover, the rule might be that the machine turns on only when at least two blickets are present? Or it could be a specific pair.\n\nBut note: we don't have enough information to know the exact rule. However, the question is only about whether object 2 is a blicket.\n\nIn the context of blickets, we can reason:\n\n- If an object is a blicket, it has the property that it can cause the machine to turn on (in some context). Even if it requires another blicket to be present, it still is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, since the machine turned on when object 2 was added to object 3, and without object 2 (when only object 3 was there) it was off, we can conclude that object 2 is a blicket. Also, note that when we removed object 3, the machine turned off, meaning that object 2 alone is not enough. But that doesn't mean object 2 isn't a blicket. It just means the rule might require more than one blicket.\n\nSo, object 2 is a blicket.\n\nBut let's check if there's any alternative: Could the machine have turned on because of object 2 alone? The sequence says after putting object 2 (with object 3 already on) the machine turned on. Then when we remove object 3, the machine turns off. So clearly, object 2 alone does not keep the machine on. However, the activation happened when object 2 was placed on top of object 3. This suggests that both are required for the machine to be on. Therefore, both are blickets? Or is it that one is a blicket and the other is a necessary non-blicket? But the problem states that blickets make the machine turn on. So if an object is necessary for turning on, it should be a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine turns on only when both 2 and 3 are present. Then both are blickets.

The machine turns on only when at least one blicket is on it? Or is there a more complex rule?\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on it:\n   - When object 3 is alone on the machine, the machine is off. This implies that object 3 is not a blicket (if it were, the machine would have turned on when it was alone).\n   - Then, when object 2 is added (with object 3 already on), the machine turns on. Since object 3 is not a blicket, the turning on must be due to object 2. So object 2 must be a blicket.\n   - After removing object 3, we have only object 2 (a blicket) on the machine, so the machine should remain on. But in the history, the machine turns off when object 3 is removed. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the rule cannot be simply that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present.\n\n2. Consider an alternative rule: the machine might require exactly two blickets? Or a specific combination.\n\nBut note the transitions:\n- Initially, no objects: off.\n- Only 3: off.\n- 3 and 2: on.\n- Then remove 3: only 2: off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine turns on only when both 2 and 3 are present? But that would mean both are blickets? However, we are only asked about object 3.\n\nBut wait, what if the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both object 2 and object 3 are on the machine? Then:\n- When only 3 is on: off (correct).\n- When 3 and 2 are on: on (correct).\n- When only 2 is on: off (correct).\n\nIn this case, both object 2 and object 3 are necessary for the machine to turn on. However, the definition of a blicket is that it makes the machine turn on. But note: individually, neither object 2 nor object 3 turns the machine on. Only together do they turn it on.\n\nSo what does that imply for being a blicket? The problem says: \"Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\" It does not say that each blicket individually turns the machine on. It could be that the blickets are part of a system and the rule might require multiple.\n\nHowever, in typical blicket experiments, an object is a blicket if it has the causal power to turn the machine on (sometimes by itself, sometimes in combination). But note that the machine turning on when both are present does not necessarily mean each is a blicket. It could be that only one of them is the blicket and the other is a catalyst? But the problem does not specify.\n\nBut let's look at the evidence:\n\n- When object 3 is placed alone, the machine does not turn on. This suggests that object 3 alone is not sufficient to turn the machine on. Therefore, if we define a blicket as an object that can cause the machine to turn on (by itself or in combination with others), then we cannot rule out that object 3 is a blicket because it did cause the machine to turn on when placed with object 2.\n\nHowever, note that when we remove object 3, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 3 was necessary to keep the machine on. Therefore, object 3 must be a blicket? But then why didn't it turn the machine on when placed alone?\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nThe machine turned on when both 2 and 3 were on. Therefore, the presence of both 2 and 3 is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\nWhen only 2 was on (after removing 3), the machine turned off.

So object 3 alone does not turn on the machine.\n- When both object 3 and object 2 were on the machine, the machine turned on.\n- Then, when object 3 was removed (leaving only object 2), the machine turned off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine turns on only when both object 2 and object 3 are on it? But wait, let's think again:\n\nIn step 2, when we added object 2 to the machine (which already had object 3), the machine turned on. Then, when we removed object 3 (so only object 2 remained), the machine turned off.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\n- Object 2 is necessary for the machine to be on? But note that when object 2 was added (with object 3 already present) the machine turned on, and when we removed object 3 (leaving only object 2) the machine turned off. This suggests that object 2 alone is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the rule:\n\nPossibility 1: The rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if both object 2 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\nBut note that we haven't tested other objects. However, we are asked about object 4.\n\nWe have no direct evidence about object 4 because it was never placed on the machine.\n\nBut the question is: Is object 4 a blicket?\n\nWe must remember the definition: Blickets are objects that make the machine turn on. However, note that the rule might be more complex (like requiring a specific combination).\n\nFrom the interactions, we see that the machine turned on only when both object 2 and object 3 were on. But when we removed object 3, the machine turned off. This suggests that both are required for the machine to be on.\n\nHowever, note that in the first step, when only object 3 was on, the machine was off. Then when we added object 2 (so both were on), it turned on. Then removing object 3 (leaving only object 2) turned it off.\n\nSo we can deduce:\n\n- Object 3 alone is not a blicket (because it didn't turn the machine on when alone).\n- Object 2 alone is not a blicket (because when it was alone at the end, the machine was off).\n\nBut when both were present, the machine turned on. Therefore, the rule might be that the machine turns on if both object 2 and object 3 are present.\n\nBut what about the other objects? We haven't tested them.\n\nHowever, note that the problem states that \"blickets make the machine turn on\". But the rule might be that the machine requires at least two blickets? Or a specific set?\n\nBut in this case, we have two objects that together cause the machine to turn on. So both object 2 and object 3 might be blickets? But individually they don't turn it on.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine turns on if object 2 is present and at least one other object (which is a blicket) is present? But we don't know.\n\nBut note: when we had only object 3 (which we now know is not a blicket by itself) and then we added object 2, the machine turned on. So object 2 must be a blicket? But then why did the machine turn off when we removed object 3? Because without object 3, we only have object 2 and that should be a blicket?

So with only object 2, the machine is off.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent because when we added object 2 to object 3, it turned on. Then removing object 3 (leaving only object 2) made it turn off.\n\nSo perhaps the machine requires both object 2 and object 3 to be on at the same time? That would explain:\n\n- Step 1: Only 3 -> off (because 2 is missing).\n- Step 2: Both 2 and 3 -> on.\n- Step 3: Remove 3, leaving only 2 -> off (because 3 is now missing).\n\nAlternatively, it could be that object 2 is a blicket and object 3 is not, but that wouldn't explain why the machine turned on when both were present. Because if only object 2 were a blicket, then when we add object 2 (to the existing object 3) the machine should turn on because of object 2. But then when we remove object 3 (non-blicket), the machine should still be on because object 2 is still there. But in the history, after removing object 3, the machine turns off.\n\nTherefore, the rule must involve both objects 2 and 3. Specifically, it seems that the machine turns on only when both are present.\n\nSo the rule might be: The machine turns on if and only if both object 2 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\nBut note: the question is about object 5. We have no information about object 5 because it hasn't been tested. However, we can infer that the rule might be specific to objects 2 and 3.\n\nBut let's consider: what if there are other blickets? The rule might be that the machine requires at least one blicket? But the interactions don't support that because:\n\n- If only object 3 is on (non-blicket) -> off.\n- Then adding object 2 (blicket) -> on (if we assume object 2 is a blicket and object 3 is not).\n\nBut then when we remove object 3 (non-blicket) we are left with object 2 (blicket) so it should stay on. But it turned off. Therefore, object 3 must be necessary for the machine to be on. So object 3 must also be a blicket? But wait, if object 3 is a blicket, then why did the machine not turn on when only object 3 was on? Because maybe the machine requires more than one blicket? Or a specific set?\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine turns on only when exactly two objects are on the machine and they are object 2 and object 3? But that seems too specific.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on if and only if object 2 is on the machine and object 3 is on the machine. So both are required.\n\nIn that case, object 2 and object 3 are both blickets? But note, the definition of a blicket is that it makes the machine turn on. However, individually they don't turn the machine on. Only together they do. So we might have to consider that the rule is conjunctive.\n\nBut note: the typical blicket experiments often involve disjunctive rules (at least one blicket) or conjunctive (all blickets). However, here the rule seems to be that both 2 and 3 are required. So we can think of them as blickets but the rule is conjunctive for activation.\n\nBut the question is: \"is object 5 a blicket?\".\n\nWe have no interaction with object 5.

But that would be a specific rule for these two. However, we are asked about object 6.\n\nBut note: the rule might be more general. We have limited data.\n\nWhat can we say about blickets?\n\n- Since the machine turned on when both 2 and 3 were present, at least one of them must be a blicket? But which one?\n\nConsider:\n- If object 3 were a blicket, then when it was alone, the machine should have turned on? But it didn't. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket? \n- Then object 2 must be the blicket? But when object 2 was alone (after removal of 3) the machine turned off. That would imply that having a blicket (object 2) alone does not turn the machine on? Then what does?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on only when exactly two objects are on it? But we don't have evidence for that because we only tried one and then two.\n\nBut note: when object 3 was alone -> off. Then adding object 2 (so two objects) -> on. Then removing one (so back to one object, object 2) -> off.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with an AND rule: the machine turns on only when both object 2 AND object 3 are present. But that would mean that the machine doesn't care about other objects? Then object 2 and 3 are the only ones that matter? And in that case, the blicket property might not even be the right way to think? However, the problem states that blickets make the machine turn on following a hidden rule.\n\nAlternatively, the hidden rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if there is at least one blicket on it? But then:\n\n- When object 3 was alone, machine off -> so object 3 is not a blicket.\n- Then when object 2 was added, machine on -> so object 2 must be a blicket? Then when we remove object 3 (leaving only object 2) the machine should stay on? But in the history, after removing object 3, the machine turned off. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the rule cannot be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on only when a specific set of objects is present?

The hidden rule we have so far might be that the machine requires the presence of object 2 and object 3? Then object 2 and 3 are blickets? But then why didn't object 3 alone turn it on?

But note that if the rule is an AND of 2 and 3, then individually neither is a blicket? Because individually they don't cause the machine to activate. But together they do.\n\n However, in the context of blicket experiments, sometimes blickets are defined as objects that have the property that when placed on the machine, they can cause it to activate, even if in conjunction with others.\n\n But note: the machine doesn't activate with just one of them. So we might say that both are blickets because they are part of the set that activates the machine.\n\n However, let's see the classic definition: a blicket is an object that makes the machine go. In the conjunctive case, both are necessary.\n\n So typically, both would be considered blickets.\n\n Now, what about object 7? We have never seen it on the machine.
