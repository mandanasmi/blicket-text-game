Machine on.\n\n   This is crucial: with only object 2 on the machine, the machine is on. Therefore, object 2 alone can turn the machine on. So object 2 is a blicket.\n\n   Also, note that when we had object 0 and 1, the machine was off. Then adding 2 turned it on. Then removing 1 and 0 left only 2 and it stayed on. This confirms that object 2 is a blicket and that the machine can be turned on by a single blicket? But then why didn't it turn on when we put object 0? Because object 0 is not a blicket? And object 1 might not be either.\n\n5. > put object 6 on the machine\n   Result: Machine remains on.\n   Objects: 2 and 6.

Machine off.\n\n   This is very important: when we remove object 2 (which we know is a blicket) and leave only object 6, the machine turns off. This implies that object 6 alone is not sufficient to keep the machine on. Therefore, object 6 is not a blicket? Or maybe the rule requires a specific set? But note that when only object 2 was present, the machine was on. So the rule seems to be: the machine is on if and only if at least one blicket is on it.\n\n   Therefore, object 6 is not a blicket because when it was the only object on the machine, the machine turned off.\n\n7. > put object 7 on the machine\n   Result: Machine turns on.\n   Objects: 6 and 7. Machine on.\n\n   Now, the machine was off (only object 6 was on) and we added object 7, and the machine turned on. Therefore, object 7 is a blicket? Because it turned the machine on when added to object 6 (which we know is not a blicket). So the machine turned on because of object 7. Therefore, object 7 is a blicket.\n\n8. > put object 0 on the machine\n   Result: Machine remains on.\n   Objects: 6, 7, and 0. Machine on.\n\n   This doesn't tell us about object 0 because the machine was already on.\n\n9. > put object 5 on the machine\n   Result: Machine remains on.\n   Objects: 6, 7, 0, 5.

So object 1 by itself does not turn the machine on.\n\nAfter step 2: we have [1,0,2] and the machine turns on. Then we remove object 1 -> [0,2] -> still on. Then remove object 0 -> [2] -> still on. This implies that object 2 is sufficient to keep the machine on? But note that the machine turned on when we added object 2 to [1,0]. However, when we are left with only object 2, the machine is on. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself.\n\nBut let's see the next steps.\n\nStep 5: put object 6 on the machine -> light remains on.\n  - Before: [2] -> on\n  - After: [2,6] -> on\n  - This doesn't change the state.\n\nStep 6: take object 2 off the machine -> light turns off.\n  - Before: [2,6] -> on\n  - After: [6] -> off\n  - This indicates that without object 2, the machine turns off.

We need to determine if object 7 is a blicket.\n A blicket is an object that makes the machine turn on when placed, but note that the machine might require multiple blickets or have other rules.\n\n Let's break down the interactions step by step to infer the rule and the blickets:\n\n Initial state: \n   Machine has object 1 on it (from the initial observation). The light is off.\n\n 1. > put object 0 on the machine\n    -> Light remains off.\n\n 2. > put object 2 on the machine\n    -> Light turns on.\n\n    At this point, the machine has: object 1 (already there), object 0, and object 2.\n    The light was off until object 2 was added. So adding object 2 made the light turn on.\n\n 3. > take object 1 off the machine\n    -> Light remains on.\n    Now machine has object 0 and object 2.\n\n 4. > take object 0 off the machine\n    -> Light remains on.\n    Now machine has only object 2.\n\n 5. > put object 6 on the machine\n    -> Light remains on.\n    Now machine has object 2 and object 6.\n\n 6. > take object 2 off the machine\n    -> Light turns off.\n    Now machine has only object 6, and the light is off.\n\n    This suggests that object 2 was critical for the light being on. When object 2 was removed, the light went off even though object 6 was still on the machine.\n\n 7. > put object 7 on the machine\n    -> Light turns on.\n    Now machine has object 6 and object 7.\n\n 8. > put object 0 on the machine\n    -> Light remains on.\n    Now machine has object 6, 7, and 0.\n\n 9. > put object 5 on the machine\n    -> Light remains on.\n    Now machine has object 6, 7, 0, 5.\n\n10. > take object 7 off the machine\n    -> Light turns off.\n    Now machine has object 6, 0, 5.\n\n    This suggests that when object 7 was removed, the light turned off. Therefore, object 7 was critical at that moment.\n\n11. > put object 4 on the machine\n    -> Light remains off.\n    Now machine has object 6, 0, 5, 4.\n\n12. > put object 3 on the machine\n    -> Light remains off.\n    Now machine has object 6, 0, 5, 4, 3.\n\n From the above, we can see:\n\n - When object 2 was placed (step 2) and the machine turned on, we then removed other objects and the light stayed on until we removed object 2 (step 6). Then the light went off. So object 2 is a blicket.\n\n - When object 7 was placed (step 7) and the machine turned on (with object 6 already present). Then when we removed object 7 (step 10), the light went off. So object 7 is also a blicket.\n\n But note: In step 6, after taking object 2 off (leaving only object 6), the light went off. Then we put object 7 and the light came on. This suggests that object 6 alone is not a blicket, but together with object 7 the machine turns on. And when we remove object 7 (step 10), the light goes off even though object 6 is still there. So object 7 is necessary for the light to be on in that configuration.\n\n However, we also have step 8 and 9: we added object 0 and object 5 and the light stayed on until we removed object 7. Then when we removed object 7, the light went off. This reinforces that object 7 is a blicket and is critical.\n\n Now, what about object 6? In step 5, we put object 6 on the machine when object 2 was already there and the light stayed on. But when object 2 was removed (step 6) leaving only object 6, the light went off. Then when we added object 7 (step 7) the light turned on. This suggests that object 6 alone does not turn the machine on, but it might be a blicket that requires another blicket? However, note that when we have object 6 and 7, the machine is on. Then we remove 7 and it goes off. So 7 is definitely a blicket.\n\n But let's consider the rule: It might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it?
