Put object 0 on the machine -> Machine remains off.\n3. Put object 4 on the machine -> Machine turns on.\n\nAt this point, we have objects 6, 0, and 4 on the machine. The machine turned on when we added object 4. So, the activation must involve object 4. But note that objects 6 and 0 were already on the machine and did not cause the machine to turn on by themselves or together. Therefore, the rule might require object 4 to be present.\n\n4. Take object 0 off the machine -> Machine remains on.\n   - After removing object 0, the machine is still on. So object 0 being removed does not turn off the machine. This suggests that object 0 might not be necessary for keeping the machine on? But note that the machine was turned on when we added object 4 with 6 and 0 already present. Now, without object 0, the machine stays on. So perhaps object 0 is not a blicket? Or the rule might be that having object 4 is sufficient? But let's see the next step.\n\n5. Take object 6 off the machine -> Machine turns off.\n\nNow, after removing object 6, the machine turns off. So at this point, we have only object 4 on the machine? But when we had objects 6, 0, and 4, the machine was on. Then we removed 0 -> still on. Then we removed 6 -> off. So what changed? Now the machine has only object 4.\n\nBut note: when we first put object 4 on the machine (with 6 and 0 already there), the machine turned on. Then we removed 0 and the machine stayed on. Then we removed 6 and the machine turned off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on? Or a specific combination?\n\nLet's think about the objects:\n\n- When we had only 6 and 0 (after step 2), the machine was off. So 6 and 0 together are not sufficient.\n- Adding 4 turned it on. So 4 must be a blicket and either 6 or 0 (or both) are also blickets? But then when we removed 0, the machine stayed on. So now we have 6 and 4. Then when we removed 6, the machine turned off. This suggests that 6 and 4 together are sufficient to keep the machine on? But note that when we removed 6, we were left with only 4. So if 4 alone were a blicket, the machine should have stayed on? But it turned off.\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\n- The machine turned on when we had 6, 0, and 4. But then we removed 0 and it stayed on, meaning that the presence of 0 was not necessary. Then we removed 6 and it turned off. So the machine turned off because we removed 6? Or because we removed 6 and now we have only 4?\n\nBut note that when we had 6 and 0 (without 4) the machine was off. Then when we added 4, it turned on. Then when we removed 0, we still had 6 and 4 and the machine was on. Then when we removed 6, we had only 4 and the machine turned off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine requires the presence of both 6 and 4? Because:\n\n- Without 4: machine off (initial state, and when only 6 and 0 were present).\n- With 4 and 6: machine on (after step 3 and step 4 when we had 6 and 4 and then 6 and 4 without 0).\n- Without 6: machine off (when we removed 6 and only 4 was left).\n\nBut what about object 0? It was present when the machine turned on initially, but when we removed it the machine stayed on. So object 0 is not required. Therefore, object 0 is not a blicket? Or it might be that the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if both 4 and 6 are present? Then what about object 0? It was on the machine at the time of activation but not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the possibility that the rule is \"the machine turns on if at least two blickets are on the machine\".

Then removing 6 left only 4 and the machine turned off.\n\nThis suggests that object 4 alone is not sufficient to turn the machine on? Because when we had only object 4 at the end, the machine turned off. But wait, when we added object 4 (to the existing 6 and 0) the machine turned on. And then when we removed 0 and 6, we were left with 4 and the machine turned off.\n\nHowever, note that the machine was on with objects 6 and 4 (after removing 0) and then turned off when 6 was removed. This implies that the presence of object 4 alone is not enough to keep the machine on? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine requires at least two blickets?

Also, when it was alone (with 0) the machine didn't turn on until 4 was added.

Then we put 4 and it turned on. Then we removed 0 and the machine stayed on. So object 0 might not be a blicket? Because when we removed it, the machine remained on. Also, the machine did not turn on when we had only 0 and 6.\n\n- Object 4: when we put it, the machine turned on. And when we removed 0 and 6, leaving only 4, the machine turned off.

Then removing object 0 (leaving {6,4}) the machine stayed on. Then removing object 6 (leaving only {4}) the machine turned off.\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\n- The machine turns on only when certain conditions are met. It seems that having object 4 alone is not enough to turn the machine on (since at the end, only 4 is on and the machine is off). However, note that when we added object 4 to the existing set (which had objects 6 and 0), the machine turned on. So perhaps object 4 is a blicket, but it requires at least one other blicket? Or maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, we might think about the rule:\n\nLet me denote the state of the machine after each action:\n\n1. After putting 6: off -> off. So 6 alone is not enough.\n2. After putting 0 (with 6): off -> off. So {0,6} together are not enough.\n3. After putting 4 (with 0 and 6): off -> on. So {0,6,4} causes the machine to turn on.\n\nThen:\n\n4. Remove 0: leaving {6,4} -> machine remains on. So {6,4} is sufficient to keep the machine on.\n\n5. Remove 6: leaving {4} -> machine turns off. So {4} alone is not sufficient.\n\nThis suggests that object 4 is necessary for the machine to be on in the state {6,4}? But note that when we had {0,6} (without 4) the machine was off, and adding 4 turned it on. Also, when we remove 6 from {6,4}, leaving only 4, the machine turns off.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that object 4 is a blicket? But note that object 6 might also be a blicket? Because:\n\n- Without object 4, {0,6} didn't turn the machine on. But when we added 4, it turned on. Then when we had {6,4} the machine stayed on, and when we removed 6 (leaving 4) it turned off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on?

Then when we added 4, it turned on.\n\nBut then why did it turn off when we removed 6? Because then we only had 4. So if 4 is a blicket, then having just one blicket (4) should turn the machine on?

Or a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if both object 4 and at least one other object are on the machine.\n\nLet me formalize:\n\n- If 4 is on the machine and at least one other object is also on, then the machine is on.\n- Otherwise, it is off.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- Step 1: only 6 -> off (because 4 is not present) -> but wait, we put 6 then 0 then 4.

But earlier when we had objects 6, 0, and 4, the machine was on. Then after removing 0, we had 6 and 4 and the machine was on. Then removing 6 (so only 4) turned the machine off.\n\nThis suggests that having only object 4 on the machine is not enough to turn it on. Therefore, object 4 by itself is not sufficient.\n\nLet's reexamine:\n\n- Step 4: After putting 4 on (with 6 and 0 already on), the machine turns on.\n\n- Step 5: Removing 0 (so now 6 and 4) -> machine remains on.\n\n- Step 6: Removing 6 (so now only 4) -> machine turns off.\n\nSo the machine turned off when we removed 6, meaning that when we had 6 and 4, the machine was on, but when we had only 4, it turned off. Therefore, having both 6 and 4 is sufficient to turn the machine on? But note that initially when we had 6 and 0 (without 4) the machine was off. Then adding 4 turned it on.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the machine requires at least one blicket and also that object 6 might be a blicket that is necessary when combined with 4? Or perhaps the rule is that both 4 and 6 are blickets and they are both required?\n\nLet me try to form a hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis 1: The machine turns on if and only if both object 4 and object 6 are on the machine.\n\nLet's test with the history:\n\n- Step 2: put 6 -> machine off (only 6, missing 4) -> matches.\n- Step 3: put 0 -> now 6 and 0 -> machine off (still missing 4) -> matches.\n- Step 4: put 4 -> now 6, 0, and 4 -> machine on (because 4 and 6 are both present) -> matches.\n- Step 5: remove 0 -> now 6 and 4 -> machine on -> matches.\n- Step 6: remove 6 -> now only 4 -> machine off -> matches.\n\nThis hypothesis fits perfectly.\n\nBut what about object 0? It was on the machine at some point but didn't cause the machine to turn on until 4 was added. Also, removing it didn't turn the machine off. So object 0 is not a blicket? And the rule is that both 4 and 6 are required.\n\nNow, the question: is object 6 a blicket?\n\nIn the context of this game, a blicket is an object that can make the machine turn on (under the right conditions).

Then when we removed object 6 (leaving only 4), the machine turned off.\n\nThis indicates that when only object 4 is on the machine, the machine is off.

Then after removing object 0 (leaving 6 and 4) the machine stayed on. Then when removing 6 (leaving 4) the machine turned off.\n\nSo the machine turned on only when at least two objects were present? Not exactly, because initially with 6 and 0 (two objects) the machine was off.\n\nLet me break down the states:\n\nState A: objects on machine = {6, 0} -> machine off.\nState B: objects on machine = {6, 0, 4} -> machine on.\nState C: objects on machine = {6, 4} -> machine on (after removing 0).\nState D: objects on machine = {4} -> machine off (after removing 6).\n\nFrom State A to State B: adding 4 turns the machine on. This suggests that 4 is a blicket and that the rule might require the presence of a blicket. However, note that in State A (with 6 and 0) the machine was off. So if 4 is a blicket, then why didn't the machine turn on with 6 and 0? Maybe 6 and 0 are not blickets? Or the rule is more complex.\n\nAlso, in State C (6 and 4) the machine is on. Then in State D (only 4) the machine is off. So the machine requires at least two objects? But in State A (6 and 0) the machine was off. Therefore, the rule cannot be simply having two or more objects.\n\nAlternative: the machine turns on if and only if there is at least one blicket on the machine? But then in State D (only 4) the machine is off, which would imply that 4 is not a blicket? But wait, in State B and C the machine was on and 4 was present. So if 4 were a blicket, then having 4 alone should turn the machine on? But it doesn't. So that rules out the simple rule of \"one blicket\".\n\nWhat if the rule is that the machine turns on when a specific combination of objects is present? But we don't have enough data for that.\n\nAnother idea: the rule might be that the machine turns on only when both object 4 and at least one other object are on the machine? Let's check:\n\n- In State B: {6,0,4} -> on (has 4 and others) -> fits.\n- In State C: {6,4} -> on (has 4 and 6) -> fits.\n- In State D: {4} -> off (only 4) -> fits.\n\nBut what about State A: {6,0} -> off. This also fits because 4 is not present.\n\nSo this rule would require the presence of object 4 and at least one other object. Then object 4 is a blicket? And the other objects (like 6 and 0) might not be blickets? But note that when we had {6,0} without 4, the machine was off, which is consistent.\n\nBut what about object 0? We don't have any evidence that it is a blicket.
