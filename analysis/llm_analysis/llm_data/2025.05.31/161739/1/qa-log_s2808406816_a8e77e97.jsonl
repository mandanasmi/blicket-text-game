But then when we have 6 alone, it doesn't work. Or maybe both are required? But then when we remove 1, it turns off.\n\nBut then when we add 4,2,5,0 and so on, we see:\n\nWe have a set that includes 5 and 0? But note that when we had {6,4,2,5} the machine turned on. Then when we added 0, it stayed on. Then we removed 5 and it turned off. Then we added 3 and 7 and it stayed off.\n\nSo what makes the machine turn on?\n\nWe have two positive examples:\n\n1. {1,6} -> on\n2. {6,4,2,5} -> on\n\nAnd when we remove 5 from the second set (leaving {6,4,2,0}) it turns off. Also, when we remove 1 from the first set (leaving {6}) it turns off.\n\nSo what do these sets have in common?\n\nWe must figure out the blickets. Notice that in the first set, when we remove 1, the machine turns off. So 1 is a blicket? Similarly, when we remove 5 from the second set, the machine turns off, so 5 is a blicket.\n\nBut what about object 6? In the first set, if we remove 1, leaving 6, the machine turns off. So 6 alone is not enough. In the second set, we have 6 and then we add 4,2,5 and it turns on. So 6 might not be a blicket? Or maybe it is but requires another?\n\nLet's try to think of the rule. One possibility is that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on the machine. But then:\n\n- Initially, with 1 and 6: if 1 is a blicket, then it should turn on. Then when we remove 1, if 6 is not a blicket, it turns off. That fits.\n\n- Then when we have 6 alone (not a blicket) and we add 4,2 (which we don't know) and then 5: when we add 5, it turns on. So 5 must be a blicket.\n\n- Then when we add 0, it stays on. So if 0 is a blicket, then that's consistent?

So either object 1 was the only blicket on the machine at that time, or the removal of object 1 caused the machine to turn off because it was a necessary part of the rule.\n\n However, note that initially both object 1 and object 6 were on the machine and the machine was on. After removing object 1, the machine turned off. This implies that object 6 alone (still on the machine) was not enough to keep the machine on. Therefore, object 6 might not be a blicket? Or the rule might require more than one blicket? But wait, let's see.\n\n But note: the initial state had two objects (1 and 6) and the machine was on. Removing object 1 caused the machine to turn off. So one possibility is that object 1 is a blicket and object 6 is not. Alternatively, the rule might require both? But then when we remove one, the machine turns off. However, we have to consider that the rule might be that the machine turns on if there is at least one blicket? Then why did the machine turn off when only object 6 was left? That would imply that object 6 is not a blicket and object 1 is.\n\n Let's continue with the actions:\n\n After removing object 1, the machine is off.\n\n Action 2: put object 4 on the machine -> machine off.\n   Now the machine has object 6 and object 4.

Therefore, object 5 is a blicket? Because the machine turned on when we added it? But note, it could be that the combination of objects 5 and some other object (like 6) is required? However, note that we had 6,4,2 and it was off, then adding 5 turned it on. So 5 must be a blicket? Or maybe 5 and 2 together? We have to be cautious.\n\n Action 5: put object 0 on the machine -> machine remains on (now on).\n   Adding object 0 didn't change the state (it was already on). So object 0 might be a blicket? Or not? We don't know.\n\n Action 6: take object 5 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n   Removing object 5 caused the machine to turn off. This suggests that object 5 was necessary for the machine to be on at that time. The other objects on the machine were 6,4,2,0. So without object 5, the machine turned off. Therefore, object 5 is a blicket and none of the others (6,4,2,0) are blickets? Because if any of them were, then the machine would have stayed on? But wait, what if the rule requires two blickets? Then we would need at least two. However, note that when we had objects 6,4,2,5 and 0, the machine was on. Then we removed 5 and it turned off. This suggests that among the objects that were on the machine at that time (6,4,2,0) none of them are blickets? Because if one of them was a blicket, then the machine should have stayed on? Unless the rule requires two blickets? But then we had 5 and 0? Or 5 and what? Let's see:\n\n   After removing 5, we have 6,4,2,0. If any of these were a blicket, then the machine should have stayed on? But it turned off. So if the rule is at least one blicket, then none of 6,4,2,0 are blickets.

So 1 and 6 are blickets? But then why did adding 5 turn the light on when we had {6,4,2,5}? Because 4 and 2 were added and they might not be blickets, but the rule might be that the machine turns on only when at least two blickets are on it?

Put object 7 on -> light remains off.\n     Now machine has objects 6,4,2,0,3,7 -> light off.\n\n Important: The machine turns on only when a specific condition is met. We must deduce the rule.\n\n Let's think about when the machine turned on and off:\n\n - Initially: objects 1 and 6 on machine -> light on.\n   Then removing 1 -> light off. So one of them (or both) is necessary.\n\n - After putting 4,2,5: when we put 5, the light turned on. So what changed? We added 5 to the set {6,4,2}.\n   So the set {6,4,2,5} turns the light on.\n\n - Then adding 0 (to make {6,4,2,5,0}) kept the light on.\n\n - Removing 5 (leaving {6,4,2,0}) turned the light off.\n\n - Then adding 3 (to make {6,4,2,0,3}) and then 7 (to make {6,4,2,0,3,7}) did not turn the light on.\n\n What is the rule?\n\n Let's consider the possibility that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is present? \n But note: when we had only 6,4,2 (after step 3) the light was off. Then adding 5 turned it on. So 5 might be a blicket? \n Also, when we had 6,4,2,5 and 0 (step 5) the light stayed on. Then removing 5 (step 6) turned it off, even though 0 was still there. \n So 0 might not be a blicket? Or the rule might require a specific set.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the machine requires the presence of a particular blicket? \n\n Let's list the objects that were on the machine when the light turned on:\n\n - Initially: 1 and 6 -> on. Then removing 1 -> off. So either 1 is a blicket and 6 is not, or both are.\n\n - Then after step 4: adding 5 to {6,4,2} turned it on.

We note that object 5 was critical because when it was added, the machine turned on, and when removed (with others still present) it turned off.\n\n Also, initially with 1 and 6 the machine was on. But after removing 1, it went off. So 1 might be critical? But then later we see without 1 and with 5 and 6 we get on.\n\n How about we list the state of the machine when it turns on and off:\n\n State 1: [1, 6] -> on\n State 2: [6] -> off (after removing 1)\n State 3: [6,4] -> off\n State 4: [6,4,2] -> off\n State 5: [6,4,2,5] -> on\n State 6: [6,4,2,5,0] -> on\n State 7: [6,4,2,0] -> off (after removing 5)\n State 8: [6,4,2,0,3] -> off\n State 9: [6,4,2,0,3,7] -> off\n\n Now, note that in state 5 the machine turned on when we added 5 to the set {6,4,2}. This suggests that 5 is a blicket and that the machine requires at least one blicket? But wait, initially we had 1 and 6 and it was on. So 1 and 6 might be blickets? Then why when we removed 1 (leaving 6) it turned off? That would imply that 6 is not a blicket? But then in state 5 we have 6,4,2,5 and it turned on.

And when we removed 1, we were left with 6 (which is not a blicket) so it turned off.\n\n Then in state 5, we added 5 (a blicket) to the non-blickets 6,4,2 and it turned on.

So 0 might not be a blicket? Or the rule is more complex.\n\nLet's try to deduce the rule:\n\nPossibilities:\n1. The machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on it? But then why did the machine turn on when we put 5? And then turn off when we removed 5? But initially with 1 and 6 it was on. Then when we removed 1, it turned off. So if object 1 is a blicket, then without it (only 6) the machine turned off. Then we added 4 and 2 and the machine remained off. Then we added 5 and it turned on.

It seems that object 5 is a blicket because when we added it (step 4), the machine turned on. Also, when we removed it (step 6), the machine turned off. However, note that in the initial state, the machine was on with objects 1 and 6. Then when we removed 1, it turned off. So object 1 might be a blicket as well.\n\nBut let's see if we can find a pattern:\n\nWe have two times the machine turned on:\n1. Initially: with objects 1 and 6 -> on.\n2. After adding 5 to the set {6,4,2} -> on.\n\nBut note: when we had {6,4,2} and added 5, it turned on. Then when we added 0, it stayed on. Then removing 5 made it turn off. So in the set {6,4,2,5,0}, removing 5 caused the machine to turn off. This suggests that 5 is a necessary blicket in that configuration.\n\nBut what about the initial configuration? With only 1 and 6, the machine was on. Then removing 1 (so leaving 6) turned it off. So 1 is also a blicket? But note that 6 was present in both the initial and the later configuration (with 4,2,5) when the machine turned on.
