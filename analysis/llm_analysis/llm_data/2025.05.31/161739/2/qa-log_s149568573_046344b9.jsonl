At this point, the only object left on the machine is object 5.\n\nNow, let's think about the rule:\n\n- The machine turned on when object 5 was placed (with the others already on). But note that when we had objects 1,3,2,7,4 on the machine (without 5), the machine was off. Then adding 5 made it on. So object 5 must be a blicket.\n\n- After that, we removed several objects (3,2,4,1) and the machine stayed on. Then when we removed object 7, the machine turned off. This suggests that object 7 is also a blicket? But wait: when we removed 7, the only object left was 5. And the machine turned off? That would imply that object 5 alone was not enough to keep the machine on? But when we added 5 initially, the machine turned on even though there were other objects (including 7) on the machine.\n\nLet's reexamine:\n\n- When we added 5 to the set {1,3,2,7,4}, the machine turned on. So the set {1,3,2,7,4,5} is sufficient.\n\n- Then we removed 3,2,4,1 and the machine stayed on. So now we have {7,5} on the machine and the machine is on.\n\n- Then we removed 7, leaving only 5, and the machine turned off.\n\nThis suggests that having only object 5 is not enough? But when we had {1,3,2,7,4,5} the machine was on. Then after removing 3,2,4,1 we had {7,5} and the machine was on. So why did removing 7 (leaving 5) turn the machine off?\n\nThis implies that both 5 and 7 are blickets and that the rule might require at least two blickets? Or perhaps a specific combination.\n\nAlternatively, note that when the machine turned on after adding 5, it was in the presence of 7. But then when we remove 7, the machine turns off even though 5 is still there. This suggests that the machine requires the presence of both 5 and 7? Or more generally, that the machine requires two specific blickets.\n\nBut let's see if we can find a simpler rule.\n\nAnother possibility: the machine turns on if and only if there is at least one blicket on the machine? But that doesn't fit because:\n\n- Initially, we put 1,3,2,7,4 and the machine didn't turn on. Then we put 5 and it did. So 5 is a blicket and the others are not? Then when we remove 5? But we never removed 5. We only removed 3,2,4,1,7. And when we removed 7 (the last non-blicket?) we left only 5. But then the machine turned off? That doesn't make sense if 5 is a blicket and the rule is \"at least one blicket\".\n\nWait, note the sequence of removal:\n\n- We never removed 5. We only removed 3,2,4,1,7. And then when we removed 7, the machine turned off. So at that point, the machine had only object 5. If 5 is a blicket, why did the machine turn off?\n\nUnless the rule is more complex.

That is odd because when we put object 5 (step 6) and it turned on, there were other objects. But now when only 5 is left, the machine is off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine being on does not depend solely on object 5. Let's reconsider.\n\nWhen we put object 5 and the machine turned on, there were objects 1,3,2,7,4 already on the machine. So the turning on event happened when we added 5 to the set {1,3,2,7,4}. Then when we remove everything except 5, the machine turns off. This indicates that the machine requires at least one blicket to be on, but also note that when we removed object 7 and left only 5, it turned off. So object 5 alone does not keep the machine on? But when we added 5 to the existing set, it turned on. So maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when a specific set of blickets is present?\n\nAlternatively, note that when we removed object 7, the machine turned off. This suggests that object 7 might be a blicket? But when we put object 7 (step 4) along with 1,3,2 and then 4, the machine didn't turn on until we put 5. So object 7 alone or with others (without 5) didn't turn the machine on.\n\nWait, let's think about what we know:\n\n- The machine turned on only when object 5 was placed (step 6). This suggests that object 5 is a blicket and that the rule might be that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on the machine? But then why did the machine stay on when we removed all the others until we removed object 7? And then when only 5 was left, it turned off? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be more complex. Let's look at the removals:\n\nAfter step 6: machine on with objects {1,2,3,4,5,7}. Then we remove 3,2,4,1 and the machine stays on until we remove 7. So the machine turned off when we removed 7 and left only 5. This suggests that the machine requires both object 5 and object 7 to be on?

Let's check:\n\nAfter putting all: [1,3,2,7,4,5] -> machine on.\n\nThen we removed 3 -> objects left: [1,2,7,4,5] -> machine on.\nRemoved 2 -> [1,7,4,5] -> machine on.\nRemoved 4 -> [1,7,5] -> machine on.\nRemoved 1 -> [7,5] -> machine on.\nRemoved 7 -> [5] -> machine off.\n\nWait, when we removed 7, the machine turned off. But then the only object left was 5? So why did it turn off? This suggests that having only object 5 on the machine is not sufficient to keep the machine on? But when we added object 5 (with the others) the machine turned on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the machine is on only when at least two blickets are present? Or maybe object 5 alone is not a blicket? But that seems inconsistent because when we added object 5 (to the existing set) the machine turned on.\n\nLet's look at the turning on event:\n\nWe added object 5 to the set {1,3,2,7,4} and the machine turned on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket and that the set without 5 was insufficient (so none of the others individually or in that combination were sufficient until 5 was added).\n\nThen, when we removed objects 3,2,4,1, the machine stayed on. But when we removed 7, the machine turned off. This suggests that object 7 is also a blicket? Because when we had both 5 and 7, the machine was on, and then removing 7 left only 5 and the machine turned off.\n\nAlternatively, it could be that the rule requires a specific combination.\n\nBut note: when we had [1,3,2,7,4,5] and then we removed 3,2,4,1, we were left with [7,5] and the machine was on. Then removing 7 left [5] and the machine turned off.\n\nThis implies that having both 5 and 7 is sufficient to turn the machine on? But when we added 5 to the set that included 7 (and others) the machine turned on. However, we don't know if having only 5 and 7 would be sufficient because we never had that configuration without the others? Actually, we did: after removing 1,3,2,4 we had [5,7] and the machine was on. So that configuration is sufficient.\n\nBut what about the initial turning on? When we added 5 to the set that included 7, the machine turned on. So we can infer that 5 is a blicket and 7 is a blicket? And that together they are sufficient? But what about the others? We removed 3,2,4,1 and the machine stayed on, so they are not necessary? So they might not be blickets? Or they might be but not required in the presence of 5 and 7?\n\nNow, what about object 3?

Then, after removing all others except 5, the machine turned off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine turning on is not solely due to object 5. It must be that a combination of objects is required.\n\nLet's think about when the machine turned on and off:\n\n- It turned on when object 5 was added to the set {1,3,2,7,4}. So the set {1,2,3,4,5,7} is on and the machine is on.\n- Then, we remove 3,2,4,1,7 one by one and the machine stays on until we remove 7? Wait, after removing 7 the machine turned off. But note that at the time of removing 7, the only object left was 5. So the machine turned off when we removed 7, but that left only 5. So why did it turn off?\n\nAlternatively, it could be that the machine is on if and only if at least one blicket is on the machine? But then when we added 5 (which we suspect is a blicket) the machine turned on. And when we removed all others and then 7, leaving only 5, the machine was still on until we removed 7? That doesn't fit because when we removed 7, the machine turned off but 5 was still on. Unless 5 is not a blicket and 7 is the one that was keeping it on? But then why did it turn on when we added 5?\n\nLet's reexamine the sequence:\n\nWhen we added object 5 (step 6), the machine turned on. At that point, the objects on the machine were 1,2,3,4,5,7. Then we removed 3 -> machine on (objects: 1,2,4,5,7). Then removed 2 -> machine on (1,4,5,7). Then removed 4 -> machine on (1,5,7). Then removed 1 -> machine on (5,7). Then removed 7 -> machine off (only 5 left).\n\nThis indicates that the machine is on only when both 5 and 7 are present? Or perhaps when a set of blickets that includes at least 5 and 7 is present? But note that when we had 5 and 7 (and others) the machine was on, and when we removed 7 (leaving only 5) it turned off.\n\nSo it seems that having object 5 alone is not enough to turn the machine on. Similarly, having 7 alone might not be enough (because when we put 7 earlier without 5, the machine was off). Also, having 1,2,3,4 without 5 and 7 did not turn the machine on.\n\nThus, the machine turned on only when both 5 and 7 were present? But note that when we put 5, we already had 1,2,3,4,7 on the machine. So the activation happened when 5 was added to a set that included 7.\n\nAlternatively, it could be that 5 and 7 are blickets and both must be present? Because after we removed 7, leaving only 5, the machine turned off. And when we had 5 and 7 together (even without others) the machine was on?

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object that has a non-zero mutual information with the machine state. That is, its presence or absence affects the machine.\n\nLet's break down the interactions step by step:\n\n1. Initially, all objects are on the floor, and the machine is off.\n\n2. The agent puts object 1 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n3. Then puts object 3 on -> still off.\n4. Then puts object 2 on -> still off.\n5. Then puts object 7 on -> still off.\n6. Then puts object 4 on -> still off.\n7. Then puts object 5 on -> machine turns ON.\n\nAt this point, the objects on the machine are: 1, 3, 2, 7, 4, 5.\n\nThe machine turned on only when object 5 was added. This suggests that object 5 is necessary for the machine to turn on? But note that the machine turned on when 5 was added to the existing set. However, we must also consider that the machine might require a specific combination.\n\nNow, the agent starts removing objects:\n\n8. Remove object 3 -> machine remains ON.\n9. Remove object 2 -> machine remains ON.\n10. Remove object 4 -> machine remains ON.\n11. Remove object 1 -> machine remains ON.\n12. Remove object 7 -> machine turns OFF.\n\nAfter removing object 7, the machine turns off. At that point, the only object left on the machine is object 5 (since we added 1,3,2,7,4,5 and then removed 3,2,4,1,7).\n\nSo, when only object 5 is on the machine, the machine turns off? That contradicts because when we had 1,3,2,7,4,5 the machine was on, and then after removing all except 5, it turned off.\n\nWait, let's track:\n\nAfter step 7: objects on machine: [1,3,2,7,4,5] -> machine ON.\n\nStep 8: remove 3 -> machine ON (objects: [1,2,7,4,5])\nStep 9: remove 2 -> machine ON (objects: [1,7,4,5])\nStep 10: remove 4 -> machine ON (objects: [1,7,5])\nStep 11: remove 1 -> machine ON (objects: [7,5])\nStep 12: remove 7 -> machine OFF (only object 5 remains)\n\nSo when we remove object 7, leaving only object 5, the machine turns off.\n\nThis tells us that having only object 5 is not enough to turn the machine on. Also, having only object 7 and 5 was enough to keep the machine on? Because after step 11, we had [7,5] and the machine was on. Then removing 7 left only 5 and the machine turned off.\n\nTherefore, the machine turned on when we added object 5 to the set that included objects 1,3,2,7,4.

Then we removed 3,2,4,1 and the machine stayed on until we removed 7. So the presence of both 5 and 7 seems to be important?

But that doesn't fit because when we had objects 1,3,2,7,4 without 5, the machine was off. Then we added 5 and it turned on. Then we removed 7 and it turned off (leaving 5).

In other words, the object's presence or absence affects whether the machine turns on.\n\nLet's analyze the interactions step by step:\n\n1. Initially, all objects are on the floor, and the machine is off.\n\n2. The agent puts object 1 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n3. Then object 3 is added -> machine remains off.\n4. Then object 2 is added -> machine remains off.\n5. Then object 7 is added -> machine remains off.\n6. Then object 4 is added -> machine remains off.\n7. Then object 5 is added -> machine turns on.\n\nSo after putting objects 1, 3, 2, 7, 4, and then 5, the machine turns on. This suggests that the activation of the machine requires a specific set of objects. Since the machine turned on when object 5 was added, it might be that object 5 is necessary, but note that we don't know if the other objects are also required.\n\nNow, the agent starts removing objects:\n\n8. Take object 3 off -> machine remains on.\n9. Take object 2 off -> machine remains on.\n10. Take object 4 off -> machine remains on.\n11. Take object 1 off -> machine remains on.\n12. Take object 7 off -> machine turns off.\n\nSo when object 7 was removed (the last step), the machine turned off. This suggests that object 7 is critical for the machine being on at that point.\n\nBut note: when the machine turned on initially, it was after adding object 5 to the set that included objects 1, 3, 2, 7, and 4. Then, after removing several objects (3,2,4,1) the machine stayed on until object 7 was removed.\n\nThis implies that the machine was on with only objects 5 and 7 on the machine? Let's see:\n\nAfter step 7: objects on the machine are 1, 3, 2, 7, 4, 5 -> machine on.\n\nThen after step 8: removing 3 -> objects: 1,2,7,4,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 9: removing 2 -> objects: 1,7,4,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 10: removing 4 -> objects: 1,7,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 11: removing 1 -> objects: 7,5 -> machine on.\nAfter step 12: removing 7 -> objects: 5 -> machine off.\n\nSo when only objects 5 and 7 were on the machine (after step 11), the machine was on. Then when object 7 was removed, leaving only object 5, the machine turned off.\n\nTherefore, the machine turns on only when both object 5 and object 7 are on the machine? But note that when we added object 5 (step 7) the machine turned on, but at that time there were other objects (1,3,2,7,4) as well. However, after removing all except 5 and 7, the machine remained on. Then when we remove 7, leaving 5, the machine turns off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine requires at least object 5 and object 7 to be on. However, we must check if there is another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, note that when we added object 5 and the machine turned on, the set included object 7 (which was already on the machine). Then when we removed all other objects except 5 and 7, the machine stayed on. Then removing 7 turned it off.\n\nBut what about the other objects? The machine did not turn on until object 5 was added. Also, removing objects 1, 2, 3, and 4 did not turn off the machine. So they are not necessary? However, we cannot rule out that they might have been part of a larger rule.\n\nBut note that after step 11, only objects 5 and 7 are on the machine and the machine is on. Then when we remove object 7, the machine turns off. This shows that object 7 is necessary for the machine to remain on in that specific context (with object 5). Therefore, object 7 is a blicket because its removal caused the machine to turn off (i.e., it has an effect on the machine).\n\nBut let's check the definition: a blicket is an object that is not independent of the machine. We have observed that when object 7 is removed (and the only other object on the machine is object 5), the machine turns off.
