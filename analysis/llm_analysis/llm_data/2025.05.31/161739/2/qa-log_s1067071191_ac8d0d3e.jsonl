Then we removed 2 (leaving 6) and the light turned off.\n\nSo we can conclude:\n- Object 2 is a blicket because when it was alone on the machine, the light was on.\n- Object 6 is not a blicket because when it was alone (initially and after removing 2) the light was off.\n\nNow, the next actions:\n\nAction 5: put object 7 on the machine (with 6 already on?

The rule could be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\n\nWe have established:\n- Object 2 is a blicket (from the first part).\n- Object 5 is a blicket (from the last action).\n\nNow, what about the others?\n\nIn the second part, we put objects 7,3,1,4,0 on the machine one by one (with 6 already on) and the light remained off until we put 5.\n\nThis means that among the objects 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 (note 6 was already on) we added 7,3,1,4,0 and the light didn't turn on until we added 5.\n\nTherefore, objects 0,1,3,4,6,7 are not blickets?

Even without object 6, object 2 alone can turn the machine on.\n\nNow, what about the other objects?\n\n- In the last part, when the machine had objects 6,7,3,1,4,0 and then 5 was added, the machine turned on. This suggests that object 5 might also be a blicket? But note that without object 5, the machine was off with all those objects (including 6). So adding object 5 made it turn on.\n\nBut we are concerned with object 2.\n\nWe have direct evidence that object 2 alone can turn the machine on (step 2). Therefore, object 2 is a blicket.\n\nHowever, let's also consider the rule. The rule might be that the machine turns on only if at least one blicket is on it. But we have:\n\n- When only 2 is on: machine on -> so 2 is a blicket.\n- When only 6 is on: machine off -> so 6 is not a blicket.\n\nBut wait, in step 1: when 2 and 6 were on, it was on.

Then putting object6 back (so both again) and then removing object2 left object6 and the light turned off.\n\n   So object2 is critical. What about object6? It was on the machine initially and the light was off. Then when we added object2, the light turned on. Then removing object6 didn't turn off the light? But then when we put object6 back and then removed object2, the light turned off. So object6 alone doesn't turn the light on.\n\n   However, note that in step 2: after removing object6, the machine had only object2 and the light was on. Then in step 3 we put object6 back and the light remained on. Then in step 4 we removed object2 and the light turned off. So object6 by itself does not turn the light on.\n\n   Therefore, object2 is a blicket and object6 is not.\n\n5. Action: put object7 on the machine.\n   Now: machine has object6 (which was already there) and object7? But wait, after step4 we took object2 off so only object6 was on and light was off. Then we put object7 on. The light remains off.\n\n   So adding object7 to object6 does not turn the light on.\n\n6. Then we put object3, then object1, then object4, then object0, one by one, and each time the light remains off.\n\n   So after step4, the machine has object6 and then we added:\n   - object7: light off\n   - object3: light off (now objects 6,7,3)\n   - object1: light off (now 6,7,3,1)\n   - object4: light off (now 6,7,3,1,4)\n   - object0: light off (now 6,7,3,1,4,0)\n   - and then object5: light turns on.\n\n   So when we added object5, the light turned on.\n\n   Therefore, object5 also seems to be a blicket.\n\nNow, let's summarize the states when the light was on:\n\n- When object2 was added (with object6 present) -> light on (and then without object6, with only object2 -> light on? Actually, after step2: we had only object2 and the light was on. So object2 alone is enough? But wait, in step4 we removed object2 and left object6 and the light turned off.

Let's analyze each step to understand the rule for the machine turning on and which objects are blickets.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: only object 6.\n- Machine light: off.\n\nStep 1: put object 2 on the machine.\n- Before: objects on machine: 6 (and now adding 2). After: objects 6 and 2 are on the machine.\n- Machine light turns on.\n\nStep 2: take object 6 off the machine.\n- Now only object 2 is on the machine.\n- Machine light remains on.\n\nStep 3: put object 6 on the machine.\n- Now objects 2 and 6 are on the machine again.\n- Machine light remains on.\n\nStep 4: take object 2 off the machine.\n- Now only object 6 is on the machine (back to initial state).\n- Machine light turns off.\n\nThis suggests that when only object 6 is on the machine, the light is off. But when object 2 is added (with 6 present) the light turns on. Also, when we remove 6 and leave only 2, the light remains on. Then when we remove 2 and leave only 6, the light goes off.\n\nSo from step 4, we see that with only object 6 on the machine, the light is off. But in step 1, when we added object 2 to object 6, the light turned on. And in step 2, when we removed 6 and left only 2, the light stayed on. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket and object 6 might not be (or at least not by itself).\n\nBut then step 3: putting object 6 back (so now 2 and 6) and the light is on. Then step 4: removing 2 and leaving 6, the light goes off. So object 6 alone does not turn the machine on, but object 2 alone does (as in step 2).\n\nSo far, we have:\n- Object 2 alone: machine on (from step 2: after removing 6 and leaving 2, the light is on).\n- Object 6 alone: machine off (from step 4).\n\nNow, step 5: put object 7 on the machine.\n- Currently, after step 4: object 6 is on the machine? No, step 4 ended with taking object 2 off, leaving object 6 on the machine? Let me check:\n\nAfter step 4: \"You took object 2 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\" and the machine only has object 6? But the light is off. So object 6 alone -> off.\n\nNow step 5: put object 7 on the machine. Now the machine has object 6 and object 7. The light remains off.\n\nStep 6: put object 3 on the machine. Now objects 6,7,3. Light off.\n\nStep 7: put object 1 on the machine. Now 6,7,3,1. Light off.\n\nStep 8: put object 4 on the machine. Now 6,7,3,1,4. Light off.\n\nStep 9: put object 0 on the machine. Now 6,7,3,1,4,0. Light off.\n\nStep 10: put object 5 on the machine. Now 6,7,3,1,4,0,5. Light turns on.\n\nWhat caused the light to turn on? It turned on when we added object 5. So it seems that object 5 is a blicket because when we added it, the machine turned on.\n\nBut note that the machine was off with objects 6,7,3,1,4,0. Then adding 5 turned it on. However, we must also consider that object 2 was a blicket (it turned the machine on by itself). Now, object 5 also turned the machine on when added to the set? But the set already had several objects.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it. But if that were the case, then when we had object 2 alone, it was on. Then when we added object 7 (with 6 already there) the machine should have turned on if 7 were a blicket? But it didn't. Similarly, when we added 3,1,4,0, the machine didn't turn on. Only when we added 5, it turned on.\n\nSo let's list the objects that we have seen turn the machine on:\n\n- Object 2: when added to the machine (with object 6 present) turned the machine from off to on.

We need to determine if object 7 is a blicket.\n A blicket is defined as an object whose state (on machine or not) is not independent of the machine's state (on or off). \n In other words, the object being on the machine should have some effect on whether the machine turns on.\n\n Let's analyze the interactions step by step:\n\n Initial state:\n   Objects on machine: object 6 (only)\n   Machine state: off (since the light is off at the start, and we see that after putting object 2 the light turns on, but initially we have object6 on machine and the light is off)\n\n However, note the initial description: \"object 6 is on top of the machine\" and \"the light on the machine is currently off\".\n\n Step 1: > put object 2 on the machine\n   Before: machine has object6 (and light is off). Then we add object2 -> machine turns on (light on).\n   So after: objects on machine: 6 and 2 -> machine on.\n\n Step 2: > take object 6 off the machine\n   We remove object6. Now machine has only object2 -> and the light remains on? \n   But the history says: \"You took object 6 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" \n   So with only object2, the machine is on.\n\n Step 3: > put object 6 on the machine\n   Now we put object6 back. Machine now has object2 and object6 -> light is on.\n\n Step 4: > take object 2 off the machine\n   Remove object2. Now machine has only object6 -> light turns off.\n   This is a critical point: when only object6 is on the machine, the light is off (as in the initial state). \n   But when we had object2 alone, the light was on (from step2). \n\n Step 5: > put object 7 on the machine\n   Now we put object7 on the machine. Machine has object6 and object7 -> light remains off.\n\n Step 6: > put object 3 on the machine\n   Now we add object3. Machine has objects 6,7,3 -> light remains off.\n\n Step 7: > put object 1 on the machine\n   Add object1. Machine has 6,7,3,1 -> light remains off.\n\n Step 8: > put object 4 on the machine\n   Add object4. Machine has 6,7,3,1,4 -> light remains off.\n\n Step 9: > put object 0 on the machine\n   Add object0. Machine has 6,7,3,1,4,0 -> light remains off.\n\n Step 10: > put object 5 on the machine\n   Add object5. Machine has 6,7,3,1,4,0,5 -> light turns on.\n\n We need to figure out the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\n Observations:\n - When only object2 is on the machine (step2), the machine is on.\n - When only object6 is on the machine (step4 and initially), the machine is off.\n - When we put object2 and object6 together (step1 and step3), the machine is on.\n - When we remove object2 and leave object6 (step4), the machine turns off.\n\n Then we added several objects (7,3,1,4,0) one by one and the machine remained off until we added object5.\n\n So the machine turned on when we added object5 to the existing set (which included objects 6,7,3,1,4,0). \n\n What does that tell us?\n\n Let's think about what causes the machine to turn on.\n\n Possibilities:\n  1. The machine turns on only if a specific blicket is present? But note that object2 alone made it on, and object5 made it on when added to a group that didn't have object2.\n\n  2. It might be that there are multiple blickets and the machine requires at least one blicket to be present? But then why did the machine turn off when we removed object2 and left object6? Because if object6 is not a blicket, then without any blicket the machine should be off. However, when we had only object2 (a blicket) it was on. Then when we added object6 (non-blicket) and object2 together, it stayed on. Then removing object2 (the only blicket) left only object6 (non-blicket) and the machine turned off.\n\n  3. But wait: when we put object5 and the machine turned on, that suggests that object5 is a blicket.
