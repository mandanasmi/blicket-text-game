That is, the object's presence or absence on the machine affects whether the machine turns on.\n\nLet's analyze the interactions step by step:\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: only object 4.\n- Objects on floor: 0,1,2,3,5,6,7.\n- Machine light: off.\n\nAction 1: put object 3 on the machine.\n- Now on machine: objects 4 and 3.\n- Machine light: off.\n\nAction 2: put object 1 on the machine.\n- Now on machine: objects 4, 3, and 1.\n- Machine light: turns on.\n\nThis suggests that with objects 4, 3, and 1 on the machine, the machine turns on.\n\nAction 3: take object 3 off the machine.\n- Now on machine: objects 4 and 1.\n- Machine light: off.\n\nSo, without object 3, the machine turns off.\n\nAction 4: put object 3 back on the machine.\n- Now on machine: objects 4, 1, and 3 again.\n- Machine light: turns on.\n\nThis confirms that having object 3 along with 4 and 1 turns the machine on.\n\nAction 5: take object 4 off the machine.\n- Now on machine: objects 1 and 3 (object 4 removed).\n- Machine light: remains on.\n\nThis is important. After removing object 4, the machine remains on with only objects 1 and 3.\n\nSo what do we know?\n\n- With objects 4 and 3 (and without object 1) the machine was off (from action 1: 4 and 3 -> off).\n- Then adding object 1 made it turn on (action 2: 4,3,1 -> on).\n- Removing object 3 made it turn off (action 3: 4,1 -> off).\n- Putting object 3 back made it turn on (action 4: 4,1,3 -> on).\n- Then removing object 4 (leaving 1 and 3) kept it on (action 5: 1,3 -> on).\n\nTherefore, we can deduce:\n\n- The machine turns on when both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine, regardless of object 4? Because when we had only 1 and 3, the machine stayed on.\n\nBut note that at the beginning, when only object 4 was on the machine (initial state) and then we added object 3 (so 4 and 3) the machine was off. Then when we added object 1 (to make 4,3,1) it turned on. Then removing 3 (leaving 4 and 1) turned it off. Then putting 3 back (4,3,1) turned it on. Then removing 4 (leaving 1 and 3) it stayed on.\n\nSo the rule might be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\nLet's test:\n\n- Initial: only 4 -> off (consistent because we don't have both 1 and 3).\n- After action1: 4 and 3 -> off (because 1 is missing).\n- After action2: 4,3,1 -> on (both 1 and 3 are present).\n- After action3: 4 and 1 -> off (3 is missing).\n- After action4: 4,3,1 -> on (both 1 and 3).\n- After action5: 1 and 3 -> on (both 1 and 3).\n\nSo the rule seems to be that the machine requires both object 1 and object 3 to be on the machine.\n\nWhat about object 4? In the initial state, object 4 was on the machine and the machine was off. Then when we had only 4 and 1 (without 3) it was off. And when we had 4,3,1 it was on. But then when we removed 4 and had only 1 and 3 it was still on. So object 4 is not necessary. Therefore, object 4 might not be a blicket? But note that we have to define a blicket as an object that is not independent of the machine. However, the rule we have does not require object 4. So the machine state does not depend on object 4? But note:\n\n- When we removed object 4 from the machine (action5) the machine stayed on. So removing object 4 did not change the state (it was on and stayed on).

The rule must involve which objects are blickets and their positions.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n\n- When only objects 4 and 3 are on the machine (after step 1), the machine is off.\n- Adding object 1 (step 2) turns the machine on. So, the presence of object 1 seems to cause the machine to turn on, but note that initially when object 4 was alone, the machine was off, and when 4 and 3 were together, it was off. So the activation must depend on the combination.\n\nStep 3: Removing object 3 (leaving 4 and 1) turns the machine off. So without object 3, the machine turns off even though object 1 and 4 are present? But note that in step 2, when we had 4,3,1 the machine was on. Then removing 3 (step 3) leaves 4 and 1, and the machine turns off. This suggests that having 4 and 1 without 3 is not sufficient? Or perhaps object 3 is necessary.\n\nStep 4: Putting object 3 back (so now 4,1,3 again) turns the machine on. This is consistent with step 2.\n\nStep 5: Removing object 4 (leaving 1 and 3) and the machine remains on. So without object 4, but with 1 and 3, the machine is still on.\n\nThis suggests that object 4 might not be necessary for the machine to be on? Because when we remove it, the machine stays on.\n\nLet's summarize the states:\n\nState A: [4] -> off (initial state, but note: at the beginning, object 4 was on the machine and the machine was off. Also, after step 1: [4,3] -> off)\n\nState B: [4,3,1] -> on (step 2)\n\nState C: [4,1] -> off (step 3)\n\nState D: [4,3,1] -> on (step 4, same as state B)\n\nState E: [1,3] -> on (step 5)\n\nFrom state E, we see that with only objects 1 and 3, the machine is on. This suggests that the set {1,3} is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\nBut note: in state A, [4,3] is off. So having 3 and 4 is not sufficient? Then how come in state B and D, adding 1 to [4,3] turns it on? And in state C, [4,1] is off? So it seems that both 1 and 3 must be present? Because:\n\n- [1,3] -> on (state E)\n- [4,3] -> off (state A and step1)\n- [4,1] -> off (state C)\n\nTherefore, the rule might be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\nBut what about object 4? In state E, we removed object 4 and the machine remained on. So object 4 is not necessary for the machine to be on. Also, in state B and D, the machine is on with 4,3,1, but that is because 1 and 3 are present? And when we remove 3 (state C) the machine goes off even though 1 and 4 are present? That fits.\n\nHowever, we must consider if there are other blickets.

When we have objects 4 and 3 on the machine (after action 1), the machine is off.\n2. Adding object 1 (action 2) turns the machine on. So the set {4,3,1} turns it on.\n3. Removing object 3 (action 3) leaves objects 4 and 1 on the machine, and the machine turns off. So {4,1} does not turn it on.\n4. Putting object 3 back (action 4) with 4 and 1 (so set {4,1,3}) turns it on again.\n5. Removing object 4 (action 5) leaves objects 1 and 3 on the machine, and the machine remains on.\n\nNow, note that in step 5, with objects 1 and 3 (without 4), the machine stays on.\n\nThis suggests that object 4 might not be necessary for the machine to be on, because after removing it, the machine remains on with just 1 and 3.\n\nBut let's check when the machine turned on:\n\n- First time it turned on: when we added object 1 to {4,3}. So the set {4,3,1} turns it on.\n- Then, when we had {4,1} (without 3), it was off. Then adding 3 turned it on again (so {4,1,3} works).\n- Then, when we remove 4 (leaving {1,3}), the machine remains on.\n\nThis implies that the set {1,3} is sufficient to turn the machine on? But note that initially we had only object 4 on the machine and it was off. Then when we added 3 (so {4,3}) it was still off. Then adding 1 turned it on.\n\nAlso, after removing 3 (leaving {4,1}), it turned off. Then putting 3 back turned it on. Then removing 4 (leaving {1,3}) and it stayed on.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine? But what about object 4?\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that both 1 and 3 must be present:\n\n- In the state {4,3} (after action 1): no 1 -> off (correct).\n- In state {4,3,1}: has 1 and 3 -> on (correct).\n- In state {4,1}: no 3 -> off (correct).\n- In state {4,1,3}: has 1 and 3 -> on (correct).\n- In state {1,3}: has 1 and 3 -> on (as observed).\n\nBut what about object 4? It was present in some on states and not in others. In the state {1,3} (without 4) the machine is on. So the rule doesn't require object 4.\n\nTherefore, the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\nNow, what about object 4? We have:\n\n- When only object 4 was on the machine (initially) and then we added 3 (so {4,3}), the machine was off. This is consistent because 1 was missing.\n- Also, when we had {4,1} without 3, the machine was off.\n\nSo object 4 does not seem to be required. Moreover, note that in the last step, when we remove object 4 from the set {4,1,3} (which is on) we are left with {1,3} and the machine remains on.

So without object 3, the machine turns off? But then we put object 3 back and it turns on again (step 4).\n\n However, note that when we remove object 4 (step 5) and leave objects 1 and 3, the light remains on.\n\n Let's summarize the states and the machine state:\n\n State 0 (initial): [4] -> off\nState 1: [4,3] -> off\nState 2: [4,3,1] -> on\nState 3: [4,1] -> off   (after removing 3)\nState 4: [4,1,3] -> on  (putting 3 back)\nState 5: [1,3] -> on    (removed 4)\n\n So what causes the machine to turn on?\n\n Notice that in state 2 and state 4, we have both object 1 and object 3 on the machine (and object 4 is also present in state2 and state4, but in state5 we remove object4 and the machine stays on with only 1 and 3). Therefore, the machine turns on when both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\n Let's check:\n\n - In state0: [4] -> off -> missing 1 and 3? Actually, only 4 is present -> off (correct)\n - In state1: [4,3] -> off -> missing object 1 -> off (correct)\n - In state2: [4,3,1] -> on -> has both 1 and 3 -> on (correct)\n - In state3: [4,1] -> off -> missing 3 -> off (correct)\n - In state4: [4,1,3] -> on -> has both 1 and 3 -> on (correct)\n - In state5: [1,3] -> on -> has both 1 and 3 -> on (correct)\n\n Therefore, the rule is: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\n Now, what about the other objects? In particular, what about object 4?\n\n In state0: object4 alone -> off -> so object4 alone doesn't cause the machine to turn on.\n In state5: without object4, the machine is on -> so object4 is not necessary.\n\n Also, note that in state1 we had objects 4 and 3 (without 1) -> off. Then we added 1 and it turned on. So object4 does not by itself cause the machine to turn on, and it is not required for the machine to be on (as seen in state5).\n\n Therefore, the blickets are the objects that are part of the rule.

In step 5 we have objects 1 and 3 and the machine is on.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine? But wait, what about object 4?\n\nIn step 5: we removed object 4 and the machine remained on. So object 4 is not necessary when both 1 and 3 are present.\n\nBut in step 3: we had objects 1 and 4 (without 3) and the machine was off. Then in step 5: we have objects 1 and 3 (without 4) and the machine is on.\n\nSo the rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one of the following is true:\n- Both object 1 and object 3 are present?\nBut also note that in step 1, we had 3 and 4 and it was off. In step 2, we added 1 and it turned on.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the rule as requiring object 1 and object 3 to be present? But in step 5, we have only 1 and 3 and it is on. And in step 4 we had 1,3,4 and it was on. In step 2 we had 1,3,4 and it was on. In step 3 we had 1 and 4 (without 3) and it was off. And in step 1 we had 3 and 4 (without 1) and it was off.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 3 are on the machine.\n\nWhat about object 4? It was initially on the machine and the machine was off. Then when we added 3, it was still off. Then when we added 1, it turned on. Then we removed 3 and it turned off. Then we put 3 back and it turned on. Then we removed 4 and it remained on.
