Take object 6 off -> machine turns off.\n    Now on machine: 0\n    Machine: off\n\n We need to figure out the rule for the machine turning on.\n\n Notice that when we added object 0 (step 4) the machine turned on. However, at that point there were many objects on the machine (4,7,3,6,1,0). Then we started removing objects and the machine stayed on until we removed object 6 (leaving only 0) and then it turned off.\n\n This suggests that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is on the machine? But note that when we had only object 0 at the end, the machine turned off. So that would imply that object 0 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n Let's look at the state when the machine turned on: it turned on when we added object 0 to the set {4,7,3,6,1}. Then we removed objects one by one until we had only 6 and 0, and the machine was on. Then when we removed 6 (leaving 0) it turned off.\n\n This suggests that the machine requires the presence of at least two blickets? Or maybe a specific pair?\n\n Alternatively, note that when we had objects 6 and 0 together, the machine was on. Then when we removed 6, leaving only 0, it turned off.\n\n So let's consider the possibility that both 0 and 6 are blickets and that the machine requires at least one blicket? But if that were the case, then when we had only 0 (after removing 6) the machine should have stayed on (if 0 is a blicket) but it turned off. So that would imply 0 is not a blicket? But then why did it turn on when we added 0? It must be that 0 alone is not sufficient, but in combination with 6 it is.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if at least one of the blickets is on the machine, but note that at the beginning we had 4 and 7 on the machine and the machine was off. So 4 and 7 are not blickets? But then when we added 0 and the machine turned on, it suggests 0 is a blicket. However, when we removed everything except 0, the machine turned off. This is a contradiction if the rule is that the machine is on when at least one blicket is on.\n\n Therefore, the rule must be more complex.\n\n Let's consider the sequence of events:\n\n - Initially: machine has 4 and 7 -> off. So 4 and 7 are not blickets (or at least their presence alone doesn't turn the machine on).\n\n - We added 3, then 6, then 1, then 0. After adding 0, the machine turned on. So what changed? We added 0. But note that when we later removed 3,4,7,1 and left 6 and 0, the machine stayed on until we removed 6.

Possible rules include:\n- At least one blicket must be on the machine? But initially 4 and 7 were on and the machine was off. Then we added non-blickets until we added 0 and it turned on. So maybe 4 and 7 are not blickets? But note that when we removed them later, the machine stayed on until we removed enough.\n\nAfter the machine turned on (with objects 4,7,3,6,1,0 on the machine), we have:\n\nAction 5: > take object 3 off the machine\n- Now on machine: 4,7,6,1,0\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 6: > take object 4 off the machine\n- Now on machine: 7,6,1,0\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 7: > take object 7 off the machine\n- Now on machine: 6,1,0\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 8: > take object 1 off the machine\n- Now on machine: 6,0\n- Machine remains on.\n\nAction 9: > take object 6 off the machine\n- Now on machine: 0\n- Machine turns off.\n\nSo when we remove object 6, leaving only object 0 on the machine, the machine turns off. But note that when we had objects 6 and 0 on the machine, the machine was on. Then we remove 6, leaving only 0, and it turns off.\n\nThis suggests that having only object 0 is not enough? Or perhaps object 0 is a blicket but requires another? Let's think about the turning on event:\n\nThe machine turned on when we added object 0 to the set {4,7,3,6,1}. Then we removed 3,4,7,1 and the machine stayed on until we removed 6 (leaving only 0).\n\nBut note that after removing 1, we had {6,0} on the machine and the machine was on. Then removing 6 (leaving only 0) turned it off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on?

But note that the existing set (without 0) had objects 4,7,3,6,1 and the machine was off. Then we added 0 and it turned on. So object 0 is likely a blicket.\n\nBut also, when we removed all other objects except 0, the machine turned off. That alone doesn't rule out 0 being a blicket because the rule might require more than one blicket.\n\nNow, what about the other objects? Let's see when the machine turned off: when we removed object 6 and left only 0. But note that when we had 6 and 0, the machine was on. So if 0 is a blicket, then 6 must also be a blicket? Because if 6 were not a blicket, then having only 0 (a blicket) should turn the machine on? But it didn't.

We need to determine if object 2 is a blicket.\n\n Recall: A blicket is an object that has a non-independent relationship with the machine (i.e., its presence or absence affects whether the machine turns on).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Note the initial state:\n    - Objects on machine: 4 and 7 -> machine is off.\n    - Objects on floor: 0,1,2,3,5,6.\n\n 2. The agent's actions and machine responses:\n\n    Action: put object 3 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n    Action: put object 6 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n    Action: put object 1 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n    Action: put object 0 on the machine -> machine turns on.\n\n    At this point, the objects on the machine are: 4, 7 (initially) and then 3,6,1,0.

At that point, the objects left on the machine are: 0 and whatever was not removed? Let's track:\n\n        Initially after adding 0: machine has 0,1,3,4,6,7 -> machine on.\n\n        Removing 3: now 0,1,4,6,7 -> on.\n        Removing 4: now 0,1,6,7 -> on.\n        Removing 7: now 0,1,6 -> on.\n        Removing 1: now 0,6 -> on.\n        Removing 6: now only 0 -> machine turns off.\n\n 3. We need to figure out the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\n    Notice that when the agent put object 0 on the machine (which was the 4th put action), the machine turned on. At that time, the machine had objects: 4,7 (already there) and then 3,6,1,0. So the set was {0,1,3,4,6,7}.\n\n    Then, after removing all except 0 and 6, the machine was still on. But when 6 was removed (leaving only 0), the machine turned off.\n\n    Also, note that when only 0 was left, the machine turned off. This suggests that having only object 0 is not enough to turn the machine on.\n\n    Let's think about the critical moments:\n\n        - When object 0 was added (to the existing set of 4,7,3,6,1) the machine turned on. But note that the set at that time included 0 and 1 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 7.\n\n        - Then, after removing several objects (3,4,7,1) the machine remained on until 6 was removed. So when the set was {0,6} the machine was on, but when it became {0} it turned off.\n\n    This suggests that the machine requires at least two objects to be on? But note that initially we had two objects (4 and 7) and the machine was off.\n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the machine turns on only when a specific combination is present.\n\n    Let's look at when the machine turned on: when object 0 was added. What changed? The set of objects on the machine became {0,1,3,4,6,7}. Then, after removing 3,4,7,1, we are left with {0,6} and the machine is still on. Then removing 6 leaves {0} and the machine turns off.\n\n    Also, note that when the machine was turned on with {0,1,3,4,6,7}, we cannot be sure which objects are blickets. But we can test by removal:\n\n        - Removing 3: machine stays on -> so object 3 is not necessary for the machine to stay on? Or it might be that the machine remains on as long as at least one blicket is present? But note that we have multiple blickets.\n\n    However, the definition of a blicket is that the object's state is not independent of the machine. So we have to see if object 2's presence or absence affects the machine.\n\n    But note: object 2 has never been touched. It has always been on the floor.

Or the rule might be more complex.\n\nNow, after turning the machine on, the agent starts removing objects:\n\n5. > take object 3 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: 4,7,6,1,0   (removed 3)\n   - Machine remains on.\n\n6. > take object 4 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: 7,6,1,0   (removed 4)\n   - Machine remains on.\n\n7. > take object 7 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: 6,1,0   (removed 7)\n   - Machine remains on.\n\n8. > take object 1 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: 6,0   (removed 1)\n   - Machine remains on.\n\n9. > take object 6 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: 0   (removed 6)\n   - Machine turns off.\n\nSo, when only object 0 is left, the machine turns off? But when we had 0 and 6 (and others) it was on, and when we remove 6 leaving only 0, it turns off.\n\nWait, let's reexamine:\n\nAfter step 4: machine on with objects [4,7,3,6,1,0] -> on.\n\nAfter step 5 (remove 3): [4,7,6,1,0] -> on.\nAfter step 6 (remove 4): [7,6,1,0] -> on.\nAfter step 7 (remove 7): [6,1,0] -> on.\nAfter step 8 (remove 1): [6,0] -> on.\nAfter step 9 (remove 6): [0] -> off.\n\nSo when we remove 6 and leave only 0, the machine turns off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine requires at least two blickets? Or a specific combination?\n\nLet's think about the blickets.\n\nWe know that when we added object 0 to the set [4,7,3,6,1] (which was off) the machine turned on. So the activation must have been caused by object 0. Therefore, object 0 is a blicket.\n\nBut note that after removal, when we have only 0 and 6 (and others) the machine is on, and then when we remove 6 and leave 0, it turns off. This implies that 6 might be a blicket? Or that we need more than one blicket?\n\nHowever, consider the initial state: objects 4 and 7 were on the machine and the machine was off. Then we added 3,6,1 and it remained off. Then we added 0 and it turned on. So 0 is a blicket.\n\nNow, when we remove 6 and leave only 0, the machine turns off. But if 0 is the only blicket, then having 0 alone should turn the machine on? But it doesn't. Therefore, the machine might require at least two blickets to be on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the machine requires a specific set of blickets?

Note that object 5 was never placed on the machine, so we have to infer from the rule and the behavior.\n\nKey observations:\n\n- Initially, with objects 4 and 7 on the machine, the light was off. Then adding 3,6,1 did not turn it on. Only when object 0 was added did the light turn on.\n\n- After turning on, we removed several objects one by one (3,4,7,1,6) and the light stayed on until we removed object 6 (leaving only object 0) and then it turned off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine turns on when a specific set of objects are present. Notice that when we had objects 4,7,3,6,1,0 the machine turned on. Then we removed 3,4,7,1 and the light stayed on until we removed 6 (leaving only 0). So when we had 6 and 0 together, the light was on? But when we removed 6 (leaving only 0) the light turned off.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the state when the light turned on: after adding 0 to the set {4,7,3,6,1}. Then when we remove 3,4,7,1, the light remains on until we remove 6. So the set that is critical might be a subset of {0,6}? Because when we had both 0 and 6 (and others) the light was on, and when we had only 0 (after removing 6) the light went off.\n\nBut note: when we had only 0 at the end, the light was off. Also, when we had 6 and 0 together (along with others) the light was on. And when we removed 6 (leaving only 0) the light turned off. So perhaps the rule is that the machine requires both 0 and 6 to be present? But wait, what about the other objects?\n\nLet's see the state when the light turned on: we had objects 0,1,3,4,6,7 on the machine. Then we removed 3 -> still on. Then removed 4 -> still on. Then removed 7 -> still on. Then removed 1 -> still on. Then removed 6 -> off. So the light was on until we removed 6, even when only 0 and 6 were left? But then when we removed 6, leaving 0, it turned off.\n\nHowever, note that when we removed 6, we were left with only 0. So if the rule required both 0 and 6, then when we remove 6, the condition fails and the machine turns off. That fits.\n\nBut what about the initial state? We had 4 and 7 on the machine and the light was off. Then we added 3, then 6, then 1, and the light remained off until we added 0. So adding 0 made the light turn on.

We need to determine if object 7 is a blicket.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object that has a non-independent relationship with the machine (i.e., its presence on the machine affects whether the machine turns on).\n\nWe have 8 objects. Initially:\n- Objects on the machine: 4 and 7 -> machine light is off.\n- Objects on the floor: 0,1,2,3,5,6.\n\nThe agent then performs a series of actions:\n\n1. Put object 3 on the machine -> light remains off.\n2. Put object 6 on the machine -> light remains off.\n3. Put object 1 on the machine -> light remains off.\n4. Put object 0 on the machine -> light turns ON.\n\nAt this point, the machine turns on. So the objects on the machine are: 4,7,3,6,1,0. But note that initially 4 and 7 were on, then 3,6,1 were added without turning on, and then adding 0 turned it on.\n\nSo the state that turned on the machine: objects 4,7,3,6,1,0 are on the machine.\n\nBut then the agent starts removing objects:\n\n5. Take object 3 off -> light remains on.\n6. Take object 4 off -> light remains on.\n7. Take object 7 off -> light remains on.\n8. Take object 1 off -> light remains on.\n9. Take object 6 off -> light turns OFF.\n\nAfter removing object 6, the machine turns off.\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\n- When we added objects one by one, the machine turned on only when object 0 was added. So what caused the machine to turn on?\n  - Before adding 0: objects on machine: 4,7,3,6,1 -> off.\n  - After adding 0: objects 4,7,3,6,1,0 -> on.\n\n- Then, after removing several objects, the machine turned off only when object 6 was removed. At the time of removing 6, the machine had objects: 0, and also note that we removed 3,4,7,1 and then 6. Let's track:\n\n  After step 4 (machine on): objects on machine: 0,1,3,4,6,7.\n\n  Step 5: remove 3 -> objects left: 0,1,4,6,7 -> machine still on.\n  Step 6: remove 4 -> objects left: 0,1,6,7 -> machine still on.\n  Step 7: remove 7 -> objects left: 0,1,6 -> machine still on.\n  Step 8: remove 1 -> objects left: 0,6 -> machine still on.\n  Step 9: remove 6 -> objects left: 0 -> machine turns off.\n\nSo when only object 0 is left, the machine is off.\n\nWe need to figure out the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nImportant observations:\n\n- The machine turned on when we added object 0 to the set {4,7,3,6,1}. So without object 0, the set {4,7,3,6,1} does not turn the machine on. With object 0, it does.\n\n- The machine turned off when we removed object 6 from the set {0,6}. So the set {0} does not turn the machine on, but {0,6} does.\n\nBut note: when we had {0,1,6,7} (after removing 4) the machine was on. Then we removed 7 -> {0,1,6} still on. Then removed 1 -> {0,6} still on. Then removed 6 -> {0} off.\n\nSo the machine is on when both 0 and 6 are present? Not necessarily, because earlier when we had {4,7,3,6,1} without 0, the machine was off. Then adding 0 turned it on. And when we had {0,6} it was on, but when we remove 6 it becomes off.\n\nHowever, note that in the initial state, we had objects 4 and 7 on the machine and the machine was off. Then we added 3,6,1 without turning on until we added 0.\n\nAlso, when we removed 3,4,7,1, the machine stayed on until we removed 6. So it seems that the machine requires at least object 0 and object 6 to be present? But wait, what about the other objects?\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the machine turns on only if both object 0 and object 6 are on the machine.
