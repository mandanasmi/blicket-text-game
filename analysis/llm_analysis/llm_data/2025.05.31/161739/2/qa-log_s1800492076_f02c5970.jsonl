So the set [1,2] is not enough to keep the machine on? But wait, note that when we had [1,2,5] the machine was on, and after removing 5 we have [1,2] and the machine turns off.\n\n12. > put object 5 on the machine\n    - Now on machine: [1,2,5]\n    - Machine: turns on\n\n    This confirms that with [1,2,5] the machine is on.\n\n13. > take object 2 off the machine\n    - Now on machine: [1,5]   (removed 2)\n    - Machine: still on\n\n    So the machine remains on with [1,5].\n\nNow, let's analyze the blickets.

Then we put 5 back and it turned on.\n\n- Also note: when we had [1,2,5] the machine was on. Then we removed 2 and had [1,5] and the machine stayed on.\n\n- Now, what about object 0? We removed object 0 in step 9, and at that time the machine was still on. Moreover, when we removed object 0, the set was [1,2,3,5] and then became [1,2,3,5] without 0 -> [1,2,3,5] without 0 was still on.

Then we removed 6,4,0,3 and the machine remained on (so only 1,2,5 were on and it was on). Then removing 5 turned it off. Then putting 5 back (with 1 and 2 still on? Actually, when we removed 5, we had only 1 and 2 on the machine and it turned off. Then we put 5 back and it turned on (so 1,2,5 again). Then we removed 2 and it stayed on (so 1 and 5).\n\nSo the machine is on when at least both 1 and 5 are present? But note that at the beginning we had only object 0 on the machine and it was off. Then we added 4,6,3,5,2 without turning on until we added 1.\n\nSo the turning on event when adding 1 happened when the set was {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.

So we cannot tell if 1 alone would turn it on because 5 was already there.\n\nBut let's see the removals: when we removed 5 (step 11) and left only 1 and 2, the machine turned off. Then putting 5 back (step 12) turned it on. Then removing 2 (step 13) left 1 and 5 and the machine remained on.\n\nNow, what if we had only 1 and 5? We see that the machine is on.

Then adding object 1 turned it on. So object 1 is critical.\n\n - After removing several objects (6,4,0,3) the machine remained on until we removed object 5. Then the machine turned off. Then putting object 5 back turned it on. This suggests that object 5 is critical.\n\n - Now, when we remove object 2 (step 13) after having put object 5 back (so the machine is on with objects: 1,2,5? Let's reconstruct the set at that point).\n\n Let's reconstruct the set of objects on the machine at step 13 (before removing object 2):\n\n   After step 12: We put object 5 on the machine and the machine turned on. What objects are on the machine?\n      We had taken off: 6,4,0,3,5 (at step 11) and then we put 5 back (step 12). \n      After step 11: We had taken off 6,4,0,3,5. So the objects that were left on the machine from before were: 1 and 2? \n        Actually, let's list the objects that were on the machine at step 6 (when the machine turned on): 0,4,6,3,5,2,1.\n        Then we removed 6 -> still on -> objects: 0,4,3,5,2,1\n        Then removed 4 -> still on -> objects: 0,3,5,2,1\n        Then removed 0 -> still on -> objects: 3,5,2,1\n        Then removed 3 -> still on -> objects: 5,2,1\n        Then removed 5 -> turned off -> objects: 2,1\n\n        Then step 12: put object 5 back -> so now objects: 2,1,5 -> machine turns on.\n\n        Then step 13: remove object 2 -> machine remains on -> objects: 1,5.\n\n So the machine remains on when we remove object 2. This suggests that object 2 is not necessary to keep the machine on.\n\n But is object 2 a blicket? We must consider if its presence ever caused the machine to turn on? Or if its absence ever caused it to turn off?\n\n Let's look at when the machine turned on:\n\n   The first time the machine turned on was when we added object 1 to the set that included 0,4,6,3,5,2.

Put object 4 on machine -> light off.\n   - Machine has objects 0 and 4.\n   - Still off.\n\n2. Put object 6 on machine -> light off.\n   - Machine: 0,4,6 -> off.\n\n3. Put object 3 on machine -> light off.\n   - Machine: 0,3,4,6 -> off.\n\n4. Put object 5 on machine -> light off.\n   - Machine: 0,3,4,5,6 -> off.\n\n5. Put object 2 on machine -> light off.\n   - Machine: 0,2,3,4,5,6 -> off.\n\n6. Put object 1 on machine -> light turns on.\n   - Machine: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -> on.\n\nSo, adding object 1 caused the machine to turn on. This suggests that object 1 is necessary at this point, but note that there are many objects on the machine.\n\nNow, removal actions:\n\n7. Take object 6 off -> light remains on.\n   - Machine: 0,1,2,3,4,5 -> still on.\n\n8. Take object 4 off -> light remains on.\n   - Machine: 0,1,2,3,5 -> on.\n\n9. Take object 0 off -> light remains on.\n   - Machine: 1,2,3,5 -> on.\n\n10. Take object 3 off -> light remains on.\n    - Machine: 1,2,5 -> on.\n\n11. Take object 5 off -> light turns off.\n    - Machine: 1,2 -> off.\n\nThis is critical: when object 5 was removed, the machine turned off. So, at that point, the machine had objects 1 and 2 and was off. Then:\n\n12. Put object 5 back on -> light turns on.\n    - Machine: 1,2,5 -> on.\n\n13. Take object 2 off -> light remains on.\n    - Machine: 1,5 -> on.\n\nNow, we are to determine if object 3 is a blicket.\n\nDefinition: A blicket is an object whose state (on machine or not) is not independent of the machine state (i.e., it has an effect on the machine).\n\nLet's try to infer the rule:\n\nFrom the sequence:\n\n- When we had objects 0,2,3,4,5,6 (without 1) -> machine off.\n- Adding 1 turned it on.\n\nBut then we removed many objects and the machine stayed on until we removed object 5 (at step 11) when the machine had only 1 and 2 and turned off. Then putting 5 back turned it on.\n\nAlso, note that after step 11, the machine had 1 and 2 and was off. Then putting 5 on turned it on. So object 5 by itself (when added to 1 and 2) turned the machine on.\n\nBut also, when we had 1,2,5 and we removed 2 (step 13) and left 1 and 5, the machine stayed on. So having 1 and 5 is enough to keep the machine on.\n\nNow, what about object 3? In step 10, we removed object 3 from the machine (which had 1,2,3,5) and the machine remained on. So removing object 3 did not turn off the machine. This suggests that object 3 is not necessary for the machine to be on at that point.\n\nMoreover, when we first added objects (steps 1-5) without object 1, the machine did not turn on even though object 3 was on the machine (along with others). Then when we added object 1, it turned on. But note that when we had 0,3,4,5,6 without 1 and 2, it was off. Then we added 2 (step 5) and it was still off, and then adding 1 turned it on.\n\nSo let's try to see what minimal sets turn the machine on.\n\nFrom step 6: adding 1 to the set {0,2,3,4,5,6} turned it on. But then we saw that we can remove 0,3,4,6 and still have it on with {1,2,5}. Then removing 5 turned it off. Then adding 5 turned it on again.

Then adding 1: on.\n- Then removing 6,4,0,3: machine remains on.\n- Removing 5: machine turns off -> so at that point, without object 5, the machine turns off. But note that objects 1 and 2 were still on the machine when we removed 5 and it turned off. Then putting 5 back (with 1 and 2 still there) turns it on. Then removing 2 (leaving 1 and 5) keeps it on.\n\nSo what can we infer?\n\nThe machine turned on only when object 1 was added (step 6). But note that at that point, we had added objects 4,6,3,5,2 and then 1. Also, object 0 was already on the machine. So when we added 1, the machine turned on. This suggests that object 1 might be a blicket? But let's see the removals.\n\nAfter having many objects on the machine (0,1,2,3,4,5,6), we start removing:\n\n- Removing 6: machine stays on -> so 6 is not necessary for the machine to be on?

But then we put 5 back and it turns on again.\n\nAlso, note that after removing 5, we had objects 1 and 2 on the machine and the machine was off. Then we put 5 back and the machine turned on. So with 1,2,5 the machine is on.\n\nThen we remove object 2 and the machine remains on (so now only 1 and 5). Therefore, the machine can be on with just 1 and 5?

Take object 2 off -> light remains on.\n\nNow, we are asked: is object 6 a blicket?\n\nDefinition: A blicket is an object that is not independent of the machine state. In other words, the machine state depends on whether the blicket is on the machine or not? But note: the rule might be complex (e.g., requiring a specific combination).\n\nWe need to figure out the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nLet's try to see what changes when the machine turns on and off.\n\nFirst time the machine turns on: when object 1 is added to the set. At that point, the objects on the machine are: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut note that we then remove several objects and the light remains on until we remove object 5. Then when we put object 5 back, the light turns on again.\n\nAlso, after removing object 5 (step 11), the light turns off, and then putting object 5 back (step 12) turns it on.\n\nMoreover, after removing object 2 (step 13) the light remains on. So at that point, the objects on the machine are 1 and 5 (since we removed 2 and left 1 and 5).\n\nLet me note the state of the machine at each step:\n\n- Initially: objects = [0] -> off\n- After adding 4: [0,4] -> off\n- After adding 6: [0,4,6] -> off\n- After adding 3: [0,3,4,6] -> off\n- After adding 5: [0,3,4,5,6] -> off\n- After adding 2: [0,2,3,4,5,6] -> off\n- After adding 1: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] -> on\n\nSo when we have all 7 objects (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) the machine turns on? But then we start removing:\n\n- Remove 6: [0,1,2,3,4,5] -> on\n- Remove 4: [0,1,2,3,5] -> on\n- Remove 0: [1,2,3,5] -> on\n- Remove 3: [1,2,5] -> on\n- Remove 5: [1,2] -> off\n\nSo removing 5 turns the machine off. Then:\n\n- Put 5 back: [1,2,5] -> on\n- Remove 2: [1,5] -> on\n\nSo we see that the machine is on with [1,5] and also with [1,2,5]. But it was off with [1,2] and on with [1,2,5]. Therefore, the presence of object 5 is critical.\n\nAlso, note that when we had [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] the machine was on, and then we removed 6 and 4 and 0 and 3 and it remained on until 5 was removed.\n\nNow, what about object 1? It was added and then the machine turned on. But note that when we had [1,2] the machine was off, but when we had [1,5] the machine was on?

Let's analyze step by step to infer which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on.\n\nInitial state:\n- Machine light: off\n- Objects on machine: [0]\n- Objects on floor: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n\nActions and outcomes:\n\n1. Put object 4 on machine -> light off\n2. Put object 6 on machine -> light off\n3. Put object 3 on machine -> light off\n4. Put object 5 on machine -> light off\n5. Put object 2 on machine -> light off\n6. Put object 1 on machine -> light on\n\nAt this point, the machine turns on. So the objects on the machine are: [0,4,6,3,5,2,1] (all except 7). The light turns on when object 1 is added.\n\nThen removal actions:\n\n7. Take object 6 off -> light still on\n8. Take object 4 off -> light still on\n9. Take object 0 off -> light still on\n10. Take object 3 off -> light still on\n11. Take object 5 off -> light off\n\nAfter removing object 5, the light turns off. So now the objects on the machine are: [2,1] (since we started with [0,4,6,3,5,2,1] and removed 6,4,0,3,5).\n\nThen:\n12. Put object 5 on the machine -> light on\n13. Take object 2 off the machine -> light on\n\nAfter step 12: objects on machine: [2,1,5] -> light on.\nAfter step 13: remove object 2 -> objects on machine: [1,5] -> light remains on.\n\nNow, we are to determine if object 7 is a blicket.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object that is not independent of the machine state. That is, whether it is on the machine or not affects the machine.\n\nBut note: object 7 has never been placed on the machine. So we have no direct evidence about it.\n\nWe must infer the rule from the interactions.\n\nLet's try to figure out the rule:\n\nFrom the first time the machine turned on (step 6): \n- Objects on machine: [0,4,6,3,5,2,1] -> light on.\n\nBut note that after removing several objects (steps 7-10), the light remained on until step 11 (removing object 5) turned it off.\n\nThen when we put object 5 back (step 12), it turned on again.\n\nAlso, note that after step 13 (removing object 2) the light remained on.\n\nSo what are the critical objects?\n\nWe see that the machine turned on when object 1 was added to the set that included [0,4,6,3,5,2]. But then we removed many objects and the light stayed on until we removed object 5. Then putting object 5 back turned it on.\n\nMoreover, after having [1,5] on the machine, the light is on. And removing object 2 (which was on the machine with [1,5]) did not turn it off.\n\nSo let's consider what objects are necessary:\n\n- When we had [0,4,6,3,5,2,1] and removed 6,4,0,3, the light stayed on until we removed 5. Then it went off. Then adding 5 back turned it on.\n\nThis suggests that object 5 is necessary for the machine to be on? But note that when we had [1,5] and then removed object 2 (which was part of the set when we had [2,1,5]), the light stayed on. So with [1,5] the machine is on.\n\nBut what about when we started? Initially we had [0] and the machine was off. Then we added 4,6,3,5,2 and it was still off until we added 1. So adding 1 turned it on.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if both object 1 and object 5 are on the machine? But note that when we had [1,5] the machine was on. Also, when we had [0,4,6,3,5,2,1] the machine was on. But when we had [0,4,6,3,5,2] (without 1) the machine was off. And when we had [1] without 5? We never had that.\n\nWait: after step 11, we removed object 5 and the machine turned off. At that point, the objects on the machine were [1,2]. But the machine turned off.
