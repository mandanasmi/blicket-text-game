The machine turns off. This suggests that object 3 alone is not enough to turn the machine on. Therefore, object 3 might not be a blicket? But wait, we know that object 5 was able to turn the machine on by itself. However, when we remove object 5, the machine turns off even with object 3 still on. This implies that object 3 is not a blicket? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket? But note: when we had both 5 and 3, the machine was on.

We need to see when the machine turns on and off in relation to the objects.\n\nInitial state: All objects on floor, machine off.\n\nStep 1:\n> put object 5 on the machine -> machine turns on.\nThis suggests that object 5 might be a blicket.

We just added 4 and the machine turned on. This suggests that object 4 might be a blicket.\n\nBut note: we had objects 3, 6, and 2 already on the machine and it was off. Then we added 4 and it turned on. So 4 is likely a blicket. However, we must also consider that 3 might be a blicket? But in step 3, when we removed 5 (and left 3) the machine turned off. So 3 alone or with non-blickets didn't turn it on? Actually, at step 2 we had both 5 and 3 and the machine was on. Then removing 5 turned it off. Then we added 6 and 2 (which didn't turn it on) and then adding 4 turned it on. So perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on when at least one blicket is present?

Then removing 5 turned it off, meaning that with only 3 the machine did not turn on.\n\n What does this tell us about object 3?\n - When object 3 was the only object on the machine (after removing 5), the machine was off. So object 3 alone does not turn on the machine.\n - But note: when we had objects 3, 6, 2, and 4 on the machine and then removed 3, the machine stayed on.

But note:\n\n   We have two clear blicket candidates: \n      object 5: because when it was alone, the machine was on.\n      object 4: because when it was added (to objects 3,6,2) the machine turned on.

But wait, after removing object5, the machine turns off. This suggests that object5 was the one keeping the machine on? Or maybe both are needed? But note that when we removed object5, the machine turned off even though object3 was still there. This implies that object3 alone is not enough to turn the machine on? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine is on only when at least one blicket is on it? But then why did the machine turn off when removing object5? Because object3 was still there?

So with only object3, the machine is off.\n\n   Therefore, object3 alone does not turn the machine on. But when we added object3 in step2, the machine was already on (because of object5).

So either object6 is not a blicket, or the rule requires more than one blicket? But note that in step1, putting object5 alone turned it on. So object5 is a blicket. And now with object3 and object6, the machine is off. So if the rule is that at least one blicket is needed, then since object5 was a blicket and now we have object3 and object6, if neither of them is a blicket then the machine should be off. That is consistent.\n\n   However, we still don't know about object3. We know that when object5 was removed and only object3 was left, the machine turned off. So object3 alone is not sufficient. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not a blicket? It could be that the rule requires a specific condition (like two blickets) but we saw that one blicket (object5) was enough? So let's reconsider: maybe the machine turns on if and only if there is at least one blicket on it? Then:\n\n   - Step1: object5 on -> machine on -> object5 is a blicket.\n   - Step2: object3 added -> machine remains on -> doesn't tell us about object3 because the machine was already on.\n   - Step3: remove object5 -> machine off -> so without object5 and with object3, the machine is off. Therefore, object3 is not a blicket? Because if it were, the machine would have stayed on? But wait, what if the machine requires all blickets to be present? That doesn't seem to be the case because step1 had only one object and it turned on.\n\n   So the rule seems to be: the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\n\n   Therefore, step3: removing object5 leaves only object3 and the machine turns off.

Or that the rule requires a combination.\n\n   However, note that after removing object 5, the machine turned off even though object 3 was still on. This implies that object 3 is not a blicket? Or that the rule requires more than one blicket? We have to be cautious.\n\n   Alternatively, let's think: the machine was on with both 5 and 3. When we remove 5, the machine turns off. This suggests that the machine requires at least one blicket to be present? But then if 3 were a blicket, the machine should have stayed on? Unless the rule is more complex.\n\n   Actually, the machine turning off when 5 is removed suggests that 5 is a blicket and 3 is not.

But wait, if 4 is a blicket, then why didn't the machine turn on when we put 4 on? Actually, it did turn on at that step.\n\n   However, note that the machine was off before putting 4, and then turned on after. So 4 must be a blicket? But we also have 3,6,2 on the machine.

We removed object 3 (which we suspected was not a blicket) and the machine stayed on. This confirms that 3 was not necessary. Now we have 6,2,4 and the machine is on.

We need to determine if object 7 is a blicket. A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine. In other words, the presence or absence of the object on the machine should affect whether the machine turns on.\n\nWe must infer the rule for the machine turning on. Let's go step by step through the history:\n\n1. Initially, all objects are on the floor, machine is off.\n2. Put object 5 on: machine turns on. This suggests that object 5 might be a blicket, or part of a rule that turns the machine on.\n3. Put object 3 on: machine remains on. Since it was already on, this doesn't tell us much about object 3 by itself. But note: if object 3 were a non-blicket, adding it shouldn't change the state? However, the machine was already on so we don't know.\n4. Take object 5 off: machine turns off. This suggests that object 5 was critical for the machine being on. Since removing it turned the machine off, and object 3 is still on the machine, we can infer that object 3 alone is not enough to keep the machine on. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket? Or perhaps the rule requires multiple blickets? But note: when we had both 5 and 3, the machine was on. Then removing 5 made it turn off. So if object 3 were a blicket, then with object 3 alone the machine should have stayed on? But it turned off. Therefore, object 3 might not be a blicket.\n\nLet me reexamine: when we took object 5 off, the machine turned off even though object 3 was still on. This implies that object 3, by itself, does not activate the machine. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine requires at least one blicket? Then if object 5 is the only blicket so far, then removing it leaves no blicket, so machine turns off. But what about when we added object 3? The machine stayed on, which is consistent because we still had at least one blicket (object 5).\n\n5. Put object 6 on: machine remains off. This suggests that object 6 alone (with no other objects on the machine) does not turn the machine on. So object 6 is not a blicket? But note: at this point, the machine is off and we are adding object 6. It doesn't turn on. So object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n6. Put object 2 on: machine remains off. Similarly, adding object 2 to the machine (which now has object 6) doesn't turn it on. So object 2 is not a blicket? Or perhaps we need a specific combination.\n\n7. Put object 4 on: machine turns on. At this point, the machine has objects 6, 2, and 4. The machine turns on when we add object 4. This suggests that object 4 is a blicket? But note that the machine was off until we added object 4. Therefore, object 4 must be a blicket because adding it caused the machine to turn on (and we had non-blickets 6 and 2 already on, which didn't turn it on).\n\nBut wait: what if the rule requires at least two blickets? Then we would have to see if there was another blicket already. At this point, the only objects on the machine are 6, 2, and then we add 4. Since 6 and 2 were already on and the machine was off, they are not blickets. So adding 4 (a blicket) would then turn the machine on? But if the rule is at least one blicket, then adding 4 should turn it on. So that fits.\n\n8. Take object 3 off: wait, object 3 was already off? Let me check: we took object 5 off earlier, and then we put 6, 2, and 4 on. So at this point, the objects on the machine are 6, 2, and 4. The machine is on. Then we take object 3 off. But object 3 was not on the machine! How can we take it off? Let me reread:\n\n> take object 3 off the machine\n\nBut in step 3 we put object 3 on, and then in step 4 we took object 5 off (leaving object 3 on). Then we put 6, 2, and 4 on.
