This suggests that object 6 alone is not sufficient to keep the machine on.\n\nBut note that when we had objects 1, 5, and 6, the machine was on. Then removing object 5 (leaving 1 and 6) kept the machine on. Then removing object 1 (leaving only 6) turned the machine off.\n\nThis implies that the machine being on requires more than one object? Or perhaps a specific combination.\n\nLet's think about when the machine turned on: when object 6 was added to the set {1,5}. So the set {1,5,6} turned it on.\n\nBut then when we removed object 5, the set {1,6} kept it on. Then removing object 1 left only 6 and it turned off.\n\nSo the machine was on with {1,6}. Therefore, object 6 alone is not enough, but together with object 1 it is. This suggests that object 1 and object 6 together are sufficient to turn the machine on? But note that when we first added object 1 (alone) it didn't turn on, and then adding 5 (so {1,5}) also didn't turn on. Only when 6 was added did it turn on.\n\nSo let's reexamine:\n\n- {1} -> off\n- {1,5} -> off\n- {1,5,6} -> on\n\nThen:\n- Removing 5: {1,6} -> remains on\n- Removing 1: {6} -> off\n\nSo the machine turned on when we had {1,5,6}. But then {1,6} is also on. Why didn't {1,5} turn it on? It might be that object 6 is a blicket and the rule requires at least one blicket and also that the blicket must be accompanied by at least one other object? Or perhaps the rule is that the machine turns on if and only if there are at least two blickets on the machine.\n\nBut note that in {1,5,6} we had three objects. Then we removed 5 and had {1,6} which is two objects and the machine stayed on. Then we removed 1 and had only 6 (one object) and it turned off.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: the machine turns on if at least two blickets are on the machine.\n\nBut then we need to figure out which objects are blickets.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- When we added object 1 (alone): off -> so object 1 alone is not sufficient. This doesn't tell us if it's a blicket because the rule might require two.\n\n- Then added object 5: {1,5} -> off. This also doesn't turn on. So if the rule requires two blickets, then either 1 is not a blicket, or 5 is not a blicket, or both are not.\n\n- Then added object 6: {1,5,6} -> on. This turned on. So at this point we have at least two blickets in {1,5,6}. Therefore, among {1,5,6} there are at least two blickets.\n\n- Then we removed object 5: leaving {1,6} -> machine remains on. This means that {1,6} is sufficient. So at least two blickets are present in {1,6}. Therefore, both 1 and 6 must be blickets? Because if only one of them was a blicket, then we wouldn't have two blickets and the machine would turn off.\n\n- Then we removed object 1: leaving {6} -> off.

The machine turns on when object 6 is added. This suggests that object 6 is likely a blicket because adding it caused the machine to turn on.

This is interesting because at step 3, when we added object 6, the machine turned on even with objects 1 and 5 present. Then, removing object 5 did not turn it off, but removing object 1 turned it off.\n\nLet's think about the state of the machine:\n\n- When objects 1, 5, and 6 were on the machine: machine on.\n- Removing object 5: machine still on (so object 5 is not necessary to keep it on).\n- Removing object 1: machine turns off.\n\nBut note that object 6 is still on the machine when we remove object 1. If object 6 were the only blicket, then having object 6 alone should keep the machine on. However, after removing object 1 (and having only object 6 on the machine), the machine turns off.\n\nThis implies that object 6 alone is not sufficient to turn the machine on? But wait, at step 3 we added object 6 to objects 1 and 5 and the machine turned on. Then when we remove object 5 (leaving 1 and 6) the machine stays on, and then when we remove object 1 (leaving only 6) the machine turns off.\n\nSo the machine turned on when we had at least objects 1 and 6 together? Or perhaps object 1 is a blicket and object 6 is a blicket, but they are both required? But note that when we had objects 1 and 5 (without 6) the machine was off. Then adding 6 turned it on. Then removing 5 (leaving 1 and 6) kept it on. Then removing 1 (leaving 6) turned it off.\n\nTherefore, it seems that both object 1 and object 6 are blickets, and the rule might be that both must be present? But wait, what about when we had object 1 and 5? That didn't turn it on. So object 5 is not a blicket? And when we had only object 6, it turned off? So the machine requires both object 1 and object 6 to be present? That would be an AND rule.\n\nAlternatively, consider if the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present? But that doesn't fit because:\n- Initially, with no objects, machine off -> okay.\n- Add object 1: off -> so if object 1 were a blicket, it should turn on? But it didn't. So object 1 might not be a blicket? But then why when we removed object 1 at the end the machine turned off? That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, let me reexamine:\n\nStep 1: put object 1 -> machine off. So if object 1 were a blicket and the rule were OR, then the machine should have turned on. But it didn't. So object 1 is not a blicket? But then step 5: removing object 1 caused the machine to turn off? That would be odd if it's not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is more complex. Let's consider the possibility that the machine requires at least two blickets? Or a specific combination.\n\nBut let's look at the turning on event: when we put object 6 (the third object) the machine turned on. So at that moment, we had objects 1, 5, and 6. Then we removed object 5 (non-blicket?) and the machine stayed on. Then we removed object 1 and it turned off.\n\nThis suggests that object 1 and object 6 are both blickets, and the machine requires both to be present? That is an AND rule.\n\nBut why didn't the machine turn on when we put object 1?

Then takes object 1 off (now only object 6 is on) -> machine turns off.\n\nWe need to infer the rule for the machine turning on and which objects are blickets.\n\nFrom step 4: when objects 1, 5, and 6 are on the machine, the machine turns on.\nFrom step 5: after removing object 5 (leaving 1 and 6), the machine stays on. This suggests that the machine does not require object 5 to be present to stay on, but note that the rule might be about the set of objects that are on the machine.\n\nThen in step 6: after removing object 1 (leaving only 6), the machine turns off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine requires at least one blicket to be on, but note that when only object 6 was on, the machine turned off? Actually, step 6 says: after removing object 1 (so only object 6 is left), the machine turns off.\n\nBut in step 5, when objects 1 and 6 were on (without 5), the machine was on. Then when object 1 was removed, leaving only 6, the machine turned off.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce:\n\n- The machine turned on when 1,5,6 were added (but note that 5 was then removed and the machine stayed on until 1 was removed). So the critical set that kept the machine on after step 4 was at least one of 1 or 6? Because when both 1 and 6 were present (without 5) the machine was on, but when only 6 was present the machine turned off.\n\nWait, let's reexamine:\n\n- Step 4: putting 6 on (with 1 and 5 already on) causes the machine to turn on. This could be because of the addition of 6, or because the combination of 1 and 5 and 6 together satisfies the rule.\n\n- Step 5: removing 5 leaves 1 and 6 on, and the machine remains on. This implies that 5 is not necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n- Step 6: removing 1 leaves only 6 on, and the machine turns off. This implies that with only 6, the machine is off.\n\nBut note that in step 4, the machine turned on when 6 was added. So why does the machine turn off when we remove 1 and leave 6? This suggests that the machine requires at least two blickets? Or perhaps that the rule is not just about the presence of one blicket.\n\nAlternatively, consider the possibility that the rule is an AND of two blickets? But we have three objects involved: 1, 5, 6. When we have 1 and 5 (without 6) the machine was off. Then adding 6 turned it on. Then removing 5 (leaving 1 and 6) kept it on. Then removing 1 (leaving 6) turned it off.\n\nThis suggests that the machine is on if and only if both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine? Because:\n\n- When 1 and 5 were on (without 6): off -> because 6 is missing? But that doesn't fit because then why would adding 6 turn it on? And then removing 5 (leaving 1 and 6) kept it on? And removing 1 (leaving 6) turned it off.\n\nAlternatively, what if the rule is that the machine requires object 1 OR object 6? But then when only object 1 was on (with object 5, which might not be a blicket) the machine was off. And when only object 6 was on, the machine turned off. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: the rule might be that the machine turns on when both object 1 and object 6 are present?

But wait: when we had objects 1, 5, and 6, the machine was on. Then we removed 5 and the machine stayed on (so now 1 and 6 are on). Then we removed 1 and the machine turned off (only 6 left).\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\n- With object 6 alone: machine off? (because at the end when only 6 is on, the machine turned off after removing 1 and 5). But note: when we added 6 to 1 and 5, the machine turned on. So the rule must involve more than one object.\n\nPossible rules:\n\n- The machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine? But note that when we had 1, 5, and 6, it was on. Then we removed 5 and it stayed on (so 1 and 6 together are sufficient). Then we removed 1 and it turned off (so without 1, even with 6, it turns off). Also, when we had only 1 and 5 (without 6) it was off.\n\nBut what about object 5? When we had 1 and 5 without 6, the machine was off. Then we added 6 and it turned on. Then we removed 5 and it stayed on. So object 5 doesn't seem necessary. So the rule might be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine.\n\nLet's test:\n\n- At the beginning: no objects -> off (matches).\n- After putting 1: only 1 -> off (matches: because we need both 1 and 6).\n- After putting 5: 1 and 5 -> off (matches: still missing 6).\n- After putting 6: now 1, 5, 6 -> we have both 1 and 6 -> on (matches).\n- Remove 5: now 1 and 6 -> still both -> on (matches).\n- Remove 1: now only 6 -> missing 1 -> off (matches).\n\nSo the rule seems to be: the machine turns on if and only if object 1 and object 6 are both on the machine.\n\nTherefore, the blickets are objects that are necessary for the machine to turn on. In this rule, object 1 and object 6 are necessary and sufficient (together). Object 5 is not necessary because when we removed it, the machine stayed on as long as 1 and 6 were present.\n\nSo which objects are blickets?

Machine is off.\n\nAction 1: put object 1 on the machine -> machine remains off.\nAction 2: put object 5 on the machine -> machine remains off.\nAction 3: put object 6 on the machine -> machine turns on.\n\nSo, after putting objects 1, 5, and 6 on the machine, the machine turns on.\n\nNow, the agent removes object 5:\nAction 4: take object 5 off -> machine remains on.\n\nThen, the agent removes object 1:\nAction 5: take object 1 off -> machine turns off.\n\nWe need to figure out the rule for the machine turning on and which objects are blickets.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n\n- When objects 1, 5, and 6 are on the machine, the machine is on.\n- Removing object 5 (leaving 1 and 6) -> machine remains on.\n- Removing object 1 (leaving only 6) -> machine turns off.\n\nSo, what can we infer?\n\n1. The machine turned on when object 6 was added to the set that already had objects 1 and 5. But note that with only objects 1 and 5, the machine was off (as per actions 1 and 2). So the activation must involve object 6.\n\n2. After having all three (1,5,6) on, removing object 5 did not turn off the machine. This suggests that object 5 is not necessary for keeping the machine on at that point. But note that the machine remained on with objects 1 and 6.\n\n3. Then, removing object 1 caused the machine to turn off. So with only object 6 left, the machine turned off.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that the machine requires at least two blickets to be on? Or perhaps a specific set?\n\nLet me try to think about the state transitions:\n\n- State A: [1,5] -> off\n- State B: [1,5,6] -> on\n- Then remove 5: [1,6] -> on\n- Then remove 1: [6] -> off\n\nSo, the machine was on when the set included {1,6} (and also when {1,5,6} and {1,6}).\n\nBut note that when we had only object 1 and 5, it was off. Then adding 6 turned it on. So the critical change was adding 6.\n\nHowever, when we remove 1 (leaving only 6) it turns off. And when we had only 1 and 5 it was off. So what is the rule?\n\nPossibilities:\n\nRule 1: The machine turns on if at least two blickets are on the machine? But then note: when we had only 1 and 5 (two objects) the machine was off. So that would imply that at least one of 1 or 5 is not a blicket? But then when we have 1 and 6, the machine is on. So if 1 and 6 are blickets, then why was the machine off when we had 1 and 5? Unless 5 is not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the machine turns on only when a specific blicket (like 6) is present? But note that when we have only 6, the machine is off. So it must be that the machine requires at least two blickets, and one of them must be 6? Or a specific combination.\n\nLet me list the blickets:\n\n- Object 1: When it was on the machine with 5, the machine was off. When it was with 6, the machine was on. And when we removed 1 from the set that had 1 and 6, the machine turned off. So object 1 must be a blicket? Because its removal caused the machine to turn off when only 6 was left? But note that when we removed 1, the set became only 6 and the machine turned off. So if 1 is a blicket, then why was the machine off when we had only 1 and 5? Unless 5 is not a blicket.\n\nSimilarly, object 5: when we had 1 and 5, the machine was off. Then we added 6 and it turned on. Then we removed 5 and the machine stayed on. So 5 might not be a blicket? Because removing it didn't change the state from on to off? But note that when we removed 5, the machine was still on because we had 1 and 6.

In simpler terms, the presence of the blicket on the machine affects whether the machine is on.\n\nWe need to figure out the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\nLet's consider the state transitions:\n\n1. When only object 1 is on the machine: machine off.\n2. When objects 1 and 5 are on the machine: machine off.\n3. When objects 1, 5, and 6 are on the machine: machine turns on.\n\nThen:\n4. After removing object 5 (so objects 1 and 6 are on): machine remains on.\n5. After removing object 1 (so only object 6 is on): machine turns off.\n\nFrom step 4: with objects 1 and 6 on the machine, the machine is on. This suggests that having object 6 on the machine is important because when we had only 1 and 5 (without 6) the machine was off, but when we added 6 it turned on.\n\nBut then in step 5: when we remove object 1 (leaving only object 6) the machine turns off. This is inconsistent if we thought that object 6 alone is sufficient? Wait, let's reexamine:\n\n- After step 3: objects 1, 5, 6 are on -> machine on.\n- Step 4: remove 5 -> objects 1 and 6 are on -> machine remains on.\n- Step 5: remove 1 -> object 6 alone -> machine turns off.\n\nSo, when only object 6 is on the machine, the machine is off. But when both 1 and 6 are on, the machine is on.\n\nThis suggests that the machine turns on only when both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine? But let's check the earlier steps:\n\n- Step 1: put 1 on -> off (so 1 alone is not enough).\n- Step 2: put 5 on (so 1 and 5) -> off.\n- Step 3: put 6 on (so 1,5,6) -> on.\n\nThen when we remove 5 (leaving 1 and 6) the machine remains on. Then remove 1 (leaving 6) and it turns off.\n\nTherefore, the machine is on only when both object 1 and object 6 are present? But note that in step 3 we had three objects and it turned on, and then when we removed 5 (which was present at the time) it stayed on. So 5 doesn't seem necessary.\n\nAlso, note that when we had objects 1 and 5 (without 6) the machine was off. And when we had only object 1 it was off. And when we had only object 6 it was off. But when we had 1 and 6 (without 5) the machine was on.\n\nSo the rule might be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine.\n\nBut what about object 5? We never saw the machine turn on with object 5 alone or in combinations without 1 and 6. And when we removed object 5 (step 4) the machine remained on because we still had 1 and 6. Then when we removed 1 (step 5) the machine turned off.\n\nSo, object 5 does not seem to be necessary. Moreover, when we had object 5 on the machine with object 1 (without 6) the machine was off. And when we had all three (1,5,6) the machine was on, but that was because of 1 and 6? And when we removed 5, the machine stayed on. So 5 is not required.\n\nTherefore, object 5 is not a blicket?

But when we removed object 1, the machine turned off even though object 6 was still there. So it seems that the machine requires at least two blickets? Or perhaps object 6 alone is not enough, but object 1 and 6 together are.\n\nBut let's consider the possibility that object 6 is a blicket and object 1 is also a blicket. Then:\n\n- When we had {1, 5} (with 5 not being a blicket) the machine was off because only one blicket (object 1) was present?

We see that when we had only object 6 on the machine, the machine was off. But that does not necessarily mean object 6 is not a blicket. In fact, the rule we inferred (at least two blickets) requires that there are at least two blickets. So object 6 could be a blicket, but we need another blicket (like object 1) to make the machine turn on.\n\nTherefore, object 6 is a blicket because:\n\n- When we added object 6 to the machine (which already had object 1 and 5), the machine turned on. Since object 5 is not a blicket (as removing it didn't turn off the machine when we had two blickets) and object 1 is a blicket (because when we removed it, the machine turned off even though object 6 was still there) then the activation must have been due to the presence of object 6 and object 1 together.

Then, when we removed object 5 (leaving 1 and 6) the machine stayed on. But when we removed object 1 (leaving only 6) the machine turned off.\n\nThis suggests:\n\n- Object 6 is necessary for the machine to be on? But note that when only 6 is present, the machine is off. So 6 alone is not enough.\n\nWhat about combinations?\n\n- {1,5} -> off\n- {1,5,6} -> on\n- {1,6} -> on\n- {6} -> off\n\nNotice that the machine is on when both object 1 and object 6 are present? But in the step where we had {1,5,6} the machine was on, and then when we took off 5 (leaving {1,6}) it remained on. Then when we took off 1 (leaving {6}) it turned off.\n\nSo the machine is on if and only if both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine? But wait, what about the step with {1,5}? That had object 1 but not 6, and the machine was off. Then when 6 was added, it turned on. Then when 1 was removed (leaving 6) it turned off. And when we removed 5 and had {1,6} it stayed on.\n\nThis suggests that the rule might be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine.\n\nBut what about object 5? It was present when the machine turned on (in the set {1,5,6}), but when we removed it and left {1,6} the machine stayed on. Also, when we had {1,5} without 6, the machine was off. So object 5 doesn't seem to matter.\n\nTherefore, the rule appears to be: the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 6 are on the machine.\n\nNow, what are the blickets? Recall that a blicket is an object whose state (on the machine or not) is not independent of the machine state. Specifically, the machine's state depends on the object's state.\n\n- Object 1: when it is on the machine without object 6 (like in the first step with only 1, or in the step with {1,5}) the machine is off. But when it is on the machine with object 6 (in {1,5,6} and {1,6}) the machine is on. So clearly the machine state depends on whether object 1 is present? But note: if object 1 is present and object 6 is not, then the machine is off. But if object 1 is present and object 6 is present, then the machine is on. So the machine's state depends on both. Therefore, object 1 is a blicket because its presence matters when object 6 is present? Actually, without object 1, the machine cannot be on (as we saw when only 6 was present, the machine was off). Similarly, without object 6, even with object 1 the machine is off.\n\nSo both object 1 and object 6 are blickets.\n\nWhat about object 5?
