Let's analyze the interactions step by step.\n\n Initial state:\n   Objects on machine: [1] (only object 1 was on the machine at the start)\n   Machine light: off\n\n After the initial state, the agent starts putting and taking objects.\n\n Important observations:\n\n 1. When the agent puts object 5, then 6, then 2: the machine turns on after putting 2.\n    - Initially: machine had object 1 (and then we added 5, 6, 2). After putting 2, the machine turned on.\n    - So at that point: objects on machine: [1,5,6,2] -> machine on.\n\n 2. Then the agent took object 6 off: machine remained on.\n    - Objects: [1,5,2] -> machine on.\n\n 3. Then took object 1 off: machine remained on.\n    - Objects: [5,2] -> machine on.\n\n 4.

But wait, the light was still on.\n    - Objects: [2] -> machine on.\n\n    This is a critical point: with only object 2 on the machine, the machine is on? But note that initially when only object 1 was on, the machine was off. So object 2 must be a blicket? However, we will see later that when we remove object 2, the machine turns off.\n\n 5. Then put object 1 back: machine on (so now objects: [2,1] -> on).\n\n 6. Then put object 3: machine on (objects: [2,1,3] -> on).\n\n 7. Then took object 2 off: machine turned off.\n    - So when we removed object 2, the machine turned off. This suggests that object 2 is critical.\n\n    Now, at this point, objects on machine: [1,3] and machine off.\n\n 8. Then put object 0: machine turned on.\n    - So putting object 0 caused the machine to turn on? Then objects: [1,3,0] -> on.\n\n 9. Then put object 6: machine on (objects: [1,3,0,6] -> on).\n\n 10. Took object 1 off: machine on (objects: [3,0,6] -> on).\n\n 11. Took object 6 off: machine on (objects: [3,0] -> on).\n\n 12. Took object 3 off: machine on (objects: [0] -> on).\n\n     This is another critical point: with only object 0 on the machine, the machine is on? Because after removing 3, we are left with only 0 and the machine is on.\n\n     But note: when we had only object 2 on the machine, the machine was on? And now with only object 0, it is on? So both 0 and 2 seem to turn the machine on by themselves? But then why did the machine turn off when we removed object 2 earlier when there were other objects?\n\n     Let me check step 7 again: when we had [1,3,2] and then removed 2, the machine turned off.

Let me list out all the interactions step by step to see when the machine turns on and off, and infer the rule.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: 1 (since it's on top)\n- Machine off\n\nActions:\n1. Put object 5 on machine \u2192 machine off\n2. Put object 6 on machine \u2192 machine off\n3. Put object 2 on machine \u2192 machine on (so turning on must involve object 2 or the combination)\n\nAfter putting 2 on, machine turns on. Previously, with 1,5,6 on, machine was off. Now with 2 added, it's on. So object 2 might be key.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\n4. Take object 6 off \u2192 machine on (still on)\n5. Take object 1 off \u2192 machine on (still on)\n6. Take object 5 off \u2192 machine on (still on)\n\nAt this point, only object 2 is on the machine, and machine is on. So with just object 2 on, machine is on. That suggests object 2 might be a blicket, and it alone can turn the machine on? But we need to check further.\n\n7. Put object 1 on \u2192 machine on (still on)\n8. Put object 3 on \u2192 machine on (still on)\n9. Take object 2 off \u2192 machine off\n\nWhen object 2 is removed, machine turns off. With objects 1 and 3 on, machine is off. So object 2 seems necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n10. Put object 0 on \u2192 machine on\n\nNow objects on machine: 0,1,3 (since 2 was taken off, and 0 added)\n\nMachine turns on when 0 is added. Previously with 1 and 3, it was off. Adding 0 turns it on. So object 0 might also be a blicket.\n\n11. Put object 6 on \u2192 machine on (still on)\n\n12. Take object 1 off \u2192 machine on (still on)\n\n13. Take object 6 off \u2192 machine on (still on)\n\nNow objects on machine: 0 and 3? Let's track:\n\nAfter step 10: put 0 on, objects on: 0,1,3 (machine on)\n\nStep 11: put 6 on, objects: 0,1,3,6 (on)\n\nStep 12: take 1 off, objects: 0,3,6 (on)\n\nStep 13: take 6 off, objects: 0,3 (on)\n\nMachine still on with only 0 and 3.\n\n14. Take object 3 off \u2192 machine on (still on)\n\nAfter taking 3 off, objects: only 0? Machine on.\n\nStep 14: take 3 off, objects: 0 (since 1 and 6 are off, only 0 on), machine on.\n\nSo with only object 0 on, machine is on.\n\nBut earlier, with only object 2 on, machine was on. And now with only object 0 on, machine is on. So both 0 and 2 seem to be able to turn the machine on by themselves? But let's confirm.\n\nFrom step 6: after taking 5 off, only object 2 on, machine on.\n\nFrom step 14: after taking 3 off, only object 0 on, machine on.\n\nNow, step 15: put object 5 on \u2192 machine on (still on with 0 and 5)\n\n16. Put object 2 on \u2192 machine on (still on, now 0,5,2)\n\n17. Put object 1 on \u2192 machine on (0,5,2,1)\n\n18. Put object 6 on \u2192 machine on (0,5,2,1,6)\n\n19.

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what the rule is for the machine turning on.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object whose state (on machine or not) is not independent of the machine's state (on/off). In other words, the presence or absence of a blicket on the machine affects whether the machine turns on.\n\nWe have 8 objects: 0 to 7.\n\nInitial state (before any actions):\n- Machine light is off.\n- Object 1 is on the machine, others (0,2,3,4,5,6,7) are on the floor.\n\nNow, let's go step by step and note the state of the machine and the objects on the machine at each action.\n\nWe'll denote the set of objects on the machine at a given time.

This strongly suggests that object 2 is a blicket and that the machine can be turned on by having at least one blicket? But wait, we had object 1 initially and the machine was off.\n\nWait, initially: only object 1 -> machine off. Then after step 3, we had multiple objects and then when we removed others, only object 2 remained and the machine stayed on. So object 2 alone can turn the machine on? Then why wasn't the machine on when only object 1 was there? Because object 1 might not be a blicket.\n\nStep 7: put object 1 on the machine\n  Objects: 2,1 -> machine remains on\n\nStep 8: put object 3 on the machine\n  Objects: 2,1,3 -> machine remains on\n\nStep 9: take object 2 off\n  Objects: 1,3 -> machine turns off\n\nThis is critical: when we remove object 2 (which was the only blicket we know so far) and leave objects 1 and 3, the machine turns off. This suggests that neither object 1 nor object 3 alone (or together without 2) can keep the machine on.\n\nSo at this point, we suspect that object 2 is a blicket and objects 1 and 3 are not.\n\nStep 10: put object 0 on the machine\n  Objects: 1,3,0 -> machine turns on\n\nWait, that's interesting.

A blicket is an object that has a non-independent relationship with the machine's state.\n\nLet's list the initial state:\n- Machine light is off.\n- Objects: \n  - 0: floor\n  - 1: machine\n  - 2: floor\n  - 3: floor\n  - 4: floor\n  - 5: floor\n  - 6: floor\n  - 7: floor\n\nNow, step by step:\n\n1. > put object 5 on the machine\n   - After: objects on machine: 1,5.

Light remains on.\n\n   At this point, only object 2 is on the machine and the light is on. This suggests that object 2 alone can keep the machine on? But note the initial state: object 1 was on the machine and the light was off. So object 1 alone was not enough. Also, when we added object 2 and the light turned on, but that was with multiple objects.\n\n   However, after removing 1,5, and then 5, we are left with only 2 and the light is on.

Light turns off.\n\n   This is crucial. When we remove object 2, the light turns off. So the machine turns off when object 2 is removed, even though objects 1 and 3 are still on. This suggests that object 2 is necessary for the machine to be on in that configuration? But note that in step 6, object 2 alone was on and the machine was on. Now, without object 2, the machine turns off.\n\n   Also, note that in step 9, after removing object 2, the objects on the machine are 1 and 3 and the light is off. So having 1 and 3 is not enough.\n\n10. > put object 0 on the machine\n    - After: objects on machine: 1,3,0.
