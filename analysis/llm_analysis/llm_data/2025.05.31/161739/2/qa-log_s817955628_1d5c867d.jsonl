Let's analyze step by step to infer the rule and which objects are blickets.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: only object 3 (since it's on top at start)\n- Machine light: off\n\nActions and results:\n\n1. Put object 2 on machine -> light remains off.\n   - Now on machine: 3 (initial) and 2.\n   - Light off.\n\n2. Put object 4 on machine -> light turns on.\n   - Now on machine: 3, 2, 4.\n   - Light on.\n\n   So, adding 4 caused the light to turn on. This suggests that either object 4 is a blicket or the combination of objects on the machine (which now includes 4) satisfies the rule.\n\n3. Take object 2 off -> light remains on.\n   - Now on machine: 3 and 4.\n   - Light on.\n\n   Removing 2 did not turn off the light. So object 2 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n\n4. Take object 3 off -> light remains on.\n   - Now on machine: only 4.\n   - Light on.\n\n   This is critical: with only object 4 on the machine, the light is on. Therefore, object 4 is a blicket and by itself can turn on the machine.\n\n5. Take object 4 off -> light turns off.\n   - Now on machine: nothing.\n   - Light off.\n\n   Confirms that without 4, the machine turns off.\n\n6. Put object 7 on -> light remains off.\n   - On machine: 7 only -> light off.\n\n7. Put object 1 on -> light remains off.\n   - On machine: 7 and 1 -> light off.\n\n8. Put object 6 on -> light remains off.\n   - On machine: 7, 1, 6 -> light off.\n\n9. Put object 5 on -> light turns on.\n   - On machine: 7, 1, 6, 5 -> light on.\n\n   So, adding 5 caused the light to turn on. This suggests that object 5 is a blicket? But note that the machine turned on when 5 was added to the existing set (7,1,6). However, we know from step 4 that 4 alone was sufficient. Now we have 5 being added and turning on the machine.\n\n10. Put object 3 on -> light remains on.\n    - On machine: 7,1,6,5,3 -> light on.\n\n11. Take object 3 off -> light remains on.\n    - On machine: 7,1,6,5 -> light on.\n\n12. Take object 6 off -> light remains on.\n    - On machine: 7,1,5 -> light on.\n\n13. Put object 4 on -> light remains on (but it was already on? The step says \"now on\", meaning it remains on? Actually, the step says: \"You put object 4 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" -> it was already on? But note, at step 12, we had objects 7,1,5 and light was on. Then we add 4 (which we know is a blicket) and the light remains on.\n\n14. Put object 0 on -> light remains on.\n    - On machine: 7,1,5,4,0 -> light on.\n\n15. Take object 7 off -> light remains on.\n    - On machine: 1,5,4,0 -> light on.\n\n16. Take object 1 off -> light remains on.\n    - On machine: 5,4,0 -> light on.\n\n17. Take object 4 off -> light remains on.\n    - On machine: 5 and 0 -> light on.\n\n    This is interesting: we removed 4 (a known blicket) and the light remains on. So the machine is still on with objects 5 and 0. This suggests that either 5 or 0 (or both) are blickets. But we know 5 was added in step 9 and caused the light to turn on when added to non-blickets? Let's check step 9 again.\n\n    In step 9, when we added 5 to [7,1,6] (which were on the machine and the light was off), the light turned on. So 5 must be a blicket. Now, in step 17, we have 5 and 0 and the light is on. We remove 4 (a blicket) and the light remains on. So 0 might not be necessary? But note that the light stayed on with 5 and 0.\n\n18.

The machine turns on based on which objects are on it, and some of these objects are blickets.

Let me list out the key interactions where the machine's state changes to infer the rule.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: object 3\n- Machine off\n\nAfter \"put object 2 on the machine\": machine off (no change)\nAfter \"put object 4 on the machine\": machine turns on. So, adding object 4 caused it to turn on. Before this, objects on machine were 2 and 3 (since 3 was already there, and 2 was added). But when 2 was added alone, nothing happened; it stayed off.

After removing 3, only 4 is on, and it stays on. So with only object 4, the machine is on.\n\nThen \"take object 4 off\": machine turns off. So when 4 is removed, it turns off. This suggests that object 4 alone can turn the machine on, and without it, it's off.\n\nBut let's see more.\n\nAfter taking 4 off, machine off. No objects on machine.\n\nThen \"put object 7 on\": machine off (no change)\n\n\"put object 1 on\": machine off (no change, still off)\n\n\"put object 6 on\": machine off (no change)\n\n\"put object 5 on\": machine turns on.

But wait, step 5: when we remove 4 (and nothing else is on) the machine turns off. So object 4 by itself can turn the machine on? But then:\n\n   However, note step 13: we put object 4 back on the machine when objects 7,1,5 were on and the machine was on. Then we added 0 and removed 7,1 and the machine stayed on. Then we removed 4 (step 17) and the machine remained on. So when we removed 4, the machine did not turn off even though 4 was the only blicket?

But then why when we remove 4 in step 5 it turned off? Because there was no other blicket? And in step 17, when we removed 4, we still had 5 and 0? So 5 must be a blicket? And 0? But we don't know about 0.\n\n Alternatively, the rule might be more complex. Let's list the objects that we suspect are blickets.\n\n Important observations:\n\n 1.

So 4 alone was keeping it on? But note step 4: after removing 3 (leaving 4) the machine was still on. Then removing 4 turned it off.\n\n - Step 9: putting 5 on (with [7,1,6]) turns the machine on. So 5 must be a blicket? Or perhaps the combination? But note that the machine was off until 5 was added.\n\n - Step 18: removing 5 (with other objects present: at that time the machine had 0,4,5?

Let's analyze step by step to infer which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine turning on.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object that affects the machine's state (non-zero mutual information). The machine turns on based on some rule involving the objects on it.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: only object 3\n- Machine: off\n\nImportant: The machine can be on or off depending on the set of objects on it.\n\nNow, let's go through each action and the machine's response:\n\n1. > put object 2 on the machine\n   - Objects on machine: 3, 2\n   - Machine: off\n\n2. > put object 4 on the machine\n   - Objects on machine: 3, 2, 4\n   - Machine turns on.\n\n3. > take object 2 off the machine\n   - Objects on machine: 3, 4\n   - Machine remains on.\n\n4. > take object 3 off the machine\n   - Objects on machine: 4\n   - Machine remains on.\n\n5. > take object 4 off the machine\n   - Objects on machine: none\n   - Machine turns off.\n\nThis suggests that having only object 4 on the machine kept it on, but when we remove object 4, it turns off. Also, note that when we had objects 3 and 2 and 4 together, it turned on. But then removing 2 and 3 left only 4 and it stayed on. Then removing 4 turned it off.\n\nSo object 4 seems to be a blicket because when it's alone on the machine, the machine is on. Also, when we added it in step 2 (with 3 and 2 already on) it turned the machine on.\n\nNow, let's continue:\n\n6. > put object 7 on the machine\n   - Objects: 7\n   - Machine: off\n\n7. > put object 1 on the machine\n   - Objects: 7, 1\n   - Machine: off\n\n8. > put object 6 on the machine\n   - Objects: 7, 1, 6\n   - Machine: off\n\n9. > put object 5 on the machine\n   - Objects: 7, 1, 6, 5\n   - Machine turns on.\n\nSo adding object 5 to {7,1,6} turned the machine on. This suggests that object 5 might be a blicket.\n\n10. > put object 3 on the machine\n    - Objects: 7,1,6,5,3\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n11. > take object 3 off the machine\n    - Objects: 7,1,6,5\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n12. > take object 6 off the machine\n    - Objects: 7,1,5\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n13. > put object 4 on the machine\n    - Objects: 7,1,5,4\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n14. > put object 0 on the machine\n    - Objects: 7,1,5,4,0\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n15. > take object 7 off the machine\n    - Objects: 1,5,4,0\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n16. > take object 1 off the machine\n    - Objects: 5,4,0\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n17. > take object 4 off the machine\n    - Objects: 5,0\n    - Machine remains on.\n\n18. > take object 5 off the machine\n    - Objects: 0\n    - Machine turns off.\n\nNow, note that after removing object 5, only object 0 is left and the machine turns off. Also, when we had objects 5 and 0, the machine was on. Then removing 5 left only 0 and it turned off.\n\nThis suggests that object 5 is a blicket because when it's present (even with 0) the machine is on, but when removed (leaving 0) it turns off. Also, object 0 alone cannot keep the machine on.\n\nBut what about object 0? When we put it on (step 14) with others, it didn't turn off, but when alone it is off. So object 0 might not be a blicket.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the first part: object 4 alone keeps the machine on (step 4: only object 4 -> machine on). And when we remove it (step 5) it turns off. So object 4 is a blicket.\n\nNow, what about object 5?
