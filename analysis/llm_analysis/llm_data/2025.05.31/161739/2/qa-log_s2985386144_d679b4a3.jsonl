A blicket is defined as an object whose state (on machine or not) is not independent of the machine state (i.e., it has an effect on the machine).\n\nLet's analyze the machine's behavior:\n\n- Initially: objects 0,1,4 on -> machine on.\n- After removing 4: objects 0,1 -> machine on.\n- After removing 1: only 0 -> machine on.\n- Then we put 1 back: 0,1 -> machine on.\n- Then remove 0: only 1 -> machine off.\n\nThis suggests that when only object 0 is on the machine (step 2: only 0 -> machine on) and when only object 1 is on the machine (step 4: only 1 -> machine off) we see a difference. Therefore, object 0 seems to be able to turn the machine on by itself? But let's check further.\n\nHowever, note that when we have only object 0: machine is on. When we remove 0 and leave only 1: machine turns off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket (because when it was present the machine was on, and when it was removed the machine turned off) but note that in step 4 we removed object 0 and the machine turned off. However, at that point we had only object 1 on the machine. So the machine turned off because we removed object 0? Or because we left only object 1?\n\nBut let's also see step 5: we put object 2 on the machine (so now objects 1 and 2 are on) and the machine turns on. Then step 6: we add 7 (objects 1,2,7) and it stays on. Then step 7: we remove object 2 and the machine turns off. This suggests that when object 2 is present (with 1 and 7) the machine is on, but without it (only 1 and 7) the machine is off.\n\nNow, we also see that when we tried putting objects 3,5,6,4 on the machine (with 1,7 already on) the machine remained off. So none of these (3,5,6,4) turned the machine on when added to 1 and 7.\n\nBut note: initially we had 0,1,4 and the machine was on. Then when we removed 4, it stayed on. Then we removed 1 and left 0, and it was still on. Then we put 1 back and it was on. Then we removed 0 and left 1, and it turned off. This suggests that object 0 is necessary for the machine to be on in that configuration? But then in step 5, we put object 2 on (with 1) and it turned on.

Initial state: objects 0,1,4 on machine -> machine on.\n\n 2. > take object 4 off the machine\n    Result: machine remains on.\n    So without object 4, machine is still on. This suggests that object 4 might not be necessary for the machine to be on? But note: we still have 0 and 1.\n\n 3. > take object 1 off the machine\n    Result: machine remains on.\n    Now only object 0 is on the machine. So the machine is on with only object 0? This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket and that the machine can be on with just one blicket? Or perhaps there are multiple blickets and we only need one?\n\n 4. > put object 1 on the machine\n    Result: machine remains on. (It was already on, so no change.)\n\n 5. > take object 0 off the machine\n    Result: machine turns off.\n    This is critical. When we remove object 0, the machine turns off even though object 1 is still on. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket and that object 1 might not be? But note: in step 3 when we had only object 0, the machine was on. Then we put object 1 back and it was still on. Then removing object 0 caused the machine to turn off. So object 1 by itself (without object 0) does not keep the machine on? But in step 3, when we took object 1 off and left object 0, the machine stayed on. So object 0 alone can keep the machine on, but object 1 alone (if we had tried) we haven't seen.\n\n    However, after step 5: \n        Objects on machine: only object 1? Then machine turned off. So object 1 by itself does not turn the machine on? But in step 4 we put object 1 back and the machine was on? Wait, at that time object 0 was also there. So the machine was on because of object 0? And when we remove object 0, even with object 1 present, the machine turns off.\n\n    This suggests that object 0 is a blicket and object 1 is not. But what about object 4? We took it off and the machine remained on (when both 0 and 1 were there). Then we took object 1 off and the machine remained on (only 0). Then we put 1 back and it remained on. Then removing 0 turned it off. So object 4 might not be a blicket? Or maybe it is but not necessary when 0 is present.\n\n 6. > put object 2 on the machine\n    Result: machine turns on.\n    Now, at this point, the machine was off (only object 1 was on the machine). Then we put object 2 on and the machine turned on. So object 2 must be a blicket? Because adding it made the machine turn on.\n\n 7. > put object 7 on the machine\n    Result: machine remains on.\n    This doesn't tell us much about object 7 because the machine was already on.\n\n 8. > take object 2 off the machine\n    Result: machine turns off.\n    So removing object 2 caused the machine to turn off. This confirms that object 2 is a blicket? Because without it (and with object 1 and 7 still on) the machine turned off. But note: we don't know about object 1 and 7. However, we know from step 5 that object 1 alone does not keep the machine on. Now we have object 1 and 7 on the machine and the machine turns off? So it appears that neither object 1 nor object 7 are blickets? Or maybe we need at least one blicket? And when we removed object 2 (the blicket) the machine turned off.\n\n 9. > put object 3 on the machine\n    Result: machine remains off.\n    So we added object 3 and the machine did not turn on. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket?

We note the state of the machine (on/off) after each action.\n\n Let's list the actions and the machine state after:\n\n Initial state: \n   Machine: [0,1,4] are on, machine is ON.\n\n Action 1: take object 4 off -> machine remains ON.\n   Now on machine: [0,1] -> machine ON.\n\n Action 2: take object 1 off -> machine remains ON.\n   Now on machine: [0] -> machine ON.\n\n Action 3: put object 1 on -> machine remains ON.\n   Now on machine: [0,1] -> machine ON.\n\n Action 4: take object 0 off -> machine turns OFF.\n   Now on machine: [1] -> machine OFF.\n\n   This is interesting: when only object 1 is on the machine, the machine turns off? \n   But note: in action 2 we had only object 0 and the machine was ON? \n   Wait, let's check:\n\n   After action 2: we took object1 off, leaving object0 -> machine was ON.\n   Then we put object1 back (action3) -> machine ON (so [0,1] ON).\n   Then we take object0 off -> leaving object1 alone -> machine OFF.\n\n   So why was object0 alone ON but object1 alone OFF? \n   This suggests that object0 is a blicket and object1 is not? \n   But wait: what if the rule is more complex?\n\n Action 5: put object2 on -> machine turns ON.\n   Now on machine: [1,2] -> machine ON.\n\n   Previously with only object1 (non-blicket?) the machine was off. Now adding object2 turns it on.\n   So object2 must be a blicket? \n\n Action 6: put object7 on -> machine remains ON.\n   Now on machine: [1,2,7] -> machine ON.\n\n Action 7: take object2 off -> machine turns OFF.\n   Now on machine: [1,7] -> machine OFF.\n\n   This is key: removing object2 (which we just saw turning the machine on) causes the machine to turn off, even though object7 is still there.\n\n Action 8: put object3 on -> machine remains OFF.\n   Now on machine: [1,7,3] -> OFF.\n\n Action 9: put object5 on -> remains OFF.\n   Now on machine: [1,7,3,5] -> OFF.\n\n Action 10: put object6 on -> remains OFF.\n   Now on machine: [1,7,3,5,6] -> OFF.\n\n Action 11: put object4 on -> remains OFF.\n   Now on machine: [1,7,3,5,6,4] -> OFF.\n\n Observations:\n\n - When only object0 was on (after action2) the machine was ON. So object0 must be a blicket? \n   But then why when we had object1 and object2 together it was ON? And when we remove object2 (a blicket?) the machine turns off.\n\n - After action4: we have only object1 -> machine OFF. So object1 is not a blicket? \n\n - After action5: we put object2 on (with object1) and the machine turns ON. This suggests that object2 is a blicket.\n\n - After action6: we put object7 on (with objects1 and2) and the machine remains ON. But then when we remove object2 (action7), the machine turns off. \n   This suggests that object7 is not sufficient to keep the machine on? And that object2 was the only blicket in that group? \n\n   But note: we have object1 and object7 on the machine after removing object2 -> machine OFF.\n\n - Then we add several other objects (3,5,6,4) and the machine remains OFF. \n\n   This suggests that none of these objects (3,5,6,4) are blickets? \n\n   However, let's check the initial state: we had objects0,1,4 on the machine and the machine was ON. \n   Then we took object4 off (action1) and the machine remained ON. Then we took object1 off (action2) and the machine remained ON (so only object0 left -> ON). \n   Then we put object1 back (action3) and the machine remained ON.
