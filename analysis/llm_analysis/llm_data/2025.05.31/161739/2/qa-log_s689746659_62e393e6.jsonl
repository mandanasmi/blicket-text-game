So, when we added object 0, the machine turned on. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket. However, note that there are already objects 2, 4, and 3 on the machine.

At this point, the only object on the machine is object 1 (which was put in step 8). So if the machine remains on after removing object 0 and leaving object 1, then object 1 must also be a blicket?\n\nBut wait, let's recount the state at step 9:\n- After step 8: objects on machine: 0 and 1 -> machine on.\n- Step 9: remove object 0 -> only object 1 remains -> machine still on.\n\nTherefore, object 1 must be a blicket as well.\n\nThen:\nStep 10: Put object 4 on the machine -> machine remains on (so object 4 is added, but machine was already on because of object 1? Doesn't tell us about object 4).\nStep 11: Put object 2 on the machine -> machine remains on (again, already on).\nStep 12: Put object 6 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n\nNow step 13: Take object 1 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n\nAfter removing object 1, the machine turns off. At this point, the objects on the machine are: object 4, object 2, and object 6 (which were added in steps 10, 11, 12). So if the machine turns off when we remove object 1, that suggests that object 1 was the only blicket on the machine at that moment? And objects 4, 2, and 6 are not blickets?

Let's analyze step by step to infer which objects are blickets and the rule for the machine.\n\nInitial state: All objects on the floor, machine off.\n\nActions and outcomes:\n\n1. Put object 2 on machine -> machine off.\n2. Put object 4 on machine -> machine off.\n3. Put object 3 on machine -> machine off.\n4. Put object 0 on machine -> machine turns on.\n\nSo after adding object 0 to the existing set (objects 2, 4, 3), the machine turns on. This suggests that object 0 is critical because when it was added, the machine turned on.\n\nBut note: when we put object 0 on, the machine turned on. So the set {2,4,3,0} makes the machine on.\n\nNow, the agent starts removing objects:\n\n5. Take object 4 off -> machine remains on.\n6. Take object 3 off -> machine remains on.\n7. Take object 2 off -> machine remains on.\n\nSo now only object 0 is on the machine and the machine is on. This suggests that object 0 alone can turn the machine on? But wait, we had multiple objects when it turned on, so we need to see if the machine stays on when others are removed.\n\nAfter removing 2, 3, and 4, the machine is still on with only object 0. So object 0 is a blicket and it is sufficient to turn the machine on by itself? But let's see more.\n\n8. Put object 1 on the machine -> machine remains on (with objects 0 and 1).\n9. Take object 0 off -> machine remains on (now only object 1?).\n\nWait, after taking object 0 off, the machine is still on. So at this point, only object 1 is on the machine? And the machine is on? That would suggest that object 1 is also a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself? But let's check:\n\n- When object 0 was put on (step 4), it turned the machine on. Then we removed others and left only object 0 -> machine on.\n- Then we put object 1 on -> machine still on (so now we have 0 and 1).\n- Then we remove object 0 -> machine remains on? So if only object 1 is left, and the machine is on, then object 1 is also a blicket.\n\nBut wait, step 9: \"take object 0 off the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So after removing object 0, we have object 1 and possibly others? At step 8, we put object 1 on, so at step 9, we have object 1 and also what? Let's see the state:\n\nAfter step 7: Only object 0 on machine -> machine on.\nStep 8: put object 1 on -> now objects 0 and 1 on machine -> machine on.\nStep 9: take object 0 off -> now only object 1 on machine -> machine remains on.\n\nSo object 1 alone can keep the machine on? Then object 1 must be a blicket.\n\nBut then why didn't the machine turn on when we put object 1? Because we never put object 1 alone until now? Actually, we never put object 1 until step 8. And at step 8, the machine was already on, so we don't know if object 1 alone would turn it on. But after step 9, we see that with only object 1, the machine is on. So object 1 is a blicket.\n\nBut then step 10: put object 4 on the machine -> machine remains on. Now we have object 1 and 4 on the machine.\nStep 11: put object 2 on the machine -> machine remains on. Now objects 1,4,2.\nStep 12: put object 6 on the machine -> machine remains on. Now objects 1,4,2,6.\n\nStep 13: take object 1 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n\nSo when we remove object 1, the machine turns off. This is critical.\n\nAfter removing object 1, the machine turns off. So at that point, we have objects 4,2,6 on the machine. And the machine is off.\n\nThen:\n\n14. Put object 5 on -> machine still off.\n15. Put object 7 on -> machine still off.\n\nSo now we have objects 4,2,6,5,7 on the machine and the machine is off.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\n- When we had only object 1, the machine was on.

But note that when we put object 0 on, the machine turns on. However, there are already objects 2, 4, and 3 on the machine. So it might be that object 0 is a blicket and the machine requires at least one blicket? But then why didn't the machine turn on with any of the previous objects? Unless none of 2,3,4 are blickets? Or perhaps the rule is more complex.\n\n6. Now, we take object 4 off -> machine remains on.\n\n   This tells us that removing object 4 did not turn off the machine. So object 4 might not be necessary for the machine to stay on? Or it might not be a blicket.\n\n7.

Take object 2 off -> machine remains on.\n\n   Removing object 2 also didn't affect the machine.\n\n   So at this point, only object 0 is on the machine and the machine is on.

Take object 0 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n\n    Now, object 0 (which we thought was a blicket) is removed, but the machine is still on? This is surprising. So what is keeping the machine on? Only object 1 is left on the machine.\n\n    Therefore, object 1 must be a blicket? Because when we remove object 0, the machine should have turned off if object 0 was the only blicket, but it didn't. So object 1 must also be a blicket.\n\n    However, note that when we put object 1 on the machine (step 9) the machine was already on (because of object 0). So we didn't see if putting object 1 alone would turn the machine on.\n\n    But in step 10, when we remove object 0 and leave object 1, the machine remains on. So object 1 must be a blicket.\n\n11. Put object 4 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n\n    We already have object 1 and now add object 4. The machine stays on.\n\n12. Put object 2 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n\n    Now we have objects 1, 4, 2 on the machine and the machine is on.\n\n13.

Because removing it caused the machine to turn off even though there are other objects (4,2,6) on the machine.\n\n    Therefore, objects 4,2,6 are not blickets?

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object that has a non-independent relationship with the machine's state (i.e., the presence of the blicket on the machine affects whether the machine turns on).\n\nWe have 8 objects (0 to 7).

Because when we remove it, the machine turns off even though 4, 2, and 6 are still on. Therefore, objects 4, 2, and 6 might not be blickets.\n\n    But note: earlier when we had only object 0, the machine was on. Then we added object 1 and removed object 0 and the machine stayed on. Then we added non-blickets? Then when we remove object 1, the machine turns off.\n\n    So object 1 is a blicket and objects 2, 4, and 6 are not? But what about object 0? We saw that object 0 turned the machine on and when it was alone the machine stayed on until we removed it? Actually, when we removed object 0 (step 9) and left only object 1, the machine stayed on. Then we added non-blickets and then removed object 1 and the machine turned off.\n\n14. Then we put object 5 -> machine off (so doesn't turn on by itself or with the current set: 4,2,6,5? but note the machine was off and putting 5 didn't turn it on).\n15. put object 7 -> machine remains off.\n\n    So adding 5 and 7 to the machine (which already has 4,2,6) doesn't turn it on.\n\nNow, what have we learned?\n\n- When we first put object 0 on (with 2,3,4 already on) the machine turned on. Then we removed 2,3,4 and it stayed on. Then we removed 0 and it stayed on (because 1 was there).

A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine.\n\nWe need to infer the rule that turns the machine on. The machine turns on when certain objects are on it. We have 8 objects (0 to 7) and the machine.\n\nLet's analyze the interactions step by step:\n\n1. Initially, all objects are on the floor, machine is off.\n\n2. > put object 2 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n3. > put object 4 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n4. > put object 3 on the machine -> machine remains off.\n5. > put object 0 on the machine -> machine turns on.\n\n   So, after putting object 0 on, the machine turns on. This suggests that object 0 might be a blicket, but note that there are other objects on the machine (2, 4, 3) and adding 0 made it turn on. So the rule might require object 0 to be present? Or perhaps a combination?\n\n6. > take object 4 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n7. > take object 3 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n8. > take object 2 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n\n   Even after removing 4, 3, and 2, the machine stays on. The only object left on the machine is object 0. So if the machine is still on with only object 0, that suggests that object 0 alone can turn on the machine? But note that when we put object 0 on, there were already other objects (2,4,3) and then it turned on. However, after removing all others, it remains on. So object 0 by itself is enough to keep the machine on? Or is there a rule that once on, it stays on? But note step 13: when we take off object 1, the machine turns off.\n\n   Let's continue:\n\n9. > put object 1 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n10. > take object 0 off the machine -> machine remains on.\n\n    Now, after removing object 0, the machine is still on. But note that at this point, object 1 is on the machine. So if the machine remains on without object 0, then object 0 might not be the only blicket? Or perhaps the machine stays on as long as at least one blicket is present? But then why did it turn on when we added object 0? Because at that time, we added object 0 to the existing set (which didn't have a blicket) and then it turned on? That suggests that object 0 is a blicket and the others are not.\n\n    However, after step 10, we have only object 1 on the machine and the machine is on. So object 1 must be a blicket? But then why didn't the machine turn on when we put object 1 on in step 9? Actually, step 9: when we put object 1 on, the machine was already on (from having object 0 and then we added 1) and then we removed 0 and it stayed on? That is consistent: object 1 is also a blicket.\n\n    But wait, step 5: when we put object 0 on, it turned on. Then we removed 2,3,4 and it stayed on (so object 0 is a blicket). Then we added object 1 (step 9) and the machine was on. Then we removed object 0 (step 10) and the machine stayed on. That suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n\n11. > put object 4 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n12. > put object 2 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n13. > put object 6 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n\n    Then step 14: > take object 1 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n\n    So when we remove object 1, the machine turns off. At that point, the objects on the machine are 4, 2, and 6. And the machine turns off. This suggests that object 1 was the only blicket on the machine at that moment? Because after removing it, the machine turned off even though 4,2,6 were still on.\n\n    But note: when we had only object 0 on the machine (step 8) the machine was on. Then we added object 1 (step 9) and then removed object 0 (step 10) and the machine stayed on (so object 1 alone kept it on). Then we added 4,2,6 and then removed object 1 and the machine turned off.
