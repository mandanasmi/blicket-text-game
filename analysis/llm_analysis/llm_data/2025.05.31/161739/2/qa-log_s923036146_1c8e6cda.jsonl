We must infer the rule that makes the machine turn on. The rule is hidden and we have to deduce it from the interactions.\n 2.

So object 1 might be a blicket. But note that initially with only object 3 (which was on the machine) the light was off. Then adding 6 didn't turn it on, but adding 1 did.\n\n3. > take object 3 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: 6, 1\n   - Light remains on.\n\n   This is interesting: even after removing object 3, the light stays on. So object 3 might not be necessary for the machine to stay on? But note the machine was on when we removed it and remained on.\n\n4. > take object 6 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: only object 1\n   - Light remains on.\n\n   Now we have only object 1 on the machine and the light is on. This suggests that object 1 alone can turn the machine on? But wait, when we put object 1 on (step 2) it turned the machine on when there were already 3 and 6. Now we see that with only object 1, the light is on. So object 1 is a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself? However, note that the machine was already on when we removed 6, so we don't know if it would turn on if we started with only 1.\n\n   But let's see the next step.\n\n5. > put object 0 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 1, 0\n   - Light remains on.\n\n   This doesn't tell us much because the machine was already on.\n\n6. > take object 1 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: only object 0\n   - Light turns off.\n\n   This is critical: when we remove object 1, the light turns off even though object 0 is still on the machine. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket (or at least not sufficient to keep the machine on). And object 1 is necessary to keep the machine on? But note that when we had only object 1, the machine was on. Now with only object 0, it's off. So object 1 is a blicket and object 0 is not.\n\n7. > put object 2 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 0, 2\n   - Light remains off.\n\n   So with objects 0 and 2, the machine is off. Since we suspect object 0 is not a blicket, and object 2 alone (or in combination with 0) doesn't turn it on.\n\n8. > put object 4 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 0, 2, 4\n   - Light remains off.\n\n   Adding 4 doesn't help.\n\n9. > put object 7 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 0, 2, 4, 7\n   - Light turns on.\n\n   So adding object 7 caused the machine to turn on.

But note that it might be that the rule is more complex.\n\nAction 3: take object 3 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [6,1]\n- Machine: remains on\n\nSo, removing object 3 (which was initially on the machine) does not turn the machine off. Therefore, object 3 might not be necessary for the machine to stay on? Or the rule might be that the machine is on as long as at least one blicket is on? But wait, initially with only object 3 (a blicket?) the machine was off? Let's recall the initial state: object 3 was on the machine and the machine was off. So object 3 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\nAction 4: take object 6 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [1]\n- Machine: remains on\n\nSo with only object 1 on the machine, the machine is on. This suggests that object 1 is a blicket and can turn the machine on by itself.\n\nAction 5: put object 0 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [1,0]\n- Machine: remains on\n\nAdding object 0 doesn't change the state (remains on). But we don't know if object 0 is a blicket because the machine was already on.\n\nAction 6: take object 1 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [0]\n- Machine: turns off\n\nSo with only object 0 on the machine, the machine turns off. Therefore, object 0 is not a blicket (because it cannot keep the machine on by itself). Also, note that removing object 1 (a blicket) turned the machine off. This confirms that object 1 is necessary at that point? But wait, the machine turned off when we removed object 1 and left only object 0. So object 0 is not a blicket.\n\nAction 7: put object 2 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [0,2]\n- Machine: off\n\nAction 8: put object 4 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [0,2,4]\n- Machine: off\n\nAction 9: put object 7 on the machine\n- Now on machine: [0,2,4,7]\n- Machine: turns on\n\nSo adding object 7 turned the machine on. Therefore, object 7 is a blicket? But note that the machine turned on when we added object 7 to [0,2,4]. So at least one of [0,2,4,7] must be a blicket. However, we already know object 0 is not a blicket (from when it was alone and the machine turned off). So the blicket must be among 2,4,7? But we don't know which.\n\nAction 10: take object 2 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [0,4,7]\n- Machine: remains on\n\nSo removing object 2 doesn't turn the machine off. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket? Because if it were, then removing it might turn the machine off? But note: the machine remained on, so the blicket must still be present. Since object 0 is not a blicket, then either object 4 or object 7 (or both) must be blickets.\n\nAction 11: put object 2 back on the machine\n- Now on machine: [0,4,7,2]\n- Machine: remains on\n\nNo change.\n\nAction 12: take object 2 off the machine\n- Now on machine: [0,4,7]\n- Machine: remains on\n\nAgain, no change.

Then removing 3 (step3) left {6,1} and the machine stayed on. Then removing 6 (step4) left only 1 and the machine stayed on. Then we added 0 (step5) and the machine stayed on. Then removing 1 (step6) left only 0 and the machine turned off.\n\n This suggests that object 1 is a blicket and that 0 is not. Also, when we had only 1, the machine was on, so the rule might be that having at least one blicket on the machine turns it on? But then step 7-8: with 0 and 2 and 4 (which we suspect are not blickets) the machine is off. Then adding 7 (step9) turns it on. So 7 must be a blicket.\n\n Also, in step 16: when we remove 7, the machine turns off, even though we have 0,4,3,2,5 on the machine. This suggests that 7 was the only blicket among those on the machine at that time? But wait, we also have object 3 on the machine.
