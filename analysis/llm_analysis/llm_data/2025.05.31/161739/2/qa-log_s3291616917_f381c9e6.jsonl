We need to determine which objects are blickets and what the rule is for the machine turning on.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object whose state (on machine or not) is not independent of the state of the machine (i.e., it has a causal relationship with the machine).\n\nWe have 8 objects (0 to 7). Initially:\n- Object 3 is on the machine, others on the floor. Machine light is off.\n\nNow, let's go step by step:\n\n1. > put object 2 on the machine\n   Result: Machine turns on.\n   Before: Objects on machine: only 3 (and machine was off). Now adding 2: machine turns on.\n   So: With 3 alone, machine was off. After adding 2, machine on. This suggests that having both 2 and 3 might be important? Or maybe 2 is a blicket and 3 is not? But note initially 3 was on and machine was off.\n\n2. > take object 3 off the machine\n   Result: Machine remains on.\n   Now: Objects on machine: only 2. Machine is on. So with only 2, machine is on. This suggests that object 2 alone can turn the machine on? But then why was the machine off initially with only 3? So perhaps 2 is a blicket and 3 is not.\n\n3. > put object 0 on the machine\n   Result: Machine remains on.\n   Now: Objects on machine: 2 and 0. Machine on. This doesn't tell us much about 0 because the machine was already on.\n\n4. > take object 2 off the machine\n   Result: Machine turns off.\n   Now: Only object 0 is on the machine. Machine turns off. This suggests that object 0 alone does not keep the machine on? But note that when we had only 2, the machine was on. So object 2 is critical? Or maybe the rule is that the machine is on only if at least one blicket is on? Then 2 would be a blicket and 0 is not.\n\n   However, we then put 0 and 2 together and the machine was on. Then removing 2 (leaving 0) turned it off. So 0 alone doesn't turn it on.\n\n5. > put object 7 on the machine\n   Result: Machine remains off.\n   Now: Objects: 0 and 7. Machine off. So adding 7 to 0 didn't turn it on.\n\n6. > put object 5 on the machine\n   Result: Machine remains off.\n   Now: Objects: 0, 7, 5. Still off.\n\n7. > put object 4 on the machine\n   Result: Machine turns on.\n   Now: Objects: 0, 7, 5, and 4. Machine on. So adding 4 turned it on. This suggests that 4 is a blicket? Because when we added 4, the machine turned on.\n\n   But note: when we had only 0, 7, 5 (non-blickets?) and then adding 4 turned it on. So 4 must be a blicket.\n\n8. > put object 2 on the machine\n   Result: Machine turns on (it was already on? But note step 7 turned it on, and now we add 2. The message says \"now on\", meaning it remains on? But it was already on. So no change? But then why say \"now on\"? Actually, the message is consistent: it was on and remains on.\n\n   However, note that step 7: machine was off, then we put 4 and it turned on. Then we put 2 (which we suspect is a blicket) and it remains on.\n\n9. > take object 4 off the machine\n   Result: Machine remains on.\n   Now: Objects: 0, 7, 5, and 2 (and 4 removed). Machine remains on. So without 4, but with 2 (and others) the machine is still on. This suggests that 2 is also a blicket? Because we removed 4 (a blicket) but the machine stayed on, meaning there is at least one other blicket present (which must be 2, since 0,7,5 were present when machine was off without 4 or 2).\n\n10. > put object 3 on the machine\n    Result: Machine remains on.\n    Now: Adding 3 to the mix. Doesn't change.\n\n11. > take object 0 off the machine\n    Result: Machine remains on.\n    Now: Removing 0. Machine still on. So 0 is not necessary?

So object 3 alone does not turn on the machine? But note:\n   After step 1: when we put object 2 on (with 3 already on) the machine turns on. Then when we remove 3 (step 2), leaving only 2, the machine remains on.\n\n   However, in step 4: when we remove object 2 (leaving only object 0) the machine turns off. Then we add 7 and 5 and the machine remains off until we add 4 (step 7) and then it turns on.\n\n - Step 7: when we put object 4 on (with 0,7,5 already on) the machine turns on. Then we add 2 (step 8) and it remains on. Then we remove 4 (step 9) and the machine remains on? So 4 might be important.\n\n - Step 13: when we remove object 2 (leaving 7,5,3,1) the machine turns off. Then adding 6 doesn't turn it on.\n\n We suspect that the machine turns on if and only if at least one blicket is on the machine? But note:\n\n   In step 4: only object 0 is on the machine and the machine is off. So if object 0 is a blicket, then the machine should be on? Unless object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the rule is more complex.\n\n Let's try to figure out which objects are blickets by looking at when the machine changes state.\n\n We note that the machine changes state (on/off) when an object is added or removed. We can look at the state before and after the action.\n\n Steps where the machine changes:\n\n   Step 1: put 2 -> machine turns on (from off to on). So adding 2 caused the machine to turn on.

This is interesting because we just saw that adding 4 turned the machine on (when the machine was off). Now when we remove 4, the machine remains on? So perhaps object 4 is not the only blicket?

In other words, the object has some influence on the machine.\n\n We must infer the rule for the machine turning on.\n\n Let's break down the interactions step by step to see when the machine turns on and off, and which objects are involved.\n\n Initial state:\n   Objects on machine: only object 3 (since object 3 is on top at start, and others on floor)\n   Machine light: off\n\n Action 1: put object 2 on the machine -> machine turns on.\n   Now on machine: object 3 (already there) and object 2.\n   So with objects 2 and 3, machine is on.\n\n Action 2: take object 3 off -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: only object 2.\n   So with only object 2, machine is on.\n\n Action 3: put object 0 on the machine -> machine remains on.\n   Now on machine: object 2 and object 0.\n\n Action 4: take object 2 off -> machine turns off.\n   Now on machine: only object 0 -> and machine turns off.\n\n This suggests that object 0 alone is not enough to keep the machine on? But note: when we had only object 2, the machine was on. So object 2 is a blicket? But then when we remove object 2 and leave object 0, it turns off. So object 0 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\n However, let's see what happens when we put object 0 alone? We never see that until this point. Actually, when we put object 0 (action 3) we already had object 2 on the machine. So the machine was on with object 2 and then adding 0 kept it on. Then removing 2 (leaving only 0) turned it off.\n\n So at this point, we know:\n   Object 2 alone: machine on -> so object 2 is a blicket.\n   Object 0 alone: machine off -> so object 0 is not a blicket? But note: the definition says the object's state is not independent. However, if the machine only turns on when a blicket is present, then having a non-blicket alone would not turn it on.\n\n But wait: what if the rule is more complex? Maybe it requires at least one blicket? Then having any blicket would turn it on.\n\n Now, action 5: put object 7 on the machine -> machine remains off (light is currently off after taking object 2 off, which left only object 0, and now we put 7 on top of 0). So now we have objects 0 and 7 -> machine off.\n\n Action 6: put object 5 on the machine -> machine remains off. Now we have objects 0,7,5 -> machine off.\n\n Action 7: put object 4 on the machine -> machine turns on. Now we have objects 0,7,5,4 -> machine on.\n\n What changed? We added object 4. So object 4 must be a blicket? Because when we added it, the machine turned on.\n\n Action 8: put object 2 on the machine (again) -> machine remains on (it was already on). Now we have objects 0,7,5,4,2.\n\n Action 9: take object 4 off -> machine remains on. Now we have objects 0,7,5,2.\n\n Action 10: put object 3 on the machine -> machine remains on. Now we have objects 0,7,5,2,3.\n\n Action 11: take object 0 off -> machine remains on. Now we have objects 7,5,2,3.\n\n Action 12: put object 1 on the machine -> machine remains on. Now we have objects 7,5,2,3,1.\n\n Action 13: take object 2 off -> machine turns off. Now we have objects 7,5,3,1.\n\n Action 14: put object 6 on the machine -> machine remains off. Now we have objects 7,5,3,1,6.\n\n Let's summarize the states when the machine is on and off:\n\n On: \n   - Initially: off (only object 3 on machine? but at start machine is off -> so object 3 alone is not enough? Wait, initial state: machine off with object 3 on it. Then when we put object 2, it turned on. So object 3 alone was not turning it on? But then after we put 2, it turned on. Then we removed 3 and it stayed on?
