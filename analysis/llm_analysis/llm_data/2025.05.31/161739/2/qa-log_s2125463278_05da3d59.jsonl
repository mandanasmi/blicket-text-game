Put object 7 -> machine turns ON.\n\nAt this point, the machine turns on when object 7 is placed on the machine. But note that before putting 7, the machine had objects 0,1,3,4,5,6 on it (since 2 was taken off). So the set on the machine was {0,1,3,4,5,6} and then adding 7 turned it on.\n\nBut then:\n\n10. Take object 1 off -> machine turns off.\n    So when we remove object 1, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 1 is necessary for the machine to be on? But wait, when we put 7 the machine turned on and at that time object 1 was present. Then removing 1 turned it off.\n\n11. Take object 6 off -> machine remains off (since it was already off).\n12. Put object 1 back -> machine turns on again.\n\n    So putting object 1 back turns the machine on. Now the machine has objects 0,3,4,5,7 and now 1. So the set is {0,1,3,4,5,7} and the machine is on.\n\n13. Take object 0 off -> machine remains on? The history says: \"You took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" -> so it stays on.\n\n14. Take object 4 off -> machine remains on.\n15. Take object 5 off -> machine remains on.\n16. Take object 3 off -> machine remains on.\n\nAfter removing 0,4,5,3, the machine is still on. What remains on the machine? Only object 1 and 7.\n\nTherefore, the machine is on when both object 1 and object 7 are on the machine.\n\nBut let's check the initial turning on event:\n\n- When the machine turned on (after putting 7): the objects were {0,1,3,4,5,6,7}. Then we removed 1 and it turned off. Then we put 1 back and it turned on.\n\nAlso, when we had {1,7} the machine was on (after removing others).\n\nBut note: when we put 7 and the machine turned on, we had many objects including 1. Then when we removed 1, it turned off. Then when we put 1 back (with 7 still there) it turned on. Then we removed 0,4,5,3 and the machine stayed on. So it seems that having both 1 and 7 is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\nBut what about object 7 alone? We don't have a test of object 7 alone. However, note that when we first put objects 1,4,3,5,0,6,2 individually, the machine did not turn on. And putting 2 and then taking it off didn't change. Then when we added 7 (to the existing set) it turned on. But that set included 1. So we cannot say that 7 alone is a blicket.\n\nSimilarly, when we have only 1 and 7, the machine is on. So the rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 7 are on the machine.\n\nNow, what about the other objects? They don't seem to matter because we can remove them and the machine stays on as long as 1 and 7 are present.\n\nAlso, note that when we had the set without 1 (after taking 1 off) the machine turned off even though 7 was still there. Then when we put 1 back, it turned on. So both are necessary.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: The machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 7 are on the machine.\n\nNow, the question: is object 0 a blicket?\n\nA blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine.

Take object 3 off -> machine remains on? Wait, the log says: \"The light on the machine is now on.\" for every removal until the last one? Actually, the log says:\n\nAfter taking 1 off (step 10): machine off.\nAfter taking 6 off (step 11): machine off.\nAfter putting 1 back (step 12): machine on.\nThen, for each removal of 0,4,5,3, the log says \"the light on the machine is now on\". This is confusing because we are removing objects and the machine remains on? But note the log says \"now on\" meaning it is still on? Or does it mean it turned on at that moment? Let me re-read:\n\n> take object 0 off the machine\nYou took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. How can taking an object off make the machine turn on? Unless there's a misinterpretation.\n\nActually, looking back at the log:\n\nAfter step 12: \"put object 1 on the machine\" -> \"the light on the machine is now on.\"\n\nThen step 13: \"take object 0 off the machine\" -> \"the light on the machine is now on.\" This must mean that the machine was on and remains on? Because if it was already on, then removing object 0 doesn't change it? But the phrasing is \"is now on\" which could be interpreted as the current state after the action.\n\nSimilarly, step 14: take object 4 off -> \"the light on the machine is now on.\"\nStep 15: take object 5 off -> \"now on\"\nStep 16: take object 3 off -> \"now on\"\n\nSo the machine remains on during these removals? That suggests that the machine is not turning off when we remove these objects.\n\nBut at step 10, when we removed object 1, the machine turned off. Then when we put object 1 back, it turned on. And then we removed others and it stayed on.\n\nTherefore, object 1 seems to be critical. Also, note that when we added object 7 (step 9) the machine turned on.

The history says: \"You took object 6 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\" So it was off and remains off.\n\n11. Put object 1 back on -> machine turns on.\n    So, putting 1 back on (with 4,3,5,0,7 still on? and 6 and 2 are off) turns the machine on.\n\n    At this point, the objects on the machine are: 1,4,3,5,0,7 (since 6 was taken off and 2 was already off). So when we put 1 back, the machine turns on.\n\n12. Then, we remove object 0: machine remains on? The history says: \"You took object 0 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So it stays on.\n\n13. Remove object 4: machine remains on? \"You took object 4 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So still on.\n\n14.

Remove object 3: machine remains on? \"You took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\" So still on.\n\nNow, after removing object 3, the machine is still on. What objects are left on the machine? We started with 1,4,3,5,0,7. Then we removed 0,4,5,3. So only objects 1 and 7 are on the machine?

We need to figure out which objects are blickets and what rule causes the machine to turn on.\n\nRecall: A blicket is an object that has a non-independent relationship with the machine (i.e., its presence affects whether the machine turns on).\n\nLet's list the actions and the state of the machine:\n\nInitial state: All objects on the floor.

Actually, the text says \"currently off\" after both actions 10 and 11).\nAction 12: Put object 1 back on -> machine turns on.\n\nSo after removing 1 and 6 (leaving {0,3,4,5,7} on the machine) the machine is off. Then putting 1 back on (so now {0,1,3,4,5,7}) turns the machine on.\n\nAction 13: Take object 0 off -> machine remains on? Actually, it says \"now on\" meaning it was on and remains on?

Text: \"The light on the machine is now on.\" -> meaning it is still on.\nAction 15: Take object 5 off -> machine remains on.\nAction 16: Take object 3 off -> machine remains on.\n\nSo after action 16, we have only objects 1 and 7 on the machine? Because we started at the point when we had {0,1,3,4,5,7} (after putting 1 back) and then we removed 0,4,5,3. So we are left with {1,7}. And the machine is on.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the rule.\n\nFrom the first time the machine turned on (action 9): we had objects {0,1,3,4,5,6,7} on the machine. But then when we removed 1 and 6 (action 10 and 11), the machine turned off. Then putting 1 back (without 6) turned it on again.

So the machine remained on even when we removed those. This suggests that the machine does not require all of those to be present. Only 1 and 7 are present at the end and the machine is on.\n\nMoreover, when we put 7 on (action 9) and the machine turned on, we had many objects. But then when we removed 1 (action 10) the machine turned off. So 1 must be necessary at that time? But note that when we put 1 back (action 12) the machine turned on again.\n\nBut also, when we removed 1 and 6, the machine turned off. Then putting 1 back (without 6) turned it on. So 6 doesn't seem to be necessary? Because when we had 1 and 7 (and others) without 6, it was on.\n\nWait, at the end we have only 1 and 7 and the machine is on.\n\nSo what about object 7?

(Now on machine: 0,1,3,4,5,6,7)\n\nAt this point, we have 7 objects on the machine (0,1,3,4,5,6,7) and the machine turns on. Previously, with 7 objects (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) the machine was off. The only difference is that we replaced object 2 with object 7. This suggests that object 7 might be a blicket and object 2 might not be (or at least the presence of 7 is critical).\n\nBut let's continue:\n\n10. Take object 1 off -> machine off.

Take object 3 off -> machine remains ON. (Now on machine: 1,7)\n\nWait, after taking object 3 off, the machine is still on? But we only have objects 1 and 7 on the machine.\n\nLet's recap the states when the machine is on:\n\n- After step 9: objects 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 -> machine on. Then we remove one by one until only 1 and 7 remain and the machine is still on.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal set that turns the machine on. Notice that when we had objects 1 and 7 on the machine (after step 16), the machine was on. Also, when we put object 1 back in step 12 (with objects 0,3,4,5,7) the machine turned on, but then removing 0,4,5,3 didn't turn it off. So the critical objects must be 1 and 7.\n\nBut let's check when the machine turned on for the first time: step 9, when we added object 7 to the existing set (which included 0,1,3,4,5,6). So the set without 2 but with 7 turned it on. Then, when we removed 1 and 6, the machine turned off. Then putting 1 back turned it on. So object 1 and 7 together seem to be the key.\n\nMoreover, in the end, we have only 1 and 7 on the machine and the machine is on. So the rule might be that the machine turns on if and only if both object 1 and object 7 are on the machine.\n\nBut what about the other objects? In step 9, we had 7 objects and it turned on, but then we removed objects and the machine stayed on until we broke the set? Actually, after step 9, we removed object 1 and the machine turned off. Then we removed object 6 (which was on the machine) and it remained off. Then we put object 1 back and it turned on. Then we removed several others and it remained on until we were left with only 1 and 7.\n\nSo the machine turns on if both 1 and 7 are present, regardless of the others?

But note that when we had all 7 objects (including 1) it was on, and removing 1 made it off.\n\n12. Then removes object 6: machine remains OFF.\n    - Now: 4,3,5,0,7 -> OFF.\n\n13. Then puts object 1 back: machine turns ON.\n    - Now: 4,3,5,0,7,1 -> ON.\n\n    So without object 6, but with objects 1 and the others (4,3,5,0,7) the machine turns on.\n\n14. Then removes object 0: machine remains ON.\n    - Now: 4,3,5,7,1 -> ON.\n\n15. Then removes object 4: machine remains ON.\n    - Now: 3,5,7,1 -> ON.\n\n16. Then removes object 5: machine remains ON.\n    - Now: 3,7,1 -> ON.\n\n17. Then removes object 3: machine remains ON?\n    - Actually, the last step: \"take object 3 off the machine\" and the machine is still on? \n      The history says: \"The light on the machine is now on.\" for each removal until the last one.\n\n    But note: after removing object 3, the machine has only objects 7 and 1? \n    Because we had: 3,7,1 -> ON, then remove 3: leaving 7 and 1 -> and the machine is still on.\n\n    However, let's check the sequence:\n\n    After step 13: objects on machine: 4,3,5,0,7,1 -> ON.\n\n    Step 14: remove 0 -> objects: 4,3,5,7,1 -> ON.\n    Step 15: remove 4 -> objects: 3,5,7,1 -> ON.\n    Step 16: remove 5 -> objects: 3,7,1 -> ON.\n    Step 17: remove 3 -> objects: 7,1 -> ON.\n\n    So with only objects 7 and 1, the machine is ON.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the rule:\n\nFrom the above, we have:\n\n- When object 7 was added to the set {1,4,3,5,0,6}, the machine turned on.

We need to determine if object 7 is a blicket.\n A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine.\n\n Let's analyze the interactions step by step:\n\n Initial state: All objects on the floor, machine off.\n\n Actions and results:\n\n 1. Put object 1 on machine -> machine remains off.\n 2. Put object 4 on machine -> machine remains off.\n 3. Put object 3 on machine -> machine remains off.\n 4. Put object 5 on machine -> machine remains off.\n 5. Put object 0 on machine -> machine remains off.\n 6. Put object 6 on machine -> machine remains off.\n 7. Put object 2 on machine -> machine remains off. (Now objects 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 are on the machine? But note: we put 0,1,3,4,5,6, then 2. So all except 7 are on? But then we take 2 off and put 7 on.)\n\n 8. Take object 2 off -> machine remains off.\n 9. Put object 7 on the machine -> machine turns ON.\n\n At this point, the machine is on. The objects on the machine are: 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 (since we took off 2 and put 7).\n\n Then:\n 10. Take object 1 off -> machine turns off.\n 11. Take object 6 off -> machine remains off? (But note: it was already off, so no change? The history says \"off\" after taking 1 off and then after taking 6 off it's still off.)\n\n 12. Put object 1 back on -> machine turns on.\n 13. Take object 0 off -> machine remains on.\n 14. Take object 4 off -> machine remains on.\n 15. Take object 5 off -> machine remains on.\n 16. Take object 3 off -> machine remains on.\n\n Now, let's try to infer the rule:\n\n We see that when we put object 7 on (step 9) and the machine turned on. At that time, the objects on the machine were: 0,1,3,4,5,6,7.\n\n Then we removed object 1 and the machine turned off (step 10). Then we removed 6 (step 11) and it stayed off.\n\n Then we put object 1 back (step 12) and the machine turned on. This suggests that object 1 is critical.\n\n But note: when we put object 7 on (step 9) and the machine turned on, we had 7 objects on. Then we removed 1 and it turned off. Then we put 1 back and it turned on.\n\n Also, after step 12, we have: objects 0,3,4,5,6,7 are already on? Wait, let's recount:\n\n After step 9: objects on machine: 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 -> 7 objects, machine on.\n Step 10: remove 1 -> now 0,3,4,5,6,7 -> 6 objects, machine off.\n Step 11: remove 6 -> now 0,3,4,5,7 -> 5 objects, machine off.\n Step 12: put 1 back -> now 0,1,3,4,5,7 -> 6 objects, machine turns on.\n\n Then:\n Step 13: remove 0 -> now 1,3,4,5,7 -> 5 objects, but machine remains on.\n Step 14: remove 4 -> now 1,3,5,7 -> 4 objects, machine remains on.\n Step 15: remove 5 -> now 1,3,7 -> 3 objects, machine remains on.\n Step 16: remove 3 -> now 1,7 -> 2 objects, machine remains on.\n\n This suggests that the machine does not require all objects to be on. In fact, it seems that having object 1 and object 7 might be sufficient? But let's see:\n\n When we had only 1 and 7 (at the end) the machine is on. But also, note that when we had 0,1,3,4,5,7 (after step 12) and then we removed 0,4,5,3 one by one, the machine stayed on.\n\n However, we must note that in step 9, when we put 7 on, the machine turned on. But at that time we had 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. Why did it turn on then? Because we added 7?
