Our goal is to determine if object 4 is a blicket. A blicket is defined as an object whose state (on the machine or not) is not independent of the state of the machine (on or off). In other words, the machine's behavior changes when we manipulate the blicket.\n\nLet's summarize the state of the machine and the objects on the machine at each step:\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: 0, 2, 7 -> machine off? (The initial light is off, but note: after the first action, the machine turns on. However, the initial state has objects 0,2,7 on the machine and the machine is off. So the rule must not be satisfied by having only 0,2,7.)\n\nBut note: the initial machine light is off.

So with only object 5, the machine is on.\n\n5. > put object 7 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 5,7 -> machine remains on.\n\n6. > put object 6 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 5,7,6 -> machine remains on.\n\n7. > take object 5 off the machine\n   - Now on machine: 7,6 -> machine remains on.\n\n8. > put object 2 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 7,6,2 -> machine remains on.\n\n9. > put object 5 on the machine\n   - Now on machine: 7,6,2,5 -> machine remains on.\n\n10. > put object 3 on the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,6,2,5,3 -> machine remains on.\n\n11. > put object 4 on the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,6,2,5,3,4 -> machine remains on.\n\n12. > take object 4 off the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,6,2,5,3 -> machine remains on.\n\n13. > take object 3 off the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,6,2,5 -> machine remains on.\n\n14. > take object 2 off the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,6,5 -> machine remains on.\n\n15. > take object 6 off the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,5 -> machine remains on.\n\n16. > put object 4 on the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,5,4 -> machine remains on.\n\n17. > take object 5 off the machine\n    - Now on machine: 7,4 -> machine turns off.\n\n    This is the first time the machine turns off in an action.

We know that the machine turns on when the configuration of objects on the machine satisfies the rule.\n\nImportant observations:\n\n- Initially, with objects 0,2,7 on the machine, the machine is off. Then when we add object 5 (so 0,2,7,5), the machine turns on. So the rule must require at least object 5? Or a combination.\n\n- When we remove objects one by one (steps 2,3,4) and end up with only object 5 on the machine, the machine remains on. So object 5 alone can turn on the machine? But note step 17: when we remove object 5 and leave 7 and 4, the machine turns off. Also, step 4: after removing 7, we have only 5 and the machine is on.
