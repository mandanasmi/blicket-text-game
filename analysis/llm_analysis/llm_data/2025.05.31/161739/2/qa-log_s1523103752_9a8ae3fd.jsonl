That would imply that 3 is not a blicket.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine is on only when exactly one blicket is present? But let's see:\n\nStep 4: Put object 5 on the machine (now objects 3 and 5 are on) -> machine remains off? Actually, the step says: \"You put object 5 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\" So the machine was off (after step 3) and remains off even after adding 5.\n\nStep 5: Put object 2 on the machine (now objects 3, 5, and 2 are on) -> machine turns on.\n  - This step: \"You put object 2 on the machine. The light on the machine is now on.\"\n\nSo adding object 2 to the set {3,5} (which was off) turns the machine on. Therefore, object 2 must be a blicket? But note that the machine turned on when we added 2 to the existing set. So maybe the rule is that the machine is on if at least one blicket is present? Then why was the machine off when we had only object 3? Because we saw in step 3 that when only object 3 was present, the machine was off.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that the machine is on only if an odd number of blickets are present? Let's test:\n\n- Initially, no objects: off.\n- Step1: put 1 (if 1 is blicket, then 1 blicket -> odd -> on) -> on.\n- Step2: put 3 (if 3 is blicket, then now 2 blickets -> even -> off? But it stayed on. So that doesn't match because it remained on. Therefore, if 3 is a blicket, then we had 2 blickets and the machine should be off? But it was on. So that suggests 3 is not a blicket? Then why did the machine turn off when we removed 1? Because with only 3 (non-blicket) we have 0 blickets -> off.\n\nBut then step5: we had objects 3,5 (non-blickets) and then added 2. If 2 is a blicket, then we go from 0 blickets (off) to 1 blicket (on). That matches.\n\nStep6: Take object 2 off the machine -> machine turns off? \n  - We took object 2 off, leaving 3 and 5 (non-blickets) -> 0 blickets -> off.

Put object 1 on machine -> machine turns on.\n    So, with only object 1 on the machine, the machine is on.\n\n 2. Put object 3 on the machine (so now objects 1 and 3 are on the machine) -> machine remains on? \n    The text says: \"The light on the machine is now on.\" So it stayed on? \n    But note: after putting object 3, the machine was already on (from step 1) and it stayed on.\n\n 3. Take object 1 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n    Now only object 3 is on the machine and the machine is off.\n\n 4. Put object 5 on the machine (so now objects 3 and 5 are on the machine) -> machine remains off.\n\n 5. Put object 2 on the machine (so now objects 3, 5, and 2) -> machine turns on.\n\n 6. Take object 2 off the machine -> machine turns off.\n\n 7. Put object 7 on the machine (so now objects 3, 5, and 7) -> machine remains off.\n\n 8. Put object 4 on the machine (so now objects 3, 5, 7, 4) -> machine remains off.\n\n 9. Put object 0 on the machine (so now objects 3,5,7,4,0) -> machine remains off.\n\n10. Put object 6 on the machine (so now objects 3,5,7,4,0,6) -> machine remains off.\n\n Now, we need to figure out the rule that makes the machine turn on.\n\n From step 1: object 1 alone turns the machine on -> so object 1 is a blicket.\n\n Step 2: adding object 3 (which we later see in step 3 that without object 1, object 3 alone does not keep the machine on) doesn't turn it off? Actually, it was already on. But in step 3, when we remove object 1, the machine turns off. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket? Or maybe the rule requires more than one blicket? Let's see.\n\n Step 3: after removing object 1 (leaving object 3), the machine turns off. So with only object 3 on the machine, the machine is off.\n\n Step 4: adding object 5 (to object 3) does not turn the machine on -> so the set {3,5} does not turn the machine on.\n\n Step 5: adding object 2 to the set {3,5} turns the machine on. So the set {3,5,2} turns the machine on.\n\n Step 6: removing object 2 (leaving {3,5}) turns the machine off.\n\n Step 7: adding object 7 to {3,5} (so {3,5,7}) does not turn the machine on.\n\n Step 8: adding object 4 -> still off.\n Step 9: adding object 0 -> still off.\n Step 10: adding object 6 -> still off.\n\n Now, what do we know about object 2? When we added object 2 to the machine (with objects 3 and 5 already present) the machine turned on. Then when we removed object 2, it turned off. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n But note: when we put object 2 on the machine in step 5, we started with {3,5} (which was off) and then added 2 and it turned on. So the set {3,5,2} is on. However, we don't know if the rule is that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is present? But then:\n\n Step 1: object 1 alone -> on (so object 1 is a blicket).\n Step 3: only object 3 -> off (so object 3 is not a blicket).\n Step 4: objects 3 and 5 -> off (so object 5 is not a blicket? or if the rule requires more?).\n\n However, step 5: adding object 2 to {3,5} turns it on. If the rule were \"at least one blicket\", then we already had objects 3 and 5 and it was off, so neither 3 nor 5 are blickets.
