Then when we remove object 1 (action 6), the machine turns off. This suggests that object 1 is necessary at that point? But note that later we see that without object 1 we can have the machine on? Actually, after removing object 1, the machine turns off. Then when we put object 1 back (action 8) the machine turns on again.\n\nBut then we remove object 5 (action 9) and the machine remains on. Then remove object 4 (action 10) and the machine remains on. Then remove object 6 (action 11) and the machine remains on. So at the end, only [0,1] are on the machine and the machine is on.\n\nSo what changed? We see that after action 8, the machine is on with [4,6,5,0,1]. Then removing 5, then 4, then 6, the machine stays on. This suggests that the rule might be that the machine is on if and only if both object 0 and object 1 are on the machine? Let's check:\n\n- When we have [0,1] at the end, the machine is on.\n\nBut what about when we first turned it on? We had [4,6,3,5,1,0] and it turned on. Then we removed 1 and it turned off. Then we removed 3 and it was still off. Then we put 1 back (so now [4,6,5,0,1]) and it turned on. Then we removed 5,4,6 and it stayed on? So the presence of 5,4,6 doesn't matter when 0 and 1 are present.\n\nBut what about object 2? We haven't touched object 2 at all. And object 7? Also not touched.\n\nNow, note that in the initial state, object 4 was on the machine and the machine was off. So object 4 alone is not sufficient.\n\nAlso, when we put objects 6,3,5,1 one by one (without 0) the machine remained off. Then when we put 0, it turned on.\n\nThen when we removed 1, it turned off.

Take object 6 off -> light still on\n    - Now only objects 0 and 1 -> light on.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\n- The machine turns on when a particular set of blickets is present. We are to find which objects are blickets (i.e., their presence affects the machine).\n\nLet's try to deduce the rule:\n\nFrom the initial steps (1-5): \n- The machine was off with objects 4,6,3,5,1. Then adding object 0 turned it on.\n\nBut then when we remove object 1 (step 6), the machine turns off. So object 1 seems critical at that point? However, note that at step 8, we put object 1 back and it turns on again.\n\nBut then we remove object 5 (step 9) and the light remains on. Then we remove object 4 (step 10) and the light remains on. Then we remove object 6 (step 11) and the light remains on. So at the end, we only have objects 0 and 1 on the machine and the light is on.\n\nTherefore, the machine must be on when both object 0 and object 1 are present? But wait, let's check:\n\nAfter step 5: objects [4,6,3,5,1,0] are on -> light on.\n\nAfter step 6: remove object 1 -> objects [4,6,3,5,0] -> light off. So without object 1, the light is off.\n\nAfter step 7: remove object 3 -> still [4,6,5,0] -> off.\n\nAfter step 8: add object 1 -> [4,6,5,0,1] -> on.\n\nThen remove object 5: [4,6,0,1] -> on.\n\nRemove object 4: [6,0,1] -> on.\n\nRemove object 6: [0,1] -> on.\n\nSo it seems that the machine is on if and only if both object 0 and object 1 are on the machine? But what about the other objects?\n\nLet's test with the initial state: only object 4 was on the machine -> off. Then when we added others without 0 and 1, it remained off until we added 0 and 1.\n\nBut note that at step 8, when we had objects 4,6,5,0 and we added 1, it turned on. Then we removed non-0 and non-1 objects and the light stayed on until we had only 0 and 1.\n\nSo it seems that the machine turns on if and only if both object 0 and object 1 are present.

We know that the machine turns on only when a particular condition is met. We also know that blickets are objects that are not independent of the machine state.\n\nFrom the interactions:\n\n- When we had [4,6,3,5,1] and added 0, the machine turned on. So the set [4,6,3,5,1,0] turns the machine on. But note that the machine was off before adding 0, so the set [4,6,3,5,1] was not sufficient.\n\n- Then, when we removed 1, the machine turned off. So without 1, the set [4,6,3,5,0] does not turn the machine on.\n\n- Then we removed 3, so [4,6,5,0] and the machine remained off.\n\n- Then we added 1, so we got [4,6,5,0,1] and the machine turned on. This suggests that the set [4,6,5,0,1] is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\n- Then we removed 5 -> [4,6,0,1] and the machine stayed on. So the set [4,6,0,1] is sufficient.\n\n- Then we removed 4 -> [6,0,1] and the machine stayed on.\n\n- Then we removed 6 -> [0,1] and the machine stayed on.\n\nThis last part is interesting: the machine remained on even when we had only [0,1] on the machine.\n\nBut note: at the very beginning, when we had only [4] (object 4 alone) the machine was off. Then we added 6 -> [4,6] and it was still off. Then we added 3 -> [4,6,3] off, then 5 -> [4,6,3,5] off, then 1 -> [4,6,3,5,1] off, then 0 -> [4,6,3,5,1,0] on.\n\nSo the minimal set that we see turning the machine on is [0,1] because at the end the machine stayed on with only [0,1].

Let's analyze step by step to infer the rule and which objects are blickets.\n\nInitial state:\n- Objects on machine: [4]\n- Objects on floor: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7]\n- Machine is off.\n\nActions and outcomes:\n\n1. Put object 6 on machine -> Machine off.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6]\n   - Still off.\n\n2. Put object 3 on machine -> Machine off.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,3]\n   - Off.\n\n3. Put object 5 on machine -> Machine off.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,3,5]\n   - Off.\n\n4. Put object 1 on machine -> Machine off.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,3,5,1]\n   - Off.\n\n5. Put object 0 on machine -> Machine turns on.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,3,5,1,0]\n   - On.\n\n   This suggests that object 0 might be critical. But note: when we added object 0, the machine turned on. However, we must check if it's the only one or if there's a rule.\n\n6. Take object 1 off -> Machine turns off.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,3,5,0] (without 1)\n   - Off.\n\n   This indicates that object 1 is necessary for the machine to be on? Because when we removed it, the machine turned off.\n\n7. Take object 3 off -> Machine remains off.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,5,0]\n   - Still off.\n\n8. Put object 1 back on -> Machine turns on.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,5,0,1]   (note: object 3 is still off)\n   - On.\n\n   This again suggests that object 1 is critical. But note that object 3 was taken off and not put back, and the machine turned on without it.\n\n9. Take object 5 off -> Machine remains on.\n   - Now on machine: [4,6,0,1]\n   - Still on.\n\n   This indicates that object 5 is not necessary for the machine to stay on? Because removing it didn't turn the machine off.\n\n10. Take object 4 off -> Machine remains on.\n    - Now on machine: [6,0,1]\n    - Still on.\n\n11. Take object 6 off -> Machine remains on.\n    - Now on machine: [0,1]\n    - Still on.\n\nFrom the last steps, we see that with only objects 0 and 1 on the machine, the machine is on.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct:\n\n- The machine turned on for the first time when we added object 0 to the set [4,6,3,5,1]. But then when we removed object 1, it turned off. And when we put object 1 back (without object 3 and 5) and then removed 5 and 4 and 6, the machine stayed on with just 0 and 1.\n\nSo what is the rule?\n\nConsider that the machine might require a specific set of blickets to be present. From the last state, we see that objects 0 and 1 together are sufficient to turn on the machine. Also, note that when we had [4,6,3,5,1] (without 0) the machine was off, and adding 0 turned it on. But then removing 1 turned it off, and then putting 1 back turned it on again.\n\nMoreover, when we removed objects 5, 4, and 6 (which were on the machine initially and then added) the machine remained on. This suggests that none of them (objects 4,5,6) are necessary for the machine to be on. Also, object 3 was removed and not put back, and the machine turned on without it.\n\nTherefore, the blickets must be among the objects that are critical for turning the machine on. We see that objects 0 and 1 are critical because:\n\n- Without object 1 (even with 0 and others) the machine turned off (step 6). And then putting 1 back turned it on (step 8).\n- Without object 0, the machine was off until it was added (step 5).\n\nAlso, note that in the initial state, only object 4 was on the machine and the machine was off. Then we added several objects without turning the machine on until object 0 was added.\n\nBut when we removed object 5 and 4 and 6, the machine remained on with only 0 and 1. So objects 4,5,6 are not blickets?
