We need to determine if object 0 is a blicket.\n\nRecall: Blickets are objects that have \"blicketness\" and can make the machine turn on, but only according to a hidden rule.\n\nLet's analyze the interactions step by step:\n\nInitial state:\n- Machine light is off.\n- Objects: \n  - 0: floor\n  - 1: floor\n  - 2: floor\n  - 3: on machine\n  - 4: floor\n  - 5: floor\n  - 6: floor\n  - 7: floor\n\n> Action 1: put object 0 on the machine.\n  - After: objects on machine: 0 and 3 (since 3 was initially there).\n  - Light: off.\n\n> Action 2: put object 4 on the machine.\n  - Now on machine: 0, 3, 4.\n  - Light: off.\n\n> Action 3: put object 1 on the machine.\n  - Now on machine: 0, 3, 4, 1.\n  - Light turns ON.\n\nThis suggests that having object 1 on the machine (along with the others) caused the machine to turn on. So object 1 is likely a blicket.\n\nBut note: we don't know the rule. It could be that the machine turns on when a specific set of blickets are present.\n\n> Action 4: take object 0 off the machine.\n  - Now on machine: 3, 4, 1 (since we removed 0).\n  - Light turns off.\n\nThis is interesting: when we remove object 0 (which was present when the machine was on) the machine turns off. This might suggest that object 0 is necessary for the machine to be on? But let's see.\n\n> Action 5: take object 3 off the machine.\n  - Now on machine: 4, 1 (since we removed 3 as well).\n  - Light remains off.\n\nSo now we have only 4 and 1 on the machine and the light is off.\n\n> Action 6: put object 0 on the machine.\n  - Now on machine: 4, 1, and 0 (we added 0).\n  - Light turns on.\n\nSo with 0, 4, and 1 on the machine, the light is on.\n\n> Action 7: take object 4 off the machine.\n  - Now on machine: 0 and 1.\n  - Light remains on.\n\nThis is critical: with only 0 and 1 on the machine, the light is on.\n\nLet's summarize the states when the machine is on:\n\n1. When we had objects [0, 3, 4, 1] on the machine, the light turned on (at action 3).\n   - But note: when we removed 0 (leaving 3,4,1) the light went off. So that set (3,4,1) does not turn the machine on.\n\n2. After putting 0 back (with 4 and 1 already on) we had [0,4,1] and the light turned on (action 6).\n\n3. Then we removed 4, leaving [0,1] and the light stayed on (action 7).\n\nTherefore, the set {0,1} is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\nBut note that at the beginning, when we had [0,3,4] the light was off. Then adding 1 turned it on. So 1 is critical.\n\nAlso, when we had [3,4,1] (after removing 0) the light was off. Then adding 0 turned it on. So 0 is critical.\n\nMoreover, the machine remains on with just 0 and 1.\n\nSo what is the rule? It seems that the machine turns on if and only if both object 0 and object 1 are on the machine. \n\nBut let's check the initial state: object 3 was on the machine alone and the light was off. Then we added 0 and 4 and it was still off. Then we added 1 and it turned on. That fits.\n\nAlso, when we had 4 and 1 (without 0) the light was off. Then adding 0 turned it on. That fits.\n\nAnd when we had 0 and 1 (without 4) the light was on. Then removing 4 left 0 and 1 and the light stayed on. That fits.\n\nNow, what about object 3? It was initially on the machine and the light was off. Then when we added 0 and 4, the light was still off. Then we added 1 and it turned on. Then we removed 3 and the light went off?

Wait, step 4: after taking object 0 off, the machine turns off. So when we had objects 3,4,1 the machine was off? But then when we had 3,0,4,1 it was on? Then removing 0 (leaving 3,4,1) turned it off.\n\nNow, when we put object 0 back (step 6) without object 3 (which was taken off in step 5) and with 4 and 1, the machine turns on. Then when we remove object 4 (step 7), the machine remains on (with objects 0 and 1).\n\nSo let's list the sets of objects on the machine when the light is on:\n\nState 1 (on): {3, 0, 4, 1}\nState 2 (on): {4, 1, 0}   (after step 6)\nState 3 (on): {1, 0}      (after step 7, removing 4)\n\nBut note: after step 7, we removed 4 and the light remained on. So the set {0,1} is sufficient to turn the machine on.\n\nWhat about when the machine is off?\n\n- Initially: {3} -> off? (because initially object3 was on the machine and the light was off)\n- After step1: {3,0} -> off\n- After step2: {3,0,4} -> off\n- After step3: {3,0,4,1} -> on\n- After step4: {3,4,1} -> off (removed 0)\n- After step5: {4,1} -> off (removed 3)\n- Then step6: {4,1,0} -> on\n- Then step7: {0,1} -> on (removed 4)\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal set that causes the machine to turn on.\n\nNotice that the machine turns on when we add object1 to {3,0,4} (step3).
