However, when combined with object 2, the machine turns on. This suggests that object 2 is likely a blicket, and object 0 might not be a blicket on its own but could be part of a combination that turns on the machine.\n\nThe key observation is that object 2 seems to be necessary for the machine to turn on, as the machine turns on when object 2 is present with object 0.
