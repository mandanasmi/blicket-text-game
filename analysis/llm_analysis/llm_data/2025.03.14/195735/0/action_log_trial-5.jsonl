Here's what I've observed:\n\n1. Object 3 alone turns the machine on.\n2. Object 2 alone does not turn the machine on, but when combined with object 3, it does.\n3. Object 0 and object 1 alone do not turn the machine on, but they do not interfere with the machine being on when object 3 is present.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 3 is a blicket, as it consistently turns the machine on when placed on it. Object 2 might also be a blicket, but it only turns the machine on when combined with object 3. Objects 0 and 1 do not seem to be blickets, as they do not turn the machine on by themselves and do not affect the machine's state when combined with object 3.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that object 3 must be present, and object 2 can also contribute to turning the machine on when combined with object 3.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test object 2 alone again to see if it ever turns the machine on by itself, which would help clarify its role.\n\n> take object 2 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it.

In multiple instances, placing object 3 on the machine resulted in the light turning on, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nThe consistent behavior of the machine turning on when object 3 is placed on it, and turning off when it is removed, strongly suggests that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
