You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Object 3**: \n   - When placed on the machine alone, the light turned on. \n   - When object 3 was removed while object 2 was on the machine, the light turned off. \n   - When object 3 was placed back on the machine with object 2, the light turned on again.\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine alone, the light turned on.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, either alone or with other objects. This indicates that object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
