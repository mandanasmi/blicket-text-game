Object 3, when placed on the machine alone, does not turn the light on. However, when combined with object 0, the light turns on, which suggests that object 3 is not a blicket on its own.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule for the machine turning on is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. Objects 0, 1, and 2 are blickets, while object 3 is not.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test object 3 with another known blicket to see if the machine turns on, which would further confirm that object 3 is not a blicket.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
