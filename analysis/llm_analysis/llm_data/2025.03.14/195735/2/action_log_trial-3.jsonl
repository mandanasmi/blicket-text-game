After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor, object 3 is on top of the machine. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> take object 3 off machine\nYou took object 3 off of the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 0 on machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine. The light on the machine is currently off.\n> put object 1 on machine\nYou put object 1 on the machine.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Reflecting on the collected information, I observed the following:\n\n1. Initially, object 3 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. After removing object 3, the light remained off.\n3. Placing objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine individually or together did not turn the light on.\n4. Placing object 3 on the machine turned the light on.\n5. Removing object 3 turned the light off again.\n6. Placing object 3 back on the machine turned the light on again.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 3 is the only object that affects the state of the machine, as the light turns on only when object 3 is on the machine. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket, as its presence on the machine is correlated with the machine's state (light on).\n\nThere are no apparent issues with this reasoning, as the behavior of the machine consistently changes with the presence of object 3.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
