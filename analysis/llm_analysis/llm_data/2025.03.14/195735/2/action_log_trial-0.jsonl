Removing object 3 from the machine turned it off, even when other objects were on the machine.\n5. Placing object 3 back on the machine turned it on again.\n6. The machine's state (on/off) seems to be directly dependent on whether object 3 is on it.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 3 is the only object that affects the machine's state, indicating that it is a blicket.
