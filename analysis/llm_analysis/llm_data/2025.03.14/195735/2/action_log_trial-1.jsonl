Object 0 on machine: Light off.\n2. Object 1 on machine: Light on.\n3. Object 0 off machine: Light off.\n4. Object 2 on machine: Light off.\n5. Object 3 on machine: Light off.\n6.

Object 1 off machine: Light off.\n12. Object 0 on machine: Light off.\n13. Object 1 on machine: Light on.\n14. Object 0 off machine: Light off.\n15. Object 1 on machine: Light off.\n16. Object 0 on machine: Light on.\n17. Object 0 off machine: Light off.\n18. Object 1 on machine: Light off.\n19. Object 0 on machine: Light on.\n\nFrom these interactions, we can infer the following:\n\n- Object 1 is a blicket because it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine with object 0.\n- Object 0 is not a blicket on its own, as it does not turn the light on by itself.\n- Object 2 and object 3 do not affect the light when placed on the machine, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket because it does not influence the state of the machine's light.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
