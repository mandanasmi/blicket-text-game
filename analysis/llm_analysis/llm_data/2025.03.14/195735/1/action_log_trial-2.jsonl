Initially, placing objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine individually or in combination did not turn the machine on. Only when object 3 was added did the machine turn on.\n2. Removing object 3 while object 0 was on the machine turned the machine off, indicating that object 3 is necessary for the machine to be on.\n3. Placing object 3 on the machine without object 0 did not turn the machine on, but adding object 0 turned it on, suggesting that both objects 0 and 3 together are required to turn the machine on.\n4. Object 2 was placed on the machine multiple times, but it never contributed to turning the machine on, either alone or with other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule for the machine to turn on is that both object 0 and object 3 need to be on the machine simultaneously.
