When object 0 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n2. When object 1, 2, or 3 is placed on the machine individually, the light does not turn on. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets on their own.\n3. When object 0 is on the machine, the light is on regardless of the presence of other objects. This further confirms that object 0 is a blicket.\n4. The light only turns on when object 0 is on the machine, and it turns off when object 0 is removed, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the rule for the machine turning on is that object 0 must be on the machine. Since object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself and does not affect the machine when object 0 is not present, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
