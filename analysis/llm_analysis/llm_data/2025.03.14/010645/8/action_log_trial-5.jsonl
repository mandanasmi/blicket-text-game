You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Then, output the answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. When object 1 is on the machine, the light turns on. Removing object 1 turns the light off, indicating object 1 is a blicket.\n2. When object 3 is placed on the machine, the light turns on. Removing object 3 turns the light off, indicating object 3 is a blicket.\n3. Object 2 does not affect the light when placed alone, but when combined with object 3, the light remains on, suggesting object 3 is the active blicket in that scenario.\n4. Object 0 does not affect the light when placed alone, and when combined with object 1 or 3, the light is on, but this is due to the presence of object 1 or 3.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, either alone or with other objects. Therefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room.
