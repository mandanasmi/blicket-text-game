Object 1 and object 3 do not turn the machine on when placed individually. However, when object 1 is placed on the machine with either object 0 or object 2, the machine stays on, suggesting that object 1 might not interfere with the machine's operation when a blicket is present. Object 3, on the other hand, seems to have no effect on the machine's operation.\n\nThe rule might be that the machine turns on if at least one blicket is on it, and object 1 does not interfere with the machine's operation when a blicket is present.

This indicates that both object 0 and object 2 are blickets.\n- Object 1, when placed individually on the machine, does not turn the light on. However, when object 1 is placed on the machine with either object 0 or object 2, the light turns on. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n- Object 3, when placed individually on the machine, does not turn the light on. Additionally, when object 3 is placed on the machine with object 1, the light remains off.
