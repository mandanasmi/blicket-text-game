This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n- When object 3 is removed from the machine, the light turns off, indicating that object 3 is necessary for the light to be on in some cases.\n- When object 3 is on the machine with other objects, the light remains on, further supporting that object 3 is a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
