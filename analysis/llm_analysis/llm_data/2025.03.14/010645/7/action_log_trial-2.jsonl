This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n- Object 3, when placed on the machine, also consistently turns the machine on. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n- Object 0 and object 2 do not turn the machine on when placed alone, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nThe machine turns on with either object 1 or object 3, suggesting that the rule could be that any single blicket can turn the machine on.\n\nTherefore, based on the observations, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
