Initially, object 3 was on the machine, and the light was on. When object 3 was removed, the light turned off.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. Removing object 1 turned the light off.\n3. Placing object 2 on the machine did not turn the light on.\n4. Placing object 3 back on the machine turned the light on again.\n5. The light remained on when object 3 was on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 3 is a blicket because it consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, and the light turns off when it is removed.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
