Object 0 also seems to be a blicket, as the machine turns on when both object 0 and object 2 are on the machine. Object 1 and object 3 do not appear to be blickets on their own, as they do not turn the machine on when placed individually. However, object 1 does not interfere with the machine being on when object 2 is present, suggesting it might not affect the machine's state. Object 3, when placed with object 2, does not turn the machine off, which suggests it might not interfere either.\n\nThe rule might be that object 2 is required to turn the machine on, and object 0 can also turn it on when combined with object 2.
