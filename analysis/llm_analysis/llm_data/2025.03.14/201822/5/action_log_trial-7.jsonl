Initially, the machine was off with object 3 on it.\n2. Removing object 3 did not change the machine's state (it remained off).\n3. Placing objects 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 on the machine did not turn it on.\n4. Placing object 6 on the machine turned it on.\n5. Removing object 6 turned the machine off.\n6. Placing object 7 on the machine also turned it on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n\n- Object 6, when placed on the machine, turns it on, and when removed, turns it off. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket because its presence directly affects the machine's state.\n- Object 7 also turns the machine on, suggesting it might also be a blicket.\n- Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not affect the machine's state, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nTherefore, based on the definition of a blicket and the observations, object 6 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
