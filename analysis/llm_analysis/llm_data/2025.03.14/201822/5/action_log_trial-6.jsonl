Adding object 2 did not change the state (light remained on).\n   - When object 2 was on the machine with object 3, the light was off.\n   - When object 2 was on the machine with object 4, the light was on. Removing object 2 turned the light off, suggesting object 4 alone is not a blicket.\n   - When object 2 was on the machine with object 5, the light was on. Removing object 2 turned the light off, suggesting object 5 alone is not a blicket.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   - Object 2 alone does not turn the machine on, indicating it is not a blicket by itself.\n   - Object 2 seems to contribute to turning the machine on when combined with certain other objects (like object 4 and object 5), but this does not necessarily mean it is a blicket. It could be that object 2 is not a blicket, but rather that the other objects are blickets and object 2 does not interfere with their effect.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key observation is that object 2 alone does not turn the machine on, which is a strong indication that it is not a blicket.
