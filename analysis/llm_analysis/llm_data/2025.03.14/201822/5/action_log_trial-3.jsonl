Removing object 0 did not affect the light, which stayed on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 1 might be a blicket, as its addition turned the machine on. Objects 2 and 3 did not change the state of the machine when added, but since the machine was already on, we cannot yet determine their effect. Object 0 is likely not a blicket, as its presence did not turn the machine on.\n\nTo further investigate, I should test the effect of removing object 1, as it was the first object that turned the machine on. This will help confirm if object 1 is indeed a blicket. If the machine turns off after removing object 1, it would strongly suggest that object 1 is a blicket. If the machine stays on, it would imply that either object 2 or 3 (or both) are also blickets.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to remove object 1 from the machine.\n\n> take object 1 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
