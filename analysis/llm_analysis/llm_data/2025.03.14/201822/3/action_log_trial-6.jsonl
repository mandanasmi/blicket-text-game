Removing object 4 turned the machine off, indicating that object 4 is a blicket.\n2. Placing object 0, 1, 5, 6, or 7 on the machine did not turn it on, suggesting these are not blickets.\n3. Placing object 2 on the machine turned it on, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n4. Placing object 3 on the machine while object 2 was on it kept the machine on, but when object 2 was removed, the machine turned off. This suggests that object 3 is not a blicket, and the machine was on due to object 2.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule for the machine turning on is that at least one blicket must be on it. So far, objects 2 and 4 are confirmed blickets.\n\nTo further confirm the rule and check if there are any other blickets, I should test the remaining objects individually. However, since I've already tested all objects individually and only objects 2 and 4 turned the machine on, I can conclude that these are the only blickets.\n\nTherefore, my plan is to exit the task as I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
