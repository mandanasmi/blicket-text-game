This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Object 5 and 6:**\n   - When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n2. **Object 5 and 6 Tests:**\n   - When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 5 is a blicket.\n   - When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on only when object 5 was also on the machine. This suggests that object 6 is not a blicket on its own, but it does not affect the machine's state when object 5 is present.\n\n3. **Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- The tests consistently show that object 5 is necessary to turn the machine on, while object 6 does not independently affect the machine. Object 7, like objects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, does not turn the machine on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
