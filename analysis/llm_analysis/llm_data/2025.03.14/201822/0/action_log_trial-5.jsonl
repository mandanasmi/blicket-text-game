You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, object 6 was on the machine, and the light was off. When object 6 was removed, the light remained off.\n2. Placing objects 0 through 5 on the machine did not turn the light on.\n3. When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n4. Adding object 7 to the machine while object 6 was already on kept the light on.\n5. Removing object 6 while object 7 was on the machine turned the light off.\n6. Placing object 7 on the machine without object 6 did not turn the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 6 is a blicket because it consistently turns the machine on when placed on it. Object 7, however, does not turn the machine on by itself and only keeps the light on when object 6 is already on the machine. Therefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 8 objects scattered around the room.
