Here's a summary of the observations:\n\n1. Objects 0 and 1 do not turn the machine on.\n2. Object 2 turns the machine on.\n3. Object 3 turns the machine on.\n4. Object 4 turns the machine on.\n5. Object 5 turns the machine on.\n6. Objects 6 and 7 do not turn the machine on.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that objects 2, 3, 4, and 5 are blickets, as they are the ones that cause the machine to turn on. Objects 0, 1, 6, and 7 do not seem to be blickets, as they do not affect the machine's state when placed on it.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that at least one blicket must be on the machine for it to turn on. When any of the objects 2, 3, 4, or 5 are on the machine, the light turns on, indicating that these objects contain blicktness.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test one more object that I suspect is a blicket (object 3) by itself to ensure it turns the machine on.\n\n> take object 6 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

These objects are likely the blickets.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will ensure that the machine turns on with only one of these objects on it and turns off when none of them are on it.
