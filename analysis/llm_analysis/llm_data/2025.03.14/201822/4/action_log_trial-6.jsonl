Objects 0, 3, 6, and 7 did not turn the machine on, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that at least one blicket must be on the machine for it to activate. This is supported by the fact that the machine turned on with any of the suspected blickets (1, 2, 4, 5) and turned off when they were removed.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test one more object that I suspect is a blicket to ensure consistency.
