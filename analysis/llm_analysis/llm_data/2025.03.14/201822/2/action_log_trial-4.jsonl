You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, the machine was off with object 5 on it. Removing object 5 did not change the state of the machine.\n2. Placing objects 0 through 7 on the machine individually did not turn the light on, except for object 0.\n3. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n4. When object 5 was placed on the machine with object 0, the light remained on, but removing object 0 turned the light off, indicating object 5 is not a blicket.\n5. Repeated tests with object 0 confirmed it consistently turned the light on, while other objects did not affect the light when placed alone or with object 0.\n\nFrom these observations, object 7 did not turn the light on when placed on the machine, either alone or with other objects. The light only turned on when object 0 was involved, indicating that object 7 does not have the property of a blicket.\n\nTherefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
