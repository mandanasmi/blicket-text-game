When object 2 is on the machine alone, the machine turns on, indicating that object 2 is a blicket. However, when object 4 is on the machine alone, the machine does not turn on, suggesting that object 4 is not a blicket by itself. \n\nObject 7 was tested alone and did not turn the machine on. There is no evidence that object 7 contributes to turning the machine on in combination with other objects, as the machine only turned on with object 2 and object 4 together.
