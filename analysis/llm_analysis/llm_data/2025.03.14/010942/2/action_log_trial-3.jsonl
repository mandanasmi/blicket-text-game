Initially, object 1 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 1 is a blicket.\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine with object 1, the light remained on, but when object 1 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n3. Objects 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were placed on the machine individually or with other non-blicket objects, and the light remained off. This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n4. When object 2 was placed on the machine with object 1, the light turned on, but when object 1 was removed, the light turned off.
