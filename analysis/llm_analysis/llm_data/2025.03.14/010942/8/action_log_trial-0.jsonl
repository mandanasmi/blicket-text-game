This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n- Object 6, when placed on the machine, also consistently turns the light on. This suggests that object 6 is a blicket.\n- Object 7, when placed on the machine alone, does not turn the light on. However, when object 7 is placed on the machine with object 1 or object 6, the light remains on. This suggests that object 7 is not a blicket on its own, as it does not independently cause the machine to turn on.\n\nTherefore, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
