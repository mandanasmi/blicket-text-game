This further supports that object 1 is a blicket, as object 0's presence or absence did not affect the light.\n\n4. **Removing Object 1**:\n   - When object 1 was removed, the light turned off. This strongly suggests that object 1 is indeed a blicket, as its removal directly caused the light to turn off.\n\n5. **Test with Object 2**:\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 2 might also be a blicket.\n\n6. **Test with Object 3**:\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light remained on.
