This suggests that no single object is a blicket on its own.\n\n2. **Combination Tests**: I attempted to place multiple objects on the machine to see if a combination of objects would turn the light on. After several attempts, I found that placing objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine resulted in the light turning on.\n\n3. **Inference**: Since the light turned on with objects 0, 1, and 2 on the machine, it suggests that the rule for the machine to turn on might require a specific combination of objects. However, since the light did not turn on with any single object, it indicates that no single object is a blicket. Instead, the combination of objects 0, 1, and 2 together might be necessary to activate the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The rule for the machine to turn on seems to be that a specific combination of objects (0, 1, and 2) is required. None of the objects are blickets individually, but together they act as a blicket.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will now test the combination of objects 0, 1, and 2 again to confirm the rule.\n\n> put object 0 on machine, put object 1 on machine, put object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

This further supports that object 0 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n   - When object 2 was placed on the machine with object 0 and object 1, the light turned on. However, since object 2 alone was already known to turn the light on, the presence of object 0 does not change the outcome.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 0 does not have the property of blicktness, as it does not turn the machine on either alone or in combination with other non-blicket objects.

This suggests that object 2 is likely a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was tested individually and did not turn the machine on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 6, when placed on the machine alone, did not activate it. Since the machine only turned on with the combination of objects 0, 1, and 2, and object 6 was not part of this combination, object 6 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, object 6 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
