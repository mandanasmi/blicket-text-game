Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. Initially, object 2 was on the machine, and the light was off. This suggests that object 2 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, indicating object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. Similarly, placing object 1 on the machine did not turn the light on, suggesting object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n4. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 3 is likely a blicket, as it caused the machine to activate.\n\n5. Removing object 3 turned the light off, further supporting that object 3 is necessary for the machine to be on.\n\n6. Placing object 3 back on the machine turned the light on again, reinforcing the idea that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n7. When both objects 2 and 3 were on the machine, the light was on. However, removing object 3 turned the light off, indicating that object 2 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that object 3 is the only object that consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it. Therefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room.
