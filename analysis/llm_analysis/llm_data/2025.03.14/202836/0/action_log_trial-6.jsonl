This suggests object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 1:**\n   - Placing object 1 on the machine (with object 0) does not turn it on. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Testing Object 2:**\n   - Placing object 2 on the machine turns it on. This suggests object 2 is a blicket.\n\n5. **Testing Object 3:**\n   - Placing object 3 on the machine (with object 2) keeps it on. This suggests object 3 might also be a blicket.\n\n6. **Removing Object 2:**\n   - Removing object 2 turns the machine off, even though object 3 is still on the machine. This confirms that object 2 is a blicket and suggests that object 3 alone is not sufficient to turn on the machine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Object 2 is definitely a blicket because it turns the machine on by itself.\n- Object 3 does not turn the machine on by itself, as evidenced by the machine turning off when object 2 is removed.\n- Objects 0 and 1 are not blickets since they did not turn the machine on.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n- The machine turns on if object 2 is on it. Object 3 does not affect the machine's state when object 2 is not present.\n\nNext, I will test object 3 alone to confirm its status.\n\n> take object 3 off machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
