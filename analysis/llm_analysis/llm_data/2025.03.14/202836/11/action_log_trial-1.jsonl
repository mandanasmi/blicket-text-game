You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Removing it turns the light off.\n   - Object 2: Placing it on the machine turns the light on. Removing it turns the light off.\n   - Object 3: Placing it on the machine turns the light on.

This is evident because the machine turns on with any of the objects 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 placed on it individually, and turns off when they are removed.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Objects 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are blickets.\n   - The rule for the machine is that it turns on if at least one blicket is on it.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will now exit the game as I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
