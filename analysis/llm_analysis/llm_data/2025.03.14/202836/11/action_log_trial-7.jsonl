This suggests that neither object 5 nor object 6 alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. **Testing Individual Objects:**\n   - After removing objects 5 and 6, I tested objects 0, 1, and 2 individually, and the light remained off for each.

This suggests that object 6 alone does not turn the machine on.\n   - Object 6 was later placed on the machine with object 4, and the light was on, but since object 4 alone can turn the light on, this does not indicate that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - There was no instance where object 6 alone turned the machine on, nor was there any evidence that object 6 contributed to turning the machine on in combination with other objects.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 6 does not appear to be a blicket, as there is no evidence that it affects the state of the machine.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
