So far, I've tested each object individually and in some combinations, but the machine has not turned on. Here's a summary of what I've done and observed:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Machine is off.\n   - Objects 0, 1, 2 are on the floor.\n   - Object 3 was initially on the machine, but the machine was off.\n\n2. **Tests Conducted**:\n   - **Object 3**: Removed from the machine, no change (machine off).\n   - **Object 0**: Placed on the machine, no change (machine off).\n   - **Object 1**: Placed on the machine, no change (machine off).\n   - **Object 2**: Placed on the machine, no change (machine off).\n   - **Object 3**: Placed back on the machine, no change (machine off).\n   - **Object 0 and 1**: Both on the machine, no change (machine off).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - None of the objects individually or in the combinations tested so far have turned the machine on.\n   - It's possible that the machine requires a specific combination of objects to turn on, or that none of the objects are blickets.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - I need to test more combinations to see if a specific pair or group of objects will turn the machine on.\n   - Since object 1 is already on the machine, I will try adding object 2 to see if the combination of objects 1 and 2 turns the machine on.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next logical step is to test the combination of objects 1 and 2 on the machine.\n\n> put object 2 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

The light's state is solely dependent on object 2. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
