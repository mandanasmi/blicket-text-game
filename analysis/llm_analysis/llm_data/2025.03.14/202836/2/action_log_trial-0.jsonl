This suggests that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Combinations:**\n   - When object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 1 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Placing object 1 back on the machine turned the light on again, confirming object 1's status as a blicket.\n   - Object 0, object 2, and object 3 were placed on the machine in various combinations, but the light only turned on when object 1 was present.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Object 2:**\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine alone, and the light remained off.\n   - Object 2 was also on the machine with object 1, but since object 1 alone can turn the light on, object 2's presence does not affect the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 2 does not have any effect on the machine's state and is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.
