You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was on. When object 0 was removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n3. When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light remained off. This suggests that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n4. When object 3 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n5. When object 0 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on, confirming object 0 is a blicket.\n\n6. When object 3 was placed on the machine with object 0 removed, the light turned on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\n7. When object 3 was removed, the light turned off, further confirming that object 3 is a blicket.\n\n8. When object 3 was placed on the machine again, the light turned on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket because it consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
