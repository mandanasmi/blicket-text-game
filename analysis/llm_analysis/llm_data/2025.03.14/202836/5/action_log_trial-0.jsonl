Placing objects 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the machine does not turn the light on, either individually or in combination with each other.\n6. Placing object 3 back on the machine turns the light on again, confirming its effect.\n\nFrom these observations, object 3 is the only object that consistently causes the machine's light to turn on when placed on it. This indicates that object 3 has a special property, which we define as \"blicktness,\" that interacts with the machine to turn the light on.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is a blicket because its presence on the machine is directly correlated with the machine's light turning on, demonstrating a nonzero mutual information between the state of object 3 and the state of the machine.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
