This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n3. **Testing Object 6**: When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket because it has a direct influence on the machine's state.\n4. **Testing Object 7**: When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light remained on. However, when object 6 was removed, the light turned off, suggesting that object 7 alone does not turn the machine on. Object 7 might be a blicket if it requires object 6 to be present to influence the machine, but this is not confirmed yet.\n5. **Removing Objects 6 and 7**: Removing object 6 turned the light off, confirming its influence. Removing object 7 after object 6 was already removed did not change the state, reinforcing that object 7 alone does not turn the machine on.\n\nFrom this analysis, object 0 was placed on the machine, and the light did not turn on.
