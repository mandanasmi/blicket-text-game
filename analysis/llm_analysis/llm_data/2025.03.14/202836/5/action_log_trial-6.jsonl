This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n\n3. **Adding Object 1**:\n   - After placing all other objects on the machine, I added object 1, and the light turned on. This indicates that object 1, in combination with at least one other object, can turn the machine on.\n\n4. **Removing Object 1**:\n   - I removed object 1, and the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is necessary for the machine to be on in the current configuration.\n\n5. **Re-adding Object 1**:\n   - I placed object 1 back on the machine, and the light turned on again. This confirms that object 1 is indeed necessary for the machine to turn on in the presence of other objects.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 1 is a blicket because its presence affects the state of the machine. Specifically, the machine's light turns on when object 1 is on the machine with other objects, and it turns off when object 1 is removed. This indicates that object 1 has a nonzero mutual information with the machine's state, fulfilling the definition of a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
