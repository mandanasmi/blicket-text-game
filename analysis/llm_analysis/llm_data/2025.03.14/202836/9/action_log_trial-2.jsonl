From the tests, objects 1 and 5 are confirmed blickets. Object 6 needs further testing to confirm its status, but object 7 was tested alone and did not turn the machine on, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the light status, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
