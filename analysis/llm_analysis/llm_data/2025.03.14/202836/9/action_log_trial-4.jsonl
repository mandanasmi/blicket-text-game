You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it.

Initially, the machine was off with object 4 on it. Removing object 4 did not change the state, indicating object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n2. Placing objects 0 and 1 on the machine did not turn it on, suggesting neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n\n3. Placing object 2 on the machine turned it on, indicating object 2 is a blicket.\n\n4. Removing object 2 turned the machine off, confirming object 2's status as a blicket.\n\n5. Placing object 3 on the machine did not turn it on, suggesting object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n6. Placing object 5 on the machine turned it on, indicating object 5 is a blicket.\n\n7. Placing object 6 on the machine kept it on, suggesting object 6 is a blicket.\n\n8. Placing object 7 on the machine kept it on, suggesting object 7 is a blicket.\n\n9. Removing object 1 did not turn the machine off, confirming object 1 is not a blicket.\n\nSince the machine remained on with objects 5, 6, and 7 on it, and given that removing object 1 did not affect the machine's state, it suggests that objects 5, 6, and 7 are all blickets.
