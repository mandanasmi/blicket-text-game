Initially, objects 0 through 6 were placed on the machine one by one, and the machine's light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 7 has a unique property that can activate the machine, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\n3. After object 7 was placed on the machine, I removed objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, and the light remained on. This further supports that these objects do not affect the machine's state when object 7 is present.\n\n4. Finally, when object 6 was removed, the light turned off. This indicates that object 6, in combination with object 7, was necessary to keep the machine on. However, since object 7 was the only object that initially turned the machine on, it is the primary blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is indeed a blicket because it can independently turn the machine on, and object 6 is likely a secondary factor that can influence the machine's state when combined with object 7.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
