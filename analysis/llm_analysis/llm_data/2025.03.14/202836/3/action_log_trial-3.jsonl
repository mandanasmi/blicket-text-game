This indicates that the combination of object 0 and object 1 together turns the machine on.\n\n3. **Inference:**\n   - Since no single object turned the machine on, and the combination of object 0 and object 1 did, it suggests that the rule might involve a specific combination of objects rather than individual objects being blickets.\n\n4. **Next Steps:**\n   - To confirm this hypothesis, we should test other combinations to see if any other pairs or groups of objects can turn the machine on. However, given the current information, it seems likely that the rule involves specific combinations rather than individual objects.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the next logical step is to test another combination to further explore the rule.

This indicates that object 1 is a blicket.\n   - When object 1 was removed, the light turned off, confirming that object 1 is necessary to turn the machine on.\n   - Object 2 was placed on the machine with object 1, and the light remained on. However, when object 1 was removed, the light turned off, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 7 Analysis**:\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine individually, and the light remained off.\n   - Object 7 was not tested in combination with object 1, but since object 1 alone turns the machine on, and object 7 alone does not, object 7 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\nFrom these observations, object 7 does not appear to have any effect on the machine's light, either alone or in combination with other objects (except potentially with object 1, but object 1 alone is sufficient to turn the machine on).
