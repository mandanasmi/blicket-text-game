You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Initially, objects 1 and 3 were on the machine, and the light was off. This suggests that neither object 1 nor object 3 is a blicket.\n\n2. After removing objects 1 and 3, I placed objects 0, 2, 4, and 5 on the machine one by one, and the light remained off. This suggests that none of these objects (0, 2, 4, 5) are blickets.\n\n3. When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket.\n\n4. I then placed object 7 on the machine while object 6 was still on it, and the light remained on. This does not provide information about object 7, as object 6 is already known to be a blicket and could be responsible for the light being on.\n\n5. After removing object 6, the light remained on with object 7 still on the machine. This suggests that object 7 is also a blicket because the light stayed on without object 6.\n\n6. Finally, when object 7 was removed, the light turned off, confirming that object 7 was contributing to the light being on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
