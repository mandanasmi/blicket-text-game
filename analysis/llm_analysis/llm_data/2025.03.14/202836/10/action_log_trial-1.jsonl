You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them.

This suggests that object 6 could be a blicket.\n   - However, to confirm, we need to see if object 6 can turn the light on by itself or if it requires another blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 6 was removed, and the light turned off, indicating that object 6 was contributing to the light being on.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 7 might also be a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine again, and the light turned on. This reinforces the possibility that object 6 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Consideration:**\n   - The light turned on with object 6 alone, and it turned off when object 6 was removed, suggesting that object 6 is indeed a blicket.\n   - The light also turned on with object 7, but since object 6 alone could turn the light on, it confirms object 6's status as a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 6 is a blicket because it can independently turn the machine's light on.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets.

Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests these objects are not blickets.\n   - Object 3 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This indicates object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 6 is a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on. This suggests object 7 is a blicket.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - When object 3 was removed, the light turned off, confirming object 3's status as a blicket.\n   - When object 6 was removed, the light turned off, confirming object 6's status as a blicket.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine with object 3, and the light was on. When object 7 was removed, the light turned off, indicating that object 7 alone did not keep the light on. This suggests that object 7 might not be a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The light turned on when object 7 was placed on the machine, but it was also on with other objects. The critical test is whether object 7 alone can turn the light on, which was not confirmed. The light turned off when object 7 was removed, but it was also off when object 3 was removed, indicating object 3 was the active blicket.\n   - Therefore, object 7 does not independently cause the machine to turn on, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
