This indicates that object 0 has a direct effect on the machine's state, suggesting it is a blicket.\n- Object 1 and object 2 do not affect the machine's state, as the light remains off when they are placed on the machine individually.\n- Object 3, like object 0, also causes the light to turn on when placed on the machine, indicating it is also a blicket.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on seems to be that any single blicket object placed on the machine will turn the light on.
