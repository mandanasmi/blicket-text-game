So far, I've tested each object individually and in some combinations, but the machine has not turned on. This suggests that either none of the objects are blickets, or the rule requires a specific combination of objects to be on the machine simultaneously.\n\nSince I've already tested each object individually and the combination of objects 1 and 2, I should now test the combination of all three objects together. If the machine still doesn't turn on, it might indicate that none of the objects are blickets, or that the rule is more complex than just a simple combination.\n\nPotential issues include not having tested all possible combinations yet, and the possibility of a more complex rule involving the order of objects or other factors.\n\nNext, I will test the combination of all three objects on the machine.\n\n> put object 1 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.
