The light on the machine is now on.\n\nBased on the information you have gathered, answer the following question: Is object 2 a blicket?\n\nPlease first reflect on the collected information and analyze any potential issues with your reasoning, then output the final answer in the format '> True/False'. Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, let's analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. When object 0 is on the machine alone, the light turns on. This suggests object 0 is a blicket.\n2. When object 1 is on the machine alone, the light remains off. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n3. When object 2 is on the machine alone, the light remains off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n4. When both objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, the light turns on. This is consistent with object 0 being a blicket.\n5. When both objects 0 and 2 are on the machine, the light turns on. This is also consistent with object 0 being a blicket.\n6. When object 0 is removed and only object 2 remains, the light turns off. This further suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nThe key observation is that the light turns on whenever object 0 is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects. The light does not turn on with object 2 alone, indicating that object 2 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
