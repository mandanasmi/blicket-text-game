You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "Let's analyze the information:\n\n1. When object 2 is placed on the machine alone, the light turns on. This suggests that object 2 is a blicket.\n2. When object 0 is placed on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. This suggests that object 0 is not a blicket.\n3. When object 1 is placed on the machine alone, the light does not turn on. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket.\n4. When object 2 is on the machine with object 0, the light turns on. This further supports that object 2 is a blicket.\n5. When object 2 is removed from the machine, the light turns off, regardless of whether object 0 or object 1 is on the machine. This indicates that object 2 is necessary for the light to turn on.\n\nThe consistent result is that the presence of object 2 on the machine is required for the light to turn on, indicating that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
