You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, object 2 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When object 0 was placed on the machine with object 2, the light turned on.\n3. Removing object 0 turned the light off, even though object 2 remained on the machine.\n4. Placing object 1 on the machine with object 2 did not turn the light on.\n5. The light turned on when both objects 0 and 1 were on the machine, regardless of object 2's presence.\n6. Removing object 1 while object 0 was on the machine turned the light off, indicating object 1's role in turning the light on.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that object 2 does not contribute to turning the machine on. The light only turns on when both objects 0 and 1 are on the machine, suggesting that the rule requires both of these objects to be present for the machine to activate. Object 2 does not seem to have any effect on the machine's state.\n\nTherefore, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
