Adding object 0 to the machine when either object 1 or 2 is already on it does not turn the machine off.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, as they can independently turn the machine on. Object 0 does not seem to be a blicket, as it does not turn the machine on by itself and does not affect the machine's state when added with other objects.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that at least one blicket (either object 1 or object 2) must be on the machine for it to turn on. Object 0 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\nI have tested various combinations and confirmed that objects 1 and 2 are necessary for the machine to turn on. Therefore, I am confident in my conclusion.\n\nNow, I will exit the game as I have identified the blickets and inferred the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
