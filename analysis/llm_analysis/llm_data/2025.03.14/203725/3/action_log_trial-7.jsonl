You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. When object 1 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.\n3. Adding object 2 while object 1 was on the machine kept the light on.\n4. Removing object 1 while object 2 was still on the machine kept the light on.\n5. Removing object 2 turned the light off.\n6. Placing object 0 back on the machine with object 2 did not turn the light on.\n7. Placing object 1 on the machine with object 2 turned the light on.\n8. Removing object 1 while object 2 was on the machine kept the light on.\n9. Removing object 2 turned the light off.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- Object 1 is a blicket because it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.\n- Object 2 also seems to be a blicket because when it is on the machine alone, the light turns on. Additionally, when object 1 is removed and object 2 remains, the light stays on, indicating object 2 can independently activate the machine.\n\nTherefore, object 2 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
