When objects 0, 1, and 2 are on the machine together, the light is on.\n6. When objects 1 and 2 are on the machine together, the light is off.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that object 0 is a blicket because it consistently turns the machine on when it is on the machine, regardless of the presence of other objects. Object 2 does not turn the machine on by itself, but it does not prevent the machine from turning on when object 0 is present. Object 1 does not seem to affect the machine's state at all.\n\nThe rule for the machine turning on appears to be that object 0 must be on the machine. Object 2 can be present, but it is not necessary for the machine to turn on. Object 1 does not contribute to turning the machine on.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I will test the machine with only object 0 on it again to ensure consistency.\n\n> put object 0 on machine", "history_obs": "You are in a room.

You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

Initially, object 1 was on the machine, and the light was off.\n2. After removing object 1 and placing object 0 on the machine, the light remained off.\n3. Adding object 1 to the machine with object 0 still resulted in the light being off.\n4. When object 2 was added to the machine with objects 0 and 1, the light turned on.\n5. Removing object 0 while object 2 was still on the machine turned the light off.\n6. Placing object 2 alone on the machine kept the light off.\n7. Adding object 0 to the machine with object 2 turned the light on.\n8. Removing object 1 while objects 0 and 2 were on the machine kept the light on.\n9. Removing object 0 while object 2 was still on the machine turned the light off.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- Object 2 alone does not turn the machine on.\n- Object 0 alone does not turn the machine on.\n- The combination of objects 0 and 2 turns the machine on.\n\nA blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine. Since the presence of object 2, in combination with object 0, affects the state of the machine (turning it on), object 2 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
