You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "Interact with the environment to find the blickets and discover the rule.\nYou are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 3 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> put object 0 on machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine.

When object 2 was placed on the machine, the light remained on, even after object 0 was removed. This suggests that object 2 is also a blicket.\n4. Removing object 1 while object 2 was still on the machine kept the light on, indicating that object 2 alone can keep the machine on.\n5. Removing object 2 turned the light off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule for the machine turning on is that at least one blicket must be on the machine. Objects 1 and 2 are blickets, while object 0 is not.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, I should test object 0 again to ensure it doesn't affect the machine when placed alone. However, given the current observations, I am confident in my conclusion.\n\nNow, I will exit the game as I believe I have identified the blickets and the rule.\n\n> exit", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
