This suggests that the combination of objects 0 and 2 is necessary to turn the light on.\n- Object 1, when placed on the machine alone or in combination with object 2, does not turn the light on. Additionally, object 1 does not affect the light when objects 0 and 2 are already on the machine.\n- Therefore, object 1 does not contribute to turning the machine on and does not have any mutual information with the machine's state.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nObject 1 is not a blicket because its presence or absence does not affect the state of the machine.
