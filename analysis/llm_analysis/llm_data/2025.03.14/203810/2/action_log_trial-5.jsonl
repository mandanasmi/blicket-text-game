You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n- A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine (in other words, the object's state distribution and the machine's state distribution have nonzero mutual information)\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

However, since object 0 alone does not turn the light on, and object 2 alone does not turn the light on, this suggests that neither object 0 nor object 2 is a blicket. The light turning on with both objects might be due to object 1 being previously on the machine, or some other factor not related to object 2 being a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 1 is confirmed to be a blicket because it consistently turns the light on when placed on the machine.\n   - Object 2 does not turn the light on when placed on the machine alone, and its presence with object 0 does not provide enough evidence to suggest it is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the observations and analysis, object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
