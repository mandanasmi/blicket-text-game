This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket, as it contributes to turning the light on when combined with object 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The machine turns on when object 0 is present with either object 1 or object 2, indicating that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 2, when combined with object 0, turns the light on, suggesting it also has blicket properties.\n   - Object 1 does not contribute to turning the light on when combined with object 2, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions and the light status, object 2 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
