Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 3 objects scattered around the room. You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on the floor, object 2 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is currently off. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> put object 0 on machine\nYou put object 0 on the machine.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 2 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine:\n\n1. Initially, all objects are on the floor, and the machine is off.\n2. Placing object 0 on the machine does not turn it on.\n3. Placing object 1 on the machine does not turn it on.\n4. Placing object 2 on the machine turns the machine on. This suggests that object 2 might be a blicket.\n5. Removing object 0 from the machine (while object 1 and 2 are still on it) turns the machine off. This indicates that object 0 is not a blicket and that object 2 might be the key to turning the machine on.\n6. Removing object 1 from the machine (while object 2 is still on it) keeps the machine off, reinforcing that object 1 is not a blicket.\n7. Removing object 2 from the machine turns the machine off, confirming that object 2 is necessary to turn the machine on.\n8. Placing object 2 back on the machine does not turn it on, which is unexpected. However, this might be due to a reset or a specific condition not met.\n9. Placing object 0 on the machine with object 2 turns the machine on again, suggesting that object 2 is indeed a blicket, and object 0 does not interfere with its ability to turn the machine on.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that object 2 is the only object that consistently turns the machine on when placed on it, either alone or with other objects. Therefore, object 2 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 3 objects scattered around the room.
