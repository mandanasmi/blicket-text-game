You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.\n\nYou will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.\n", "prompt": "You are in a room.

Initially, objects 0 and 1 were placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that neither object 0 nor object 1 alone can turn the machine on.\n\n2. When object 2 was added to the machine (with object 1 still on it), the light remained off. This suggests that object 2 alone or in combination with object 1 does not turn the machine on.\n\n3. When object 3 was added to the machine (with object 2 still on it), the light turned on. This indicates that object 3 might be a blicket, as it caused the machine to turn on when added.\n\n4. After removing object 1, the light turned off, suggesting that object 1 might also be a blicket, as its presence was necessary for the light to be on with object 3.\n\n5. When object 1 was placed back on the machine with object 3, the light turned on again. This further supports the idea that object 1 is a blicket.\n\n6. Removing object 1 turned the light off, reinforcing that object 1 is necessary for the machine to be on.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the machine turns on when both object 1 and object 3 are on it.
