Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine and the resulting light status.\n\n1. **Initial Observations:**\n   - Object 0 on the machine: Light off.\n   - Object 1 on the machine: Light off.\n   - Object 2 on the machine: Light on.\n   - Object 3 on the machine: Light on.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations:**\n   - Object 2 and 3 together: Light on.\n   - Removing object 2 (leaving object 3): Light on.\n   - Removing object 3 (leaving object 2): Light off.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 1 and 0 together: Light off.\n   - Object 3 alone: Light on.\n   - Object 2 alone: Light on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Object 2 is a blicket because it turns the light on when placed on the machine alone.\n- Object 3 is also a blicket because it turns the light on when placed on the machine alone.\n- Objects 0 and 1 do not turn the light on, either alone or in combination with each other, indicating they are not blickets.\n\nThe key observation is that when object 3 is on the machine alone, the light turns on, confirming that object 3 has blicktness.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
