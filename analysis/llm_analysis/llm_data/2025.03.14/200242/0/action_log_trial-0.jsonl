You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it.

Initially, object 0 was on the machine, and the light was off. After removing object 0, the light remained off. This suggests object 0 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n2. Placing object 1 on the machine did not turn the light on, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n\n3. Placing object 2 on the machine also did not turn the light on, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n\n4. Placing object 3 on the machine did not initially turn the light on, but when object 0 was added, the light turned on. This suggests a possible interaction between objects 0 and 3.\n\n5. Removing object 0 while object 3 was on the machine turned the light off, indicating object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n6. When object 0 was placed back on the machine with object 3, the light turned on again. This reinforces the idea that both objects together activate the machine.\n\n7. Removing object 3 while object 0 was on the machine turned the light off, further supporting that object 3 alone does not activate the machine.\n\n8. Finally, placing object 3 on the machine with object 0 turned the light on, confirming the interaction between these two objects.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that neither object 0 nor object 3 alone can activate the machine, but together they do. This suggests that the rule for the machine involves a combination of objects, specifically objects 0 and 3 together.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket on its own, as it does not activate the machine without object 0.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
