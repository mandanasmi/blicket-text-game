Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the sequence of actions and the machine's responses:\n\n1. Initially, objects 2 and 3 were on the machine, and the machine was off.\n2. Removing object 2 from the machine did not change the machine's state; it remained off.\n3. Removing object 3 from the machine also did not change the machine's state; it remained off.\n4. Placing object 0 on the machine did not turn the machine on.\n5. Placing object 1 on the machine did not turn the machine on.\n6. Placing object 2 on the machine did not turn the machine on.\n7. Placing object 3 on the machine turned the machine on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer the following:\n\n- The machine was off when only object 2 was on it, indicating object 2 is not a blicket.\n- The machine was off when only object 0 or object 1 was on it, indicating neither object 0 nor object 1 is a blicket.\n- The machine turned on when object 3 was placed on it, regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is a blicket because it is the only object that, when placed on the machine, causes the machine to turn on.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
