You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it. Blickets make the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Identify which objects are blickets.\n- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. \n\nHere are the available commands:\n  look:                describe the current room\n  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor\n  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine\n  exit:                exit the game\n\nTips:\n- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.\n- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.\n\n\nYou have 32 steps to complete the task.

This suggests that object 3 might be a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Testing:**\n   - Object 2 was removed while object 3 was on the machine, and the light turned off. This indicates that object 3 alone is not sufficient to turn the light on.\n   - When object 3 was placed back on the machine, the light turned on again, but only when object 2 was also on the machine.\n\n4. **Combination Testing:**\n   - With object 3 on the machine, adding object 1 turned the light on. This suggests that object 3 might work in combination with other objects to turn the light on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 3 alone does not turn the machine on, but it seems to be part of a combination that can turn the machine on. This suggests that object 3 is a blicket, but it requires another object (like object 2 or object 1) to activate the machine.\n\nBased on this reasoning, object 3 is indeed a blicket, as it is part of the combination that can turn the machine on.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
