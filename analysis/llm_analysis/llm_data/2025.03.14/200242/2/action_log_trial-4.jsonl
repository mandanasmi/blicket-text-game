However, when placed again later, it turned the light on when combined with other objects.\n   - **Object 1:** Placing it on the machine did not turn the light on initially. However, when combined with other objects, it contributed to turning the light on.\n   - **Object 2:** Placing it on the machine did not turn the light on, and removing it did not affect the light when it was on.\n   - **Object 3:** Placing it on the machine did not turn the light on.\n\n3. **Combination Testing:**\n   - When objects 0, 1, and 2 were on the machine, the light was off.\n   - Adding object 3 did not change the state (light remained off).\n   - When object 0 was placed on the machine again, the light turned on, indicating a possible combination effect.\n   - Removing object 1 turned the light off, suggesting object 1 is necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Placing object 1 back on turned the light on again, confirming its role.\n   - Removing object 2 did not turn the light off, indicating object 2 is not necessary for the light to be on.\n   - Removing object 0 turned the light off, confirming its role.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Objects 0 and 1 are necessary to turn the machine on.
