Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. **Initial Observations:**\n   - Object 0 on the machine: Light turns on.\n   - Object 1 on the machine: Light stays off.\n   - Object 2 on the machine: Light turns on.\n   - Object 3 on the machine: Light turns on.\n\n2. **Further Testing:**\n   - After placing object 1, 2, and 3 on the machine, the light was on. Removing object 1 did not affect the light, indicating object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 turned the light off, suggesting object 2 is a blicket.\n   - After removing object 2, the light turned off, even though object 3 was still on the machine. This suggests that object 3 alone does not turn the light on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 0 and object 2 are confirmed blickets because they independently turn the light on.\n   - Object 3 does not turn the light on when placed alone, and the light turned off when object 2 was removed, even though object 3 was still on the machine. This indicates that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
