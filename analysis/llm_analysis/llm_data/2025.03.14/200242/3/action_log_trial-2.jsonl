Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions with the machine:\n\n1. **Initial Observations:**\n   - Object 0 on the machine turns the light on.\n   - Object 1 on the machine does not turn the light on.\n   - Object 2 on the machine turns the light on.\n   - Object 3 on the machine turns the light on.\n\n2. **Testing Combinations:**\n   - When object 1 is on the machine with object 2, the light is on. Since object 1 alone does not turn the light on, object 2 must be a blicket.\n   - When object 1 is on the machine with object 3, the light is on. Since object 1 alone does not turn the light on, object 3 must be a blicket.\n   - When object 0 is on the machine with object 1, the light is on. Since object 1 alone does not turn the light on, object 0 must be a blicket.\n\n3. **Removing Objects:**\n   - Removing object 1 when object 0, 2, and 3 are on the machine keeps the light on, confirming object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - Removing object 2 when object 0 and 3 are on the machine keeps the light on, confirming object 0 and 3 are blickets.\n   - Removing object 0 when only object 3 is left on the machine keeps the light on, confirming object 3 is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that object 3 is indeed a blicket because it can independently turn the machine on when placed on it.\n\n> True", "history_obs": "You are in a room.
