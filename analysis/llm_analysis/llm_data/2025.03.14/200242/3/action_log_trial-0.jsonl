You observe them: object 0 is on the floor, object 1 is on top of the machine, object 2 is on top of the machine, object 3 is on the floor. \n\nThe machine hums softly in front of you, seemingly waiting. The light on the machine is now on. You wonder if there is a relationship between the objects and the machine.\n> take object 1 off machine\nYou took object 1 off of the machine.

Ensure only one answer is included.", "response_message": "To determine if object 3 is a blicket, we need to analyze the interactions between the objects and the machine:\n\n1. Initially, objects 1 and 2 were on the machine, and the light was on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n2. After removing object 1, the light remained on, indicating that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n3. Removing object 2 turned the light off, confirming that object 2 is indeed a blicket.\n\n4. Placing object 0 on the machine did not turn the light on, indicating that object 0 is not a blicket.\n\n5. Placing object 3 on the machine also did not turn the light on, suggesting that object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n6. Placing object 2 back on the machine turned the light on again, reinforcing that object 2 is a blicket.\n\n7. Removing object 2 turned the light off, and placing object 1 on the machine turned the light on, indicating that object 1 is also a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that objects 1 and 2 are blickets, while objects 0 and 3 are not. Therefore, object 3 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "history_obs": "You are in a room. You see a machine at the center of this room. \n\nThere are also 4 objects scattered around the room.
