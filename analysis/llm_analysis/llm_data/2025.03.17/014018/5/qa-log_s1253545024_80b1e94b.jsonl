This means there is a dependency between the object's presence on the machine and the machine's state (on/off).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Interactions**:\n   - **Object 0**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 1**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 1 is not a blicket.\n   - **Object 2**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 2 is not a blicket.\n   - **Object 3**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 3 is not a blicket.\n   - **Object 4**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 4 is not a blicket.\n   - **Object 5**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 5 is not a blicket.\n   - **Object 6**: When placed on the machine, the light turns on. When removed, the light turns off. This indicates that object 6 is a blicket.\n   - **Object 7**: When placed on the machine, the light remains off. This suggests object 7 is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The machine turns on only when object 0 or object 6 is placed on it. For all other objects, including object 5, the machine remains off.\n   - Since placing object 5 on the machine does not turn the light on, object 5 does not have the property of a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the interactions, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 778, "total_tokens": 1214}, "estimated_cost": 0.006305, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.16/170513/22/action_log_trial-4.jsonl"}
