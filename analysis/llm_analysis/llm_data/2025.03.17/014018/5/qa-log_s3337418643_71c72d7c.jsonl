This suggests that object 7 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Analysis of Object 5:**\n   - When object 5 is placed on the machine, the light remains off. This indicates that object 5 does not have the property that turns the machine on.\n   - Since the light only turns on with object 7, and not with object 5, object 5 does not affect the machine's state.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - A blicket is defined as an object whose state is not independent of the state of the machine. Since object 5 does not change the state of the machine (the light remains off), it does not have any mutual information with the machine's state.\n   - Therefore, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 5 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 322, "prompt_tokens": 698, "total_tokens": 1020}, "estimated_cost": 0.004965000000000001, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/4/action_log_trial-1.jsonl"}
