This confirms that object 4 is a blicket, as its presence consistently correlates with the machine being on.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 4 is indeed a blicket because its presence on the machine consistently results in the machine's light turning on, and its removal results in the light turning off.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 860, "total_tokens": 1266}, "estimated_cost": 0.00621, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/10/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
