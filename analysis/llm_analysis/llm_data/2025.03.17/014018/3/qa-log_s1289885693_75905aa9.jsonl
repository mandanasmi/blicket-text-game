This suggests that object 4 could be a blicket.\n   - When object 4 was removed, the light turned off, which is consistent with object 4 being a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine again, and the light turned on, further supporting that object 4 is a blicket.\n   - Removing object 4 again turned the light off, reinforcing the idea that object 4 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Objects 5, 6, and 7:**\n   - Placing objects 5, 6, and 7 on the machine did not turn the light on, indicating they are not blickets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The machine turns on when either object 3 or object 4 is placed on it, and turns off when they are removed. This consistent behavior strongly indicates that both objects 3 and 4 are blickets.\n- Since the question specifically asks if object 4 is a blicket, based on the evidence, object 4 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 437, "prompt_tokens": 847, "total_tokens": 1284}, "estimated_cost": 0.0064875, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/10/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
