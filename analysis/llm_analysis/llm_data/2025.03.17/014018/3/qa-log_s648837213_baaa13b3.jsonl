This indicates that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - Removing objects 0, 1, and 2 while object 3 was on the machine kept the light on until object 2 was removed, which turned the light off. This suggests that object 2 might also be a blicket, but object 3 is definitely a blicket since it initially turned the light on.\n\n3. **Interactions with Object 4:**\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine with object 3, and the light was off. This suggests that object 4 is not a blicket because it did not contribute to turning the light on when combined with object 3.\n\n4. **Further Confirmation:**\n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine alone, the light was off. However, when object 2 was added, the light turned on. This confirms that object 2 is also a blicket, and the rule might require both object 2 and object 3 to be on the machine for the light to turn on.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since object 4 did not turn the light on when placed on the machine with object 3, and given the interactions, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, object 4 is not a blicket.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 928, "total_tokens": 1302}, "estimated_cost": 0.006059999999999999, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/4/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
