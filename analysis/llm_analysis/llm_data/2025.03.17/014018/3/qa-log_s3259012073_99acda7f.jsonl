Initially, objects 0 and 3 are on the machine, and the light is on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n2. When object 0 is removed, the light remains on. This indicates that object 0 is not necessary for the light to be on, suggesting it might not be a blicket.\n\n3. When object 3 is removed, the light turns off.
