This indicates that object 7 has the ability to activate the machine, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - To confirm, object 7 was removed, and the light turned off, which is consistent with the behavior of a blicket being removed.\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine again, and the light turned on once more, reinforcing the idea that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The consistent activation of the machine's light when object 7 is placed on it, and the deactivation when it is removed, strongly indicates that object 7 is a blicket.
