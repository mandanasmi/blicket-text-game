This indicates that object 4 is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Subsequent Tests:**\n   - After object 4 was placed on the machine and the light turned on, objects 0, 1, 2, and 3 were removed one by one, and the light remained on. This further supports that these objects are not blickets and that object 4 is responsible for the light being on.\n   - When object 4 was removed, the light turned off, confirming that object 4 is indeed a blicket.\n\n3. **Further Confirmation:**\n   - Object 5 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 6 was placed on the machine, and the light turned on, indicating that object 6 is also a blicket.\n   - When object 5 was removed, the light stayed on, confirming object 5 is not a blicket.\n   - When object 6 was removed, the light turned off, confirming object 6 is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Test with Object 7:**\n   - Object 7 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - Object 4 was placed back on the machine, and the light turned on again, confirming once more that object 4 is a blicket.\n\nBased on these observations, object 4 consistently causes the machine's light to turn on when it is placed on the machine, and the light turns off when it is removed. This strongly indicates that object 4 is a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 425, "prompt_tokens": 808, "total_tokens": 1233}, "estimated_cost": 0.0062699999999999995, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/10/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
