This suggests that object 4 might be a blicket.\n\n3. **Testing Object 4:**\n   - Object 4 was removed, and the light turned off, indicating that object 4 alone can activate the machine, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - When both objects 3 and 4 were on the machine, the light was on. Removing object 3 left the light on, confirming that object 4 can independently activate the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Object 4, when placed on the machine alone, turns the light on.
