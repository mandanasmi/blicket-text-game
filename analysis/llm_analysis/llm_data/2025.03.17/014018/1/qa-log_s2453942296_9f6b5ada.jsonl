Object 1 does not seem to be a blicket because the machine turns off when object 0 is removed, even if object 1 is still on the machine.\n\n2. **Further Observations:**\n   - Object 2 on the machine: Light remains off.\n   - Object 3 on the machine: Light turns on.\n   - Removing object 2: Light remains on.\n   - Removing object 3: Light turns off.\n\n   Here, object 3 is a blicket because it turns the machine on by itself. Object 2 is not a blicket because it does not affect the machine's state.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects:**\n   - Object 4 on the machine: Light remains off.\n   - Object 5 on the machine: Light remains off.\n   - Removing object 4: Light remains off.\n   - Removing object 5: Light remains off.\n\n   Neither object 4 nor object 5 turns the machine on, indicating that neither is a blicket.\n\n4. **Final Observations:**\n   - Object 6 on the machine: Light remains off.\n   - Object 7 on the machine: Light remains off.\n   - Removing object 6: Light remains off.\n   - Removing object 7: Light remains off.\n\n   Similarly, neither object 6 nor object 7 turns the machine on, indicating that neither is a blicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the interactions, the machine turns on when either object 0 or object 3 is on it.
