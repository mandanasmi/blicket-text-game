When object 3 was placed back on the machine alone, the light remained off, indicating that object 3 alone is not sufficient to turn the light on. It needs to be combined with another object, likely object 2, to turn the light on.\n\n6. Object 4 was placed on the machine, and the light remained off. This suggests that object 4 is not a blicket, as it did not turn the light on either alone or in combination with object 3.\n\n7. Finally, when object 2 was placed on the machine with object 3, the light turned on again, confirming that the combination of objects 2 and 3 is necessary to activate the machine.\n\nBased on this analysis, object 4 is not a blicket because it did not contribute to turning the machine on in any of the interactions.\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 378, "prompt_tokens": 917, "total_tokens": 1295}, "estimated_cost": 0.0060725, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/4/action_log_trial-2.jsonl"}
