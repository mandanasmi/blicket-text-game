This suggests that none of these objects are blickets on their own.\n\n2. **Object 4:**\n   - When object 4 was placed on the machine, the light turned on.

However, when object 1 was placed on the machine without object 4, the light was off. This suggests that object 1 is not a blicket on its own, but it can work with object 4 to keep the light on.\n\n4. **Further Testing:**\n   - When object 4 was removed while object 1 was on the machine, the light turned off.
