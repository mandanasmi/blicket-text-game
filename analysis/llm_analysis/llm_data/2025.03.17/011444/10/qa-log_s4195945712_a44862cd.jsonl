This indicates a strong correlation between object 4 and the machine's state.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 do not turn the machine on when placed on it alone.\n   - Object 1 does turn the machine on when placed on it, but it does not do so consistently (it was off when removed and on when placed again). This suggests that object 1 may also be a blicket, but it is not as consistently reliable as object 4.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 4 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it and the light turns off when it is removed, it indicates that object 4 has a direct relationship with the machine's state. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that object 4 is indeed a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 994, "total_tokens": 1335}, "estimated_cost": 0.0003537, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.16/170513/10/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
