When objects 0 through 6 were placed on the machine, the light remained off for all of them. This indicates that none of these objects (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are blickets, as they did not activate the machine.\n\n2. When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This suggests that object 7 is a blicket, as it is the only object that activated the machine.\n\n3. The subsequent actions confirm that object 7 consistently activates the machine when placed on it, while removing it turns the machine off.\n\nSince object 6 was tested and did not activate the machine, we can conclude that it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is object 6 a blicket?\" is:\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 649, "total_tokens": 843}, "estimated_cost": 0.00021375, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/4/action_log_trial-1.jsonl"}
