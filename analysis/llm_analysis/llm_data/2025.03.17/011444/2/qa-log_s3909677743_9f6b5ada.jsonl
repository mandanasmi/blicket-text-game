When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 0 is a blicket.\n   - Object 1: When placed on the machine, the light turned on. When removed, the light turned off. This suggests that object 1 is also a blicket.\n   - Object 2: When placed on the machine, the light did not turn on. However, when it was removed, the light turned on with object 3.
