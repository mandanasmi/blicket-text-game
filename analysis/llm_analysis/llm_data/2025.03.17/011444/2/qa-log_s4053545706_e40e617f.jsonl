This suggests that object 3 is a blicket.\n   - When object 0, 1, or 2 is placed on the machine individually, the light remains off.

However, this is inconsistent with previous tests where object 0 was placed on the machine and the light was off.\n\n3. **Inconsistencies**:\n   - The light turned on with object 0 only when it was placed on the machine after object 3 was tested. This suggests that the machine's response may depend on the combination of objects or the order in which they are placed.\n   - The repeated tests with object 0 show that it can turn the machine on in some instances but not in others, which raises questions about the consistency of its status as a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Object 0 has shown the ability to turn the machine on in certain contexts, but it has also failed to do so in others.
