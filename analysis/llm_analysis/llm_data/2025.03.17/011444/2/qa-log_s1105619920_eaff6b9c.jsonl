This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   \n2. **Object 5**: \n   - When object 5 was placed on the machine, the light turned on. This indicates that object 5 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 5 was removed from the machine, the light turned off, which further supports the idea that object 5 is a blicket.\n\n3. **Object 6**: \n   - When object 6 was placed on the machine, the light turned on, indicating that it is also likely a blicket. Removing it turned the light off, confirming this.\n\n4. **Object 7**: \n   - When object 7 was placed on the machine, the light remained off, suggesting that it is not a blicket. However, when it was removed, the light turned on, which is inconsistent with the previous observation. This could imply that the machine's response is influenced by the presence of other objects.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Object 5 consistently caused the machine to turn on when placed on it and turned off when removed.
