This indicates that object 4 has some property (blicktness) that activates the machine.\n\n2. **Testing Object 4**:\n   - When object 4 is taken off the machine, the light turns off. This reinforces the idea that object 4 is responsible for turning the machine on when placed on it.\n   - Object 4 was placed on the machine multiple times, and each time it was placed, the light turned on. This consistent behavior suggests that object 4 has a strong relationship with the machine.\n\n3. **Testing Other Objects**:\n   - Objects 0, 1, 2, and 3 were also tested. When they were placed on the machine, the light remained off until object 4 was placed. \n   - When object 3 was placed on the machine after object 4 was removed, the light turned on, indicating that object 3 also has the property of blicktness.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since object 4 consistently activates the machine when placed on it and the machine turns off when it is removed, we can conclude that object 4 is indeed a blicket.
