This indicates that object 4 is likely a blicket.\n   - When object 4 was removed, the light turned off, confirming that object 4 is indeed responsible for turning the machine on.\n\n3. **Object 1**: \n   - Object 1 was placed on the machine and the light turned on, but it was previously off when tested alone. This suggests that object 1 might also be a blicket, but it was not consistent in its behavior since it turned off when removed and only turned on again when placed back.\n\n4. **Other Objects**: \n   - Objects 5, 6, and 7 were tested and did not turn the machine on, indicating they are not blickets.\n\n5. **Final Confirmation**: \n   - The consistent behavior of object 4 turning the machine on when placed and off when removed strongly supports the conclusion that object 4 is a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that object 4 is indeed a blicket.\n\n> True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 953, "total_tokens": 1255}, "estimated_cost": 0.00032415, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.16/170513/10/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
