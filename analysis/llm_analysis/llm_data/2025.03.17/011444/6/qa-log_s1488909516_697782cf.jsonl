This indicates that object 7 is a blicket, as it is the only object that has caused the machine to activate.\n\n3. **Testing Object 7**: The agent then removes object 7 and places it back on the machine, confirming that the light turns on each time it is placed on the machine. This further solidifies that object 7 is indeed a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion about Object 6**: Since all previous objects (0 to 6) did not activate the machine, and only object 7 did, we can conclude that object 6 is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is object 6 a blicket?\" is:\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "false", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 687, "total_tokens": 945}, "estimated_cost": 0.00025785, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.16/170513/10/action_log_trial-1.jsonl"}
