This suggests that object 5 is likely a blicket because removing it caused the machine to stop functioning.\n\n3. **Re-adding Object 5**: \n   - When object 5 is placed back on the machine, the light turns on again. This further supports the idea that object 5 is a blicket, as it is the only object being manipulated at that moment.\n\n4. **Testing Other Objects**: \n   - Object 0 is placed on the machine, and the light is on. This indicates that object 0 could also be a blicket.\n   - Objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are placed on the machine, and the light remains off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - Object 6 is placed on the machine, and the light turns on, indicating that object 6 is also a blicket.\n\n5. **Final Confirmation**: \n   - The interactions confirm that object 5 consistently causes the machine to turn on when placed on it and turns it off when removed. This behavior aligns with the characteristics of a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we conclude that object 5 is indeed a blicket.\n\nFinal answer: > True", "answer": "true", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "true", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 340, "prompt_tokens": 763, "total_tokens": 1103}, "estimated_cost": 0.00031844999999999996, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.16/170513/22/action_log_trial-6.jsonl"}
