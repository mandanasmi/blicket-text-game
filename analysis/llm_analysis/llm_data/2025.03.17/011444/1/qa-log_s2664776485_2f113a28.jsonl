When object 7 was removed, the light also turned off, indicating that object 7 is not a blicket since the light did not turn on when it was placed alone after removing object 6.\n\nSince object 5 did not activate the machine at any point, we can conclude that it is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> False", "answer": "false", "true_answer": "true", "answer_correct": "false", "api_error": "false", "response_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 801, "total_tokens": 991}, "estimated_cost": 0.00023415, "traj_path": "/home/anthony/Project/rl-scm-tests/blicket_text/exp_output/2025.03.14/010942/4/action_log_trial-0.jsonl"}
